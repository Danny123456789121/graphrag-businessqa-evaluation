# ABSTRACT

For many decades, there has been a debate about the relation between corporate social/environmental performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP). Our study presents a review of academic research on this topic by applying a second-order meta-analysis. The data sample combines 25 previous meta-analyses yielding a sample size of one million observations. Our results demonstrate a highly significant, positive, robust, and bilateral CSP-CFP relation. The relation is positive regardless of whether firms focus on ecological or social aspects, though corporate reputation turns out to be a key CSP determinant. We find a particularly strong CSP-CFP relation for operational CFP. Furthermore, we add a new perspective on potential biases resulting from the studies’ publishing source: social issues-oriented journals and methodological weaker papers do not distort the positive CSP-CFP relation. Our conclusion is: Based on the extant literature, the business case for being a good firm is undeniable. © 2018 The Authors.

# Introduction

WHAT IS THE RELATION BETWEEN CORPORATE SOCIAL/ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (CSP) AND CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)? For nearly 50 years, scholars have investigated this question. The search for the answer has become particularly prominent since the end of the 1990s. Our study sample comprises 1214 empirical primary studies on the CSP-CFP relation. While considerable research has been conducted, it is as yet less clear how different CSP dimensions and CFP categories interrelate and in which way various moderating factors determine the CSP-CFP relation (Aguinis and Glavas, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Peloza, 2009). Moreover, the robustness of the business case over time has only occasionally been analyzed (Borgers, Derwall, Koedijk, & ter Horst, 2013; Derwall, Koedijk, & Ter Horst, 2011). The aim of this study is to provide a more detailed understanding of the CSP-CFP relation.

In 2003, the widely cited Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes (2003) meta-study responded to calls for a moratorium on CSP-CFP research (Margolis & Walsh, 2001; Rowley & Berman, 2000). Orlitzky et al. (2003) found a significant, positive, and bidirectional correlation of CSP with CFP. Despite these findings, the authors claim that this relation cannot be generalized across all CSP dimensions and CFP categories, detecting a large variability – even after correcting for sampling error and measurement error. Since then, the picture has become even more ambiguous and critical debates have resurfaced about the actual CSP-CFP relation (Aldag, 2013; Barnett, 2007; Borgers et al., 2013; Devinney, 2009; Fleming & Jones, 2013; Orlitzky, 2011, 2013; Wood, 2010). On the one hand, many scholars claim that, to date, the literature on the CSP-CFP relation remains inconclusive. On the other hand, a whole range of new studies and further meta-analyses have been published supporting a positive relation. Thus, more than a decade after Orlitzky et al. (2003), it seems to be the right time to revive the paper’s spirit and ask: when generalizing existing research, is there still evidence that it pays off to be a good firm?

To answer this question, we apply a second-order meta-analysis. In other scientific disciplines like medicine, psychology, or education (i.e. research areas typically also experiencing vast amounts of data and conflicting results), meta-analytic techniques are widespread and have been applied since the 1960s (Glass, 1976; Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Hunter, Schmidt, & Jackson, 1982). With the growing number of meta-analyses, the idea of cumulative meta-analysis also appeared (Kazrin, Durac, & Agteros, 1979). Several labels have been used for such analyses: overview of reviews, review of reviews, umbrella reviews, meta-reviews, cumulative meta-analyses, meta-meta-analysis, and second-order meta-analysis (Cooper & Koenka, 2012). However, until recently, no standard procedure with comparable rigor to first-order meta-analytical approaches had emerged. This paper makes use of the novel method for conducting second-order meta-analysis proposed by Schmidt and Oh (2013).

We contribute to the academic inquiry on the CSP-CFP relation in several regards. By summarizing the findings of existing meta-analyses and utilizing a data sample that is more than 25 times larger compared to the average of previous studies, we are able to generate fairly robust results. Not only do we demonstrate that the main findings of Orlitzky and colleagues still hold today, but our results deliver more unequivocal and comprehensive conclusions. The highly significant, positive, and bilateral CSP-CFP relation varies in magnitude depending on different CSP dimensions and CFP categories, but effect sizes are less variable than expected. Surprisingly, the relation is positive regardless of whether firms focus on ecological or social aspects, though corporate reputation turns out to be a key aspect. We highlight that a particularly strong CSP-CFP relation exists when operational CFP is considered. Furthermore, we conclude that shrinking CSP-CFP correlations in meta-analyses over time can be ascribed to more sophisticated research methods and are not observable at primary study level. Finally, we address potential biases resulting from the studies’ publishing source: we show that social issues-oriented and lower-impact journals as well as methodological weaker papers do not distort the CSP-CFP relation. The practical relevance of our second-order meta-analysis is: the business case for being a good firm is undeniable.

# Hypotheses

Theoretical arguments support a positive, negative, as well as neutral CSP-CFP relation. Arguments supporting a positive CSP-CFP relation are typically rooted in stakeholder theory (Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Freeman, 1984), the resource-based view (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984), institutional theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983), or draw on the industrial organization literature (Porter, 1979). When arguing for a negative CSP-CFP relation, scholars usually refer to Levitt’s (1958) or Friedman’s (1962, 1970) logic of social responsibility of the firm to solely increase its profits. Moreover, arguments based on portfolio theory (Markowitz, 1952, 1959) point towards disadvantageous limitations for portfolio construction when picking stocks following a CSP filter. Finally, proponents of the efficient market hypothesis (Fama, 1970, 1991) argue for a neutral – or at least non-exploitable – relation of CSP and CFP, as all information is priced at any time by the market. This also includes potentially business-relevant CSP information.

Next to these differing theoretical perspectives, the empirical CSP-CFP debate to date faces several questions. Even though considerable primary research has been conducted, it still remains less clear how different CSP dimensions and CFP categories interrelate and whether the business case holds as well for different measures of CFP. Eventually, questions of robustness and moderating effects arise which need to be answered in order to derive.

# Corporate social and financial performance

unequivocal conclusions regarding the CSP-CFP relation and its manifestations. This paper seeks to answer some of these questions.

# The general CSP-CFP Relation

# Direction of the CSP-CFP

In the academic literature, to date, the business case for CSP seems to be increasingly accepted and empirically supported (Carroll & Shabana, 2010; Eccles, Ioannou, & Serafeim, 2014; Flammer, 2015). In line with the outcomes of previous research that summarized large numbers of primary research (e.g. Endrikat, Guenther, & Hoppe, 2014; Margolis, Elfenbein, & Walsh, 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003) we, thus, propose:

H1a: CSP and CFP are generally positively related across a wide variety of study designs.

# Causality of the CSP-CFP Relation

Next to the general CSP-CFP relation, the subsequent question pertains to the causality of this relation. Proponents of good management theory (Waddock & Graves, 1997) argue that prior good CSP leads subsequently to better CFP. The opposite explanation is the slack resources theory (Cyert & March, 1963; J. B. McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988), where excess financial resources of a company are seen as a necessary condition in order to reinvest and, thus, counter threats or exploit opportunities (Daniel, Lohrke, Fornaciari, & Turner, 2004). Following this view, prior superior CFP leads subsequently to improved CSP. As both theories found theoretical and empirical support, a common argument is that there exists a virtuous circle between CSP and CFP – they seem to be related reciprocally and concurrently (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Hart & Ahuja, 1996; Waddock & Graves, 1997). We follow this line of thought and thus expect:

H1b: The causality of the CSP-CFP relation is bidirectional.

# The Relation of various CSP Dimensions and CFP

# Corporate Environmental Performance

Since the first review studies on the CSP-CFP relation (Aldag & Bartol, 1978; Arlow & Gannon, 1982), research has considered corporate environmental performance (CEP) as part of CSP. Orlitzky and Benjamin (2001) were the first to split the CSP construct and analyze CEP separately. These authors assume investors and consumers are less aware of the environmental performance of firms. In contrast, social aspects are more likely to be publicly communicated and, thus, reflected by stock- and stakeholders. Accordingly, the authors report a weaker CEP-CFP correlation compared to the overall sample. Orlitzky et al. (2003) reiterate the weak relation between CEP and CFP. Over the course of the years, individual meta-studies dedicated specifically to CEP and/or the social dimension of CSP were published. The summary effects for the CEP-CFP relation were often positive and significant (Albertini, 2013; Dixon-Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand, & Romi, 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014). However, the absolute level usually demonstrated lower correlation levels compared to studies purely focusing on social aspects (Combs, Liu, Hall, & Ketchen, 2006; Crook, Todd, Combs, Woehr, & Ketchen, 2011; Unger, Rauch, Frese, & Rosenbusch, 2011). In line with these findings, we expect:

H2a: The relation between CSP (excluding environmental aspects) and CFP is stronger than for CEP and CFP.

# CSP Reputation

Four CSP dimensions attracted the greatest interest among meta-researchers in the past: CSP reputation, CSP disclosure, CSP philanthropy, and CSP audits, processes, and policies. CSP reputation (Barnett, Jermier, & Lafferty, 2006) typically yields high correlations with CFP. The reason being that corporate reputation is of particular importance.

relevance or interest to a variety of external parties. For example, reputation is likely to influence customers’ behaviours and investors’ decisions (Orlitzky et al., 2003). This intangible character of corporate reputation, which is difficult to replicate, leads to sustained superior profit over time (P. W. Roberts & Dowling, 2002). Literature reviews and meta-analytical results point in a similar direction (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Sabate & Puente, 2003). We, thus, hypothesize that CSP reputation plays a dominant role:

# H2b:

Within the CSP dimensions, reputational aspects have the strongest relation to CFP.

# CSP Disclosure

A more controversial debate exists regarding the link between CSP disclosure and CFP. Wiseman (1982) finds considerable discrepancies between CSP disclosures and actual CSP. Ullmann (1985) concludes that voluntary disclosure should not be considered as a proxy for CSP performance. R. W. Roberts (1992) discovers that stakeholder power, philanthropic activities, and previous economic performance significantly explain concurrent CSP disclosure. Orlitzky et al. (2003) ascribe a minimal positive relation between CSP disclosure practices and CFP, whereas additionally almost all of the observed effect size variance is due to statistical artifacts. Research in environmental management also nourishes a weak relation among both measures. Schultze and Trommer (2012, p. 396) summarize, based on a review of empirical research, that ‘as disclosure is mostly voluntary, many companies only provide beneficial rather than accurate, unbiased information on their current performance’. This could lead, in turn, to distorted information of market participants accompanied by increased stock volatility when investors realize that their investment decisions were based on wrong assumptions (Orlitzky, 2013). Thus, we expect a relatively weaker link of CSP disclosure and CFP:

# H2c:

Within the CSP dimensions, CSP disclosure has the weakest relation to CFP.

# The Relation of CSP and various CFP Categories

# Perceptional CFP

Perceptual evaluations of business performance by senior executives are considered to be valid substitutes for objective CFP measures. The product–moment correlation coefficient between subjective and objective measures ranges in empirical studies between 0.4 and 0.8 (Guthrie, 2001; Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1987; Wall et al., 2004). Despite managers’ discretionary assessment of the firm performance, the judgment is often a fair reflection of financial reality and not per se overrated (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1987). Depending on the research context, the application of survey-based measures can even be the preferred choice of researchers. A quarter of empirical studies in top management journals therefore use some kind of subjective organizational performance measure (P. J. Richard, Devinney, Yip, & Johnson, 2009). Perceptual CFP measures are compiled by one-fifth of the meta-studies in our sample. We formulate our hypothesis in accordance with meta-analyses that report high correlations between CSP and perceptual CFP measures (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wu, 2006):

# H3a:

CSP has the strongest relation to perceptional CFP than to other CFP categories.

# Operational CFP

Operational performance such as productivity allows a nuanced conceptualization of business performance as it focuses on those operational success factors that might lead to superior CFP (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986). As an intermediate-outcome metric (Peloza, 2009), it reflects information that is closer to the value creation process within a firm and more remote to the variety of interacting and overlapping factors like discretionary accounting practices or general stock market movements (P. J. Richard et al., 2009). McWilliams, Siegel, and Teoh (1999) caution not to use share prices as a sole metric for CFP when investigating the CSP-CFP relation. Effects of specific plant or product-level information on value creation cannot be fully captured by simply looking at market-based.

measures such as shareholder value. Therefore, the effects of CSP on operational CFP measures should be less likely to be drowned out by capital market ‘noise’ (Peloza, 2009, p. 1527). Empirical evidence for this argument was found in a meta-analysis on human resource factors (Combs et al., 2006): operational CFP measures such as staff turnover yield higher correlations than other accounting- or market-based performance categories. Similar results were carried out in the environmental supply chain context: operational CFP measures such as reduced material and waste streams demonstrated slightly higher correlations to market-based measures (Golicic & Smith, 2013). Thus, we hypothesize:

# H3b: CSP has a stronger relation to operational CFP than to market-based CFP.

# Traditional CFP Categories

When considering the range of the traditional CFP measures, Cochran and Wood (1984) propose that accounting-based CFP such as return on assets may be the best proxy for measuring CFP – presuming that the accounting practices of firms are comparable. They more adequately reflect internal decision-making capabilities and managerial performance rather than external evaluations of investors. Empirical evidence supports this: accounting-based CFP measures have a stronger relation to CSP than market-based CFP measures (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wu, 2006).

Growth-based CFP – typically determined by sales, profit, or employee growth – is not directly affected by capital market developments. However, companies’ growth can be distorted by inorganic growth from acquisitions or divestments. Such activities usually have a relatively higher impact on growth measures (O’Shaughnessy & Flanagan, 1998) compared to changes in accounting figures (King, Dalton, Daily, & Covin, 2004). Accordingly, empirical research finds a weaker CFP relation for growth as a CFP measure compared to accounting-based CFP (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2013; Unger et al., 2011).

With regards to risk, primary research (Bansal & Clelland, 2004; Godfrey, Merrill, & Hansen, 2009; J. B. McGuire et al., 1988) suggests that CSP reduces companies’ risk. Most of the empirical studies measure risk either as accounting-based risk (i.e. debt to assets) or market-based risk (i.e. beta-factor, total volatility). However, the observed correlations in meta-analyses are relatively low (e.g. Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). Summing up, these arguments bring us to the following hypothesis:

# H3c: Accounting-based CFP demonstrates a stronger relation to CSP than growth-, risk-, and market-based CFP.

# Mutual Funds

Several studies on mutual funds, financial indices, and virtual portfolios suggest that the positive CSP-CFP relation is weaker compared to studies using firm-specific CFP measures. To date, this result presents a puzzling outcome in CSP-CFP research. The first mutual funds studies appeared in the early 1990s. The initial findings of these early studies discovered that the performance of CSP-oriented mutual funds is not statistically different from the performance of conventional mutual funds (e.g. Hamilton, Jo, & Statman, 1993). However, ever since then, further investigations have been carried out in several primary and review studies (Bauer, Koedijk, & Otten, 2005; Capelle-Blancard & Monjon, 2014; Rathner, 2013; Revelli & Viviani, 2015), hardening the conclusion that the CSP-CFP link is weaker for mutual funds as compared to other CSP-CFP studies. In turn, we hypothesize:

# H3d: Studies on mutual funds demonstrate a weaker CSP-CFP relation compared to studies using other CFP measures.

# Moderating Factors

The literature discusses a range of conditions under which CSP and CFP influence each other (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). In addition to the most common factors – company size and the type of industry.

(Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Buehler & Shetty, 1974; Griffin & Mahon, 1997; Orlitzky, 2008) – several other moderating factors have been used in primary studies. These are visibility to the public and consumers (Fry, Keim, & Meiners, 1982; Jiang & Bansal, 2003), research and development investments (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000), economic conditions (Golicic & Smith, 2013), the level of diversification, advertising, government sales, consumer income, and stage in the industry as well as the firm life cycle (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Elsayed & Paton, 2009; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Since not all primary studies use the same bundle of control variables and/or moderating factors, it is difficult to compare such effects in meta-analyses. Thus, as meta-analysts have not adjusted for these factors in a comparable manner, we also cannot investigate these effects. Nonetheless, a few central moderating factors can be assessed at second-order level.

# Effects over Time

It is not unusual that academic studies investigating a specific effect for the first time demonstrate impressive effect sizes which partly diminish in subsequent research studies (Trikalinos & Ioannidis, 2005). Griffin and Mahon (1997) have already called for research that looks at the CSP-CFP relation over time. To date, it is still an open question as to whether this is a time-independent relation. Scholars suggest that institutional investors increasingly focus on stakeholder issues (Borgers et al., 2013; Derwall et al., 2011). On account of learning effects and changes in investor values, these issues came into focus in recent years and subsequently the CSP-CFP relation – in this case measured as market-based CFP – diminished considerably since the mid-2000s. However, in meta-research on the CSP-CFP link, the evidence of a time dependency is not consistent. In their meta-analysis, Pavie and Filho (2008) show considerable effect size differences before and after 1998. Some discover no or only non-significant relations (Albertini, 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014; Rubera & Kirca, 2012). Based on suggestions from primary studies and meta-analyses, we hypothesize about the moderating role of time:

H4a: The CSP-CFP relation shrinks over time.

# Sample Size

Hedges (1981) demonstrates that effect sizes for small samples are biased upward. Evidence from cumulative meta-analyses in different fields supports this finding and cautions that meta-analyses with a small number of subjects may overestimate effects (Ioannidis, Trikalinos, Ntzani, & Contopoulos-Ioannidis, 2003; Trikalinos et al., 2004). By using the number of included studies as a weighting factor, the calculation design of meta-analyses seeks to adjust for this circumstance. If the CSP-CFP relation was a statistical outlier, we would observe effect size differences depending on the study sample size. Initial observations of our sample based on the number of included primary studies in a meta-analysis and the corresponding meta-study overall effect size support such a conclusion. We therefore hypothesize:

H4b: The CSP-CFP relation shrinks with the growing number of primary studies in the meta-sample.

# The Role of the Studies’ Publishing Source

Orlitzky (2011) examines in a review of the 2003 data whether the empirical evidence on the CSP-CFP relation differs depending on the kind of publishing journal. The author finds that the average correlations in economics, finance, and accounting journals are less than half of the correlations published in social issues-oriented journals (SIM journals – social issues in management). The deviation is statistically significant. Allouche and Laroche (2005) reflect on their meta-analysis results by differentiating the publishing sources – business ethics journals, accounting journals, and management journals. They find no significant differences. In order to investigate the role of the publishing source for our sample, we follow a three-step approach. First, we differentiate between SIM and general management (GM) journals, similarly to Orlitzky (2011). Second, we classify the journals of our 25 meta-analyses according to the Thomson Reuters’ Journal Citation Reports (JCR) classification standard [Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) subject categories]. Third, we take into consideration the JCR journal impact factor of the publishing journals for the meta-analyses in our sample. We expect that effect sizes will tend to be smaller in more rigorous journals (e.g. Aguinis, Beaty, Boik, & Pierce, 2005). We, thus, hypothesize:

DOI: 10.1002/csr

# Corporate social and financial performance

H4c: The CSP-CFP relation is distorted by the publication source; SIM and lower-impact journals report more positive outcomes.

# Methodological Quality

An analysis of meta-analyses in education research proposes that ‘there seems to be a particular tendency for smaller effect sizes to be associated with higher methodological quality’ (Tamim, Bernard, Borokhovski, Abrami, & Schmid, 2011, p. 14). However, the results were not significant. Based on nearly 200 meta-studies in management research, Aguinis, Dalton, Bosco, Pierce, and Dalton (2011) find that methodological choices have very little impact on the overall effect sizes. Lipsey and Wilson (1993) reveal for 302 studies in psychology that effect sizes in meta-studies are not inflated by the inclusion of methodological weak studies. To create generalizable conclusions for the CSP-CFP debate, we build on Aguinis et al. (2011) and apply a methodological strength assessment. We hypothesize:

H4d: The CSP-CFP relation is independent of methodological choices.

# Methods and Data

The first comprehensive summary of meta-analyses was published at the beginning of the 1990s, aggregating the work of 302 meta-analyses (Lipsey & Wilson, 1993). Ever since then, various examples of how to aggregate existing research summaries have emerged (Ahn, Ames, & Myers, 2012; Aytug, Rothstein, Zhou, & Kern, 2012; Cooper & Koenka, 2012; Hattie, 2009; Peterson, 2001; D. Richard, Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003; Tamim et al., 2011; Wilson & Lipsey, 2001). The main challenges of second-order meta-analyses are the precise calculation of the second-order average effect and estimation of its sampling error. Hunter and Schmidt (2004) and Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, and Rothstein (2009) already address these challenges, but only recently have sufficient statistical methods been provided.

This study uses Schmidt and Oh’s (2013) method for second-order meta-analysis. A second-order meta-analysis combines a number of independent but methodologically comparable first-order meta-analyses. It enables better generalization across contexts with a tremendously larger sample size and enhanced meta-analytic moderating factor analyses. Conclusions can be derived not just from a fraction of available primary studies, but presumably with a sample close to a complete set of studies. The Schmidt and Oh (2013) second-order meta-analysis is an advancement of the psychometric first-order predecessor – the Hunter-Schmidt (2004), approach, which is used by more than 80% of meta-analyses in management research (Aguinis et al., 2011).

Schmidt and Oh’s (2013) method has two important advantages compared to other second-level meta-analytic approaches. First, their method determines how much variance across a set of comparable first-order meta-analyses is due to second-order sampling error. This can considerably reduce the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta-analyses and allows estimation of the true (non-artifactual) variance across these mean effect sizes. Second, the analysis enables the computation of reliability estimates for the first-order meta-analyses and, thus, allows us to produce a more accurate estimation of the true mean effect size in each first-order meta-analysis.

Schmidt and Oh (2013) present three approaches for second-order meta-analysis: bare-bones second-order meta-analysis; psychometric second-order meta-analysis with artifact distribution of first-order meta-analysis estimates; and psychometric second-order meta-analysis with individual corrected first-order meta-analysis estimates. Because of the high number of first-order meta-analyses in our sample using artifact distribution correction without correcting primary studies individually, we opted for the first two approaches to calculate our results. Both approaches vary in terms of the input data (uncorrected or attenuated correlations vis-à-vis corrected or disattenuated correlations), the weighting scheme of the first-order meta-analyses, and the calculation of the second-order mean effect size.1

1See Table 1 in Schmidt and Oh (2013, p. 210) for a technical summary of the three approaches.

Like the first-order meta-analytical predecessor methodology (Hunter et al., 1982; Hunter & Schmidt, 2004), second-order meta-analysis is also a fully random effect model.

# The Search Process

We included a CSP-CFP meta-analysis in our sample insofar the applied CSP definition of meta-analysis matched the CSP understanding expressed by Wood (2010) and Clarkson (1995). Wood (2010, p. 64) argued for ‘CSP as an overarching, multi-dimensional construct’ where vast literature on organizational culture, managerial decision-making, or employee relations practices ‘waits to be brought into the field of CSP’. Also, Clarkson (1995) outlined a diverse set of social and stakeholder issues. He included, for example, employee-related aspects like compensation/rewards, training and development, employment equity, and employee communication. We follow their line of reasoning and have also included meta-analyses beyond a narrow CSP focus. These are, for instance, CEP, ethical corporate governance, and broader employee-related aspects. We did not differentiate as to whether the motives for firm CSP were altruistic or strategic (Baron, 2001; J. W. McGuire, 1969; McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006). In terms of CFP, the studies needed to consider at least one of the following categories: accounting-based performance, market-based performance, operational performance, perceptual performance, growth metrics, risk, or the performance of CSP mutual funds/indices. In cases where the entire meta-analysis was beyond this scope, we extracted only the relevant parts of the whole analysis. Meta-analyses with probit- or logit-correlations were excluded, as transformations to the r-family of correlations result in effect sizes with too large sampling errors. Non-standardized effects, which could not be classified as CSP-CFP sub-effects, were also disregarded for this second-order meta-analysis. Our cut-off date for study inclusion was December 2014. All studies needed to be available in electronic format.

Initially, we applied ancestry research, using widely cited meta- and review studies to extract their cited predecessor studies. The sample was subsequently extended with a forward search in Google Scholar looking for potentially relevant cross-references of so far unknown studies. After that, we performed searches in relevant databases and publisher sites: Academy of Management journals, ABI/Inform, Ebsco, Emerald, Google Scholar, Oxford Journals, Sage, Science Direct, Springer Link, Web of Science, and Wiley, and also searched for non-published manuscripts on Econbiz, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), Research Papers in Economics (RePEc), and Social Science Research Network (SSRN). We used several search combinations and variations of the term ‘Corporate Social Performance’ including (corporate) sustainability, (corporate) social responsibility, (corporate) governance, (corporate) environmental performance – all in relation to (corporate) financial performance. Of all database queries, we further processed the first 100 hits sorted by relevance. The raw data set of several thousand studies was first reduced for overlapping search hits, and second searched for keywords in the remaining results. We searched for meta, review, literature, overview, analysis, study/ies, and examination. This yielded an overall raw sample of 149 working papers and studies which were analyzed in more detail by examining the abstract or full paper. Seventy-six studies were dropped in the next step, because they either did not contain a relevant CSP-CFP categorization or were single-study designs. The remaining studies were narrowed to the final sample of 25 studies by the exclusion of: (1) 47 narrative reviews and vote-count studies; and (2) meta-studies with non-transferable effect sizes and different paper versions. If different versions of meta-studies with comparable data sets were identified, the latest version remained in our sample. Our search was open to meta-analyses in all asset classes, but it was not possible to locate meta-studies that analyzed other objects than equities. Thus, published (primary) research of the CSP effect in corporate bonds, real estate, and private equity is not considered, as we could not yet identify dedicated meta-analyses.

# Sample

Our total sample consists of 25 meta-analyses which combined yield a gross number (n m) of 1,902 primary studies. It aggregates 4,507 separate effects (k m) and nearly a million observations (N m = 992,239) (Table 1). Apart from the meta-analytical summary effects, we obtained 129 CSP-CFP sub-effects of first-order meta-analyses, combining in total 2,387,215 observations. Besides the summary and sub-effects at the meta-level, we extracted all provided data at primary study level. Adjusted for overlapping studies and primary studies which either were not made.

transparent by the meta-analyses’ authors (n = 404) or needed manual corrections (n = 38), the final study sample comprises 1214 (n) unique studies. Manual corrections were necessary for author typing errors, different years (i.e. published vs unpublished version), or adding or changing ‘a’ or ‘b’ when two different studies of the same author team appeared in the same year. When retrieving the primary study information from the meta-studies, we coded it in a unique form as author1, author2, …, author i (year). For 45% of studies (n(1) = 551 primary studies), the first-order meta-analyses provided data about effect sizes. On the basis of this information, it was possible to calculate a conventional first-order meta-analysis (so-called second-order omnibus meta-analysis).

# Coding

Besides the basic identifier information: (1) we retrieved a variety of methodological information. This included the meta-analytical approach, the family of reported effect sizes, if and how corrections for sampling and measurement error were taken, and, finally which attenuation factors were used. (2) We collected the granularity of primary studies (transparency level of statistics, all effect sizes, N, k, and t-test). (3) Finally, we gathered all meta-analytical results for summary and sub-effects (effect sizes, attenuated and disattenuated variances, standard errors, credibility and confidence intervals, reliability information of dependent and independent variables, the overall reliability estimate, and results of the homogeneity test, significance tests, and Fail-Safe N analysis). If results for both fixed and random effects were reported, we selected the random effect. All transparent data in primary studies which were also included in a first-order meta-analysis were extracted (e.g. the study identifier and results like study size, effect size(s), and reliabilities). In some cases, rudimentary interpretation was needed. For these cases, two independent coders reviewed the context. The original inter-rater reliability was above 0.9.

# Independence Considerations

An important prerequisite for conducting a second-order meta-analysis is statistical independence of individual first-order meta-analyses. This would require that the primary studies or samples used in one first-order meta-analysis not be included in any of the other analyses (Schmidt & Oh, 2013). In fact, it is a typical case for second-order meta-analyses that this assumption cannot completely be met. Scholars therefore suggest that minimizing the lack of independence might be the best that can be expected (Cooper & Koenka, 2012; Schmidt & Oh, 2013). Various simulation analyses support this approach and find negligible effects of statistical independence violations (Bijmolt & Pieters, 2001; Romano & Kromrey, 2008; Tracz, Elmore, & Pohlmann, 1992).

Our approach for minimizing data dependency applied three steps: meta-analyses selection; average overlap assessment; and the elimination of overlapping studies as a robustness check. First, we selected only the most recent version of a study. We considered multiple contributions from single authors only if they had different research topics or reported different correlation coefficients for the same primary study (Orlitzky, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). Second, we calculated for every meta-analysis with transparent primary studies the pair-wise overlap to each other. We determined an average overlap of 5.4% of one single meta-analysis to the rest with 78% of pairs having less than 5% overlap. Third, Wilson and Lipsey (2001) reduce disproportionate dependency in second-order meta-analysis by eliminating studies that have more than 25% primary studies in common with other meta-analyses. Thus, we eliminated all meta-analyses with more than 25% overlap to at least one other study. The results of an additional assessment to rule out distorting effects of a potential independence violation are reported in Table 6. We conclude that the level of average non-independence for this study appears small and we have no indication that it could distort effect sizes and variances significantly.

# Analysis and Statistical Models

We calculated summary effects in three alternative ways and also for various subgroups and moderating factors. First, we conducted a second-order omnibus meta-analysis with all primary studies in our meta-analyses sample which contained transparent data for effect sizes. Technically, this is a traditional psychometric first-order.

meta-analysis (Hunter et al., 1982; Schmidt & Hunter, 2015). So-called omnibus meta-analyses have the advantage of established calculation procedures from first-order meta-analysis. Moreover, such analyses yield the same grand mean estimate, provided that all else is equal. But they also suffer from shortcomings like typically scarce data transparency at primary study level and, most important, it is not possible to estimate second-order sampling error variance and correct for it (Schmidt & Oh, 2013). This omnibus meta-analysis, to our knowledge, constitutes the largest meta-analysis in the field hitherto, based on the number of included primary studies. It combines n (1) = 551 studies with N (1) = 152,437 observations retrieved from previous meta-analyses. We utilized this first-order meta-analysis to gain a more granular understanding of the CSP-CFP relation and its statistical variation at primary study level.

Second, we calculated a second-order meta-analysis combining all meta-analytical summary effects of the 25 meta-analyses in our sample (m = 25).

Third, we aggregated all relevant sub-effects of these meta-analyses (m = 129) in various subgroups in order to derive more granular conclusions about the CSP-CFP relation. These sub-effects and their reliability measures provided the foundation for the calculation and correction of a second-order sampling error and the subsequent moderating factor analysis. Moreover, as part of the robustness checks, we analyzed the impact on results when changing from best-effort variances to simple variance estimates. Further documentation on the determination of effect sizes and variances, the correction for measurement error, and the assessment of heterogeneity is provided in online Supplementary Appendix SA.

# Adjusting for the Second-Order Sampling Error

The second-order sampling error is comparable to adjustments for first-order measurement error variance in psychometric meta-analysis. As measurement error is the random deviation of an observed score from a true score, so is the random deviation of first-order meta-effect sizes from its actual second-order average, the second-order sampling error. Thus, the function is comparable to measurement error (Schmidt & Oh, 2013):

bir = rpp bp̿

pi b + pb̿

where pir is the second-order sampling error adjusted for the i-th first-order meta-analytic estimate and unreliability in the first-order meta-analytic results, rpp is the reliability of i first-order meta-analytic values, pi is the i-th first-order meta-analytic estimate, and pb̿ is the second-order grand mean meta-analytic estimate. The reliability coefficient rpp is 1-ProVar, which is calculated as the ratio of b2/S2p σp where b2 σp is the estimate of the actual (non-artifactual) variance across the m-meta-analyses of the population mean-disattenuated correlations. This is the variance that remains after the variance for the second-order sampling error has been subtracted from the variance of mean-disattenuated correlations across the m-meta-analyses (Schmidt & Oh, 2013).

Adjustments for second-order sampling error are useful to reduce the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta-analyses and therefore produce more accurate estimations of the true mean effect size and (non-artifactual) variance in first-order meta-analyses. These figures are displayed in columns 6–13 of Table 4.

# Moderating Factors

For determining potential moderating factors, the data were split into two or, if necessary, into multiple subgroups. We calculated z-values to identify whether effect size differences among groups are significant. For assessing the potential time dependence of the CSP-CFP relation, we analyzed the effect sizes in dependence of the meta-study publication year and the average publication year of the primary study in each meta-analysis. To rule out a distortion.

of results from changing meta-analytic methods and correction factors over time, the relation was as well assessed on first-order level and in dependency of the publication year.

The number of primary studies in each meta-analysis and its repercussions for the correlation level were analyzed for evaluating the role of sample sizes. The influence of the publishing source was compared for SIM journals versus General Management (GM) journals based on Orlitzky’s (2011) categorization. Since definitions regarding what can be considered as a SIM or GM journal differ (AoM SIM Division, 2012), all publishing journals of the 25 meta-analyses were classified according to the Thomson Reuters’ JCR classification standard. The SSCI subject categories present in our sample (business, environmental studies, ethics, management, political science, and applied psychology) were used to alternatively differentiate the sample of meta-analyses. If a journal was listed in more than one SSCI category, the one where it ranks highest was selected. Furthermore, the JCR 5-Year Journal Impact Factors (2014), the annual citation frequency of the meta-analyses, and the deviation between working papers and published studies were evaluated.

Finally, effect size dependence on methodological quality was evaluated. The methodology quality assessment builds on Aguinis et al. (2011) and transferred those parts of Aguinis et al.’s 21 parameters which could be expressed as dichotomous and qualitative. All parameters which were applied multiple times (e.g. range restrictions) are summarized to one overarching parameter. For each of the parameter identifiable in a meta-study, the meta-study received a score of 1 (present) or 0 (not present). The condensed set contained 11 parameters and therefore yielded a maximum methodological quality score of 11. The total scores for the set of 25 meta-analyses range between 2 and 9.

# Addressing Publication Bias

A general concern of any meta-analysis is that research yielding no significant results remains unpublished (e.g. Dickersin, 2005). Rosenthal (1979) labelled this potential limitation as the file drawer problem, with reference to the many files that remain with the investigator and are not published by journals. We addressed this potential drawback by calculating the Fail-Safe N (or file drawer) statistic, a display of the Funnel Plot, and the inclusion of unpublished literature. Fail-Safe N states the number of (future) studies with null results, until the effect size loses its significance level (Rosenthal, 1979). Rosenthal suggested a tolerance level of 5n+10 for Fail-Safe N to be considered unlikely. The statistic was calculated for all summary and sub-effects. For a visual investigation of publication bias we included as well a funnel plot (Light & Pillemer, 1984; Sutton, 2009). It scatters the study size of a meta-analysis against the effect size. In our case the funnel plot displays all m = 129 sub-effects (number of effects k) against its disattenuated effect size p (Figure 1). The effects are symmetrically distributed around the underlying true effect, with larger variability for smaller studies (and vice versa). As such, we can exclude biases in the data. Furthermore, we applied the Egger test for publication bias, which tests for asymmetry of the funnel plot (Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997). Moreover, we separated attenuated and disattenuated effects from unpublished studies and subgroup the results against published studies (Schmidt & Hunter, 2015). The proportion of these working papers within the total results was notably high. They contributed 28 of the 129 sub-effects. All checks revealed that the results are very likely not be affected by publication bias (Figure 1; Table 5).

# Robustness Checks

The empirical outcomes of this analysis can be considered as fairly robust for a number of reasons. First, we analyzed the impact of switching from our best-effort variances to simple variance estimates (calculation according to Equation 6 in Online Supplement). The results in Table 6 show that our best-effort variances are conservative estimates, which produce lower effect sizes and variances, in particular for disattenuated results. Second, we performed a sensitivity analysis (Aguinis, Gottfredson, & Joo, 2013; Greenhouse & Iyengar, 2009) and recalculated all effects when leaving out the top 5% and bottom 5%, each for effect size and effect size variances. Third, to control for a potential bias through perceptual measures of CFP and CSP, the effects were recalculated by leaving out the complete sample of perceptual CFP and reputational CSP. The results of all three robustness checks indicate that the findings are not distorted by outliers (Table 6).

Figure 1. Funnel plot of meta-analyses’ sub-effects (m = 129) against disattenuated effect size.
Note: Figure 1 scatters the study size of the 129 meta-analysis sub-effects (number of effects k) against its disattenuated effect size p. Effects of published and unpublished studies are displayed separately. The intersection of the axes was moved to the simple average of disattenuated effect sizes (0.179). The effects are relatively symmetrically distributed around the average effect, with larger variability for smaller studies (and vice versa). The larger the number of effects k, the closer the effect sizes are expected to be around the population mean. Effect sizes of unpublished research do not indicate any suppression of unfavourable studies. Apart from a very few outliers, which are additionally accounted for in the Robustness Checks section, the sample is not distorted by publication bias. This visually derived conclusion is supported by the Egger test (Egger et al., 1997) with a calculated p-value for bias of 0.489. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

# Results

# The General CSP-CFP Relation

We find strong support for Hypothesis 1a. First, the second-order omnibus meta-analysis, which is technically a first-order meta-analysis with n (1) = 551 primary studies, reveals a highly significant (first-order) effect size of ð = 0.119 (Table 2). This number presents the weighted average correlation across all primary studies adjusted for sampling error. When we additionally adjust for meta-analytic artifacts (measurement error for the CSP and CFP figures), we find a disattenuated correlation of p = 0.169. The average effect is highly significant and different from zero. The 95% confidence intervals for this weighted average attenuated correlation range from 0.105 to 0.134 (0.150 to 0.189 for the disattenuated). The 95% credibility interval ranges from -0.206 to 0.444 (-0.284 to 0.624 for the disattenuated). The corresponding variance σ²p of 0.054 (Table 2) is fairly comparable to the simple average of

T. Busch and G. Friede disattenuated correlations in the meta-analyses in our sample of 0.042 (Table 1). The effects are very heterogeneous [Q(1) = 4733 to 9288 and I2 = 0.88 to 0.94].

Second, the aggregation of all summary effects of the meta-analyses in our sample (m = 25) uncovers effect sizes that are very similar to those in the sample of primary studies. We determine an attenuated correlation of r̿ = 0.108 and a disattenuated correlation of pb̿ = 0.150 (Table 3).

Third, the correlations change marginally when the sample of 129 sub-effects from the meta-analyses is aggregated (r̿ = 0.110, pb̿ = 0.157). But unlike effect sizes, (true) variances at second-order level are considerably lower compared to those in the omnibus analysis of primary studies. Second-level variances are only in the range of σb²r̿ = 0.001 to b2b̿ = 0.007 (Table 3). The 95% credibility interval for disattenuated sub-effects ranges from -0.001σp to 0.316. Moreover, in our second-order results, we cannot detect the large heterogeneity of effects anymore that was present in the primary studies. Q and I2 indicate homogeneous relations (Q = 11.4 to 75.5; I2 = 0.00; Table 3).

The third and preferred measure of heterogeneity for psychometric meta-analysis (1-ProVar) still indicates heterogeneity (0.96 to 0.97) – albeit in very small variances, which have low statistical power.

We conclude that all CSP-CFP summary effects, be it first or second order, are highly significant positive. Second-order level variances are furthermore very small with credibility intervals that only by a very thin margin include zero and with effect sizes that are relatively homogeneous.

With respect to Hypothesis 1b, the difference between prior CSP to subsequent CFP (ri = 0.090) vs prior CFP to subsequent CSP (r = 0.098) is small and non-significant (Table 4). We apply two layers of corrections to account for other artifacts besides first-order sampling error. Based on the first-order correction for other artifacts, the relation changes slightly (pbi = 0.128 vs pbi = 0.141). The additional correction for second-order sampling error reveals that the real grand mean correlation is marginally different (pbir = 0.130 vs pbir = 0.143). The difference between both groups fails, with a wide margin, any significance level. We, thus, can rule out that the slack resources hypothesis or the good management hypothesis yields significantly higher results. However, we find the strongest correlation for concurrent CSP and CFP, which supports Hypothesis 1b that there is a virtuous circle between CSP and CFP. The mean correlation for concurrent CSP and CFP, corrected for second-order sampling error, is pbir = 0.159, the highest of the group with the lowest variance.

# The Relation of Various CSP Dimensions and CFP

In line with Hypothesis 2a, we find that studies with social CSP reveal a higher relation (pb i focusing on environmental CSP (pb i = 0.151) (Table 4). However, this difference is small and fails statistical significance (p-value of the difference is 0.388). Thus, Hypothesis 2a is rejected. Opposite to a common notion in the literature, our findings propose that good CSP pays, whether social or environmental related.

Within CSP dimensions, CSP reputation yields the highest relation (pb i = 0.318). The difference to the group average of CSP measures of b̿p = 0.225 is significantly higher at the 99% level (z-value 2.66). However, when we adjust for the 0.80 reliability factor (Table 4, column 12), CSP reputation is marginally adjusted towards pbir = 0.299 to account for the second-order sampling error. Thus, we confirm Hypothesis 2b: reputational aspects have the strongest relation to CFP within the CSP dimensions.

CSP disclosure yields significantly lower correlations (pb i = 0.119) compared to the group average (b̿p = 0.225) at the 99% level (Table 4). On account of the high level of variance artifacts (1-ProVar = 0.58), an adjustment for the second-order sampling error reveals the final, potentially true, correlation level birp supported. Within CSP dimensions, CSP disclosure has the weakest relation to CFP, including second-order sampling error.

# The Relation of CSP and Various CFP Categories

In line with Hypothesis 3a, perceptual performance yields – indeed, by some distance – the highest relation to CFP (pb i = 0.380) (Table 4). It deviates significantly at the 99% level from the CFP group average (p = 0.148), also adjusted for second-order sampling error (pb ir = 0.359). This finding clearly supports Hypothesis 3a: CSP has the strongest link to perceptional CFP than to other CFP categories.

Operational CFP exhibits the highest CSP-CFP relation within the group of objective CFP categories (pbi = 0.222) (Table 4). The deviation with the group average (b̿p = 0.148) is highly significant. Consideration of the second-order sampling error changes the result only negligibly (pb ir = 0.216). This clearly supports Hypothesis 3b.

Accounting-based measures of CFP are more highly correlated (pbi = 0.161) with CSP compared to other market-based measures: growth measures (pbi = 0.124), market-based CFP measures (pb i = 0.115), and risk measures (pb i = 0.062). Even though all these category results are significantly different from zero, market-based CFP and risk measures return significantly lower correlations compared to other CFP measures (Table 4). These findings support Hypothesis 3c.

In accordance with Hypothesis 3d, we obtain the lowest correlation of all CFP categories (b = 0.016) for CSP mutual funds. It is the only result within the CFP categories which is not significantly different from zero. Nonetheless, if we adjust for the low statistical reliability of the CSP mutual fund relation (1-ProVar = 0.00), a correction for the second-order sampling error towards the average group effect b̿p becomes necessary (outlined in Equation 1). The difference between pb i and pb ir of 0.132 could be a reflection of the overall ‘noise’ – whether statistically or capital markets induced. We, thus, support Hypothesis 3d and conclude that mutual funds demonstrate a weaker CSP-CFP relation compared to other CFP categories. Figure 2 graphically summarizes the range and magnitude of the main effect sizes.

# Moderating Factors

Our initial assessment reveals that meta-analyses which are more recent have significantly lower effect sizes compared to older studies. Measured by either the meta-study publication year (pbi = 0.130 vs pbi = 0.216) or the average.

For the purpose of this second-order meta-analysis, we changed the algebraic sign for CFP risk for calculation reasons. The stated positive CSP/CFP risk correlation means in fact a reduced CFP risk with increased CSP.

Note: Unless otherwise stated, the subgroup H1 represents results greater than the respective average of the selected moderating factor. H2 represents the subgroup below the subgroup average. z ri and z pb i are the corresponding z-values for the subgroup means. The additional index (1) indicates the first-order level. See text for abbreviations. The significance values are: *p &lt; 0.10; **p &lt; 0.05; and ***p &lt; 0.01.

publication year of the primary studies in each meta-analysis (pb i = 0.132 vs pbi = 0.194), the results indicate that meta-analyses which are more recent have significantly lower effect sizes (Table 5). However, the attenuation factors applied by the first-order meta-analytical reviewers for these two groups differ considerably. Relatively older meta-analyses used on average an attenuation factor of 0.66 in comparison to younger analyses (0.78). We also assess the relation on first-order level with data on 551 primary studies to rule out a distortion of initial results from changing meta-analytical methods and correction factors over time. This verification uncovers that the pattern of a correlation-level shrink is no longer observable as the differences in r 1 ð ) and p( ) do not exist anymore (0.002 and b 1 -0.002). Based on this extensive set of primary studies that avoids potential distortions through different meta-analytical attenuation factors, Hypothesis 4a cannot be confirmed.

When separating our meta-analytical results into dichotomous groups depending on the number of underlying studies (n), we retrieve two summary effects that are marginally and insignificantly different from each other. Larger studies tend to be negligibly weaker in effect size (pb i = 0.153) in comparison to smaller studies (pbi = 0.160). We conclude that the CSP-CFP relation is not dependent on the study sample size as the difference is non-significant. Larger studies in our sample produce equally strong relations compared to smaller samples which can be interpreted as another sign of the stability of the CSP-CFP relation. Thus, we reject Hypothesis 4b.

As no meta-study in our sample was published in an economics, finance, or accounting journal, we are limited to sub-effects in SIM journals and GM journals. We determine, in contrast to findings at primary study level, even significant lower effect sizes of meta-analyses in SIM journals (p = 0.115) compared to GM journals (pb i = 0.174). These are interesting findings since prior research proposed the opposite. Working paper studies exhibit attenuated effect sizes comparable with those in published papers (r i = 0.115) but disattenuated effect sizes deviate significantly from those in published papers (pbi = 0.186 vs 0.152). Moreover, we find that higher-impact factor journals (factor 5.1 on average for the sample) produce significantly higher correlations than lower-impact factor journals (pb i = 0.177 vs pbi = 0.127).

frequently cited (per annum basis) meta-analyses exhibit very similar effect sizes compared to less often-cited ones. All these findings clearly reject Hypothesis 4c. There is no upwardly distorted CSP-CFP relation through SIM or lower-impact journals.

Finally, regarding the role of judgmental decisions in meta-analyses techniques and methodological choices, we find virtually no difference in effect sizes for methodological stronger (pb i = 0.161) and weaker studies (pb i = 0.153). This finding supports Hypothesis 4d. The CSP-CFP relation exists regardless of the methodological sophistication in meta-analyses. Furthermore, the results of the additional robustness tests suggest that the results are not distorted by statistical outliers (Table 6).

# Discussion and Conclusion

This study makes several contributions to the academic inquiry on whether it pays to be a good firm. First, we are able to claim with more confidence than before that a highly significant, positive, and bidirectional CSP-CFP relation exists. The findings are robust at first-order and, in particular, at second-order meta-analytical level and do not change when we consider potential publication bias, apply less conservative variances, or conduct sensitivity analyses. True variances at second-order level are considerably lower compared to those at first-order level. Thus, the resulting credibility interval is much narrower, with a lower bound virtually at zero (m = 129). We are therefore safely able to claim that in 95% of cases we observe a positive average effect in meta-studies on the CSP-CFP relation. We find no indication that either CSP or CFP matters more from a cause–effect point of view. All three underlying theories (slack resources, good management, and virtuous circle) can empirically be defended. However, the level of effect sizes for a bidirectional relation is highest at the lowest variability of the effects. This leads us to acknowledge the virtuous circle theory as the most probable. To date, the academic CSP-CFP debate is often coined by the notions of ‘contradictory’, ‘mixed’, or ‘ambiguous’ findings. We propose that the business case for CSP can be considered well proved. Research designs taking into account non-linear CSP-CFP relations may even further increase the explanatory power of the CSP-CFP relation (Barnett & Salomon, 2012; Gao, Wu, & Hafsi, 2017; Trumpp & Guenther, 2017; Wagner, Van Phu, Azomahou, & Wehrmeyer, 2002).

Second, we shed light on an academically well-established misinterpretation. We cannot detect statistically significant differences between the effects of environmental and social-related CSP on CFP. This outcome is in contrast to several empirical studies and conceptions which consider social aspects as the main driver for CFP. Our findings propose a different result: good CSP pays off, whether social or environmental related. The difference between both is not statistically significant. This result mirrors S. L. Hart’s (1995) idea of a natural resource-based view and supports other empiric evidence for the business case of improving CEP (Albertini, 2013; Berchicci & King, 2007; Etzion, 2007). It may also be a way for revitalizing the resource-based view (Barney, Ketchen, & Wright, 2011) to acknowledge environmental- and social-related aspects as equally relevant sources for companies’ success.

Third, within CSP dimensions, it is possible to identify different sources for a business case. The strongest relation to CFP is identified for CSP reputation. The intangible character of corporate reputation, which is difficult to replicate and potentially the most overarching outcome measure for CSP, leads to sustained superior financial profit (Melo & Garrido-Morgado, 2012; P. W. Roberts & Dowling, 2002; Sabate & Puente, 2003). On the other hand, the strong correlation for CSP philanthropy reiterates that instrumental and moral initiatives can supplement each other (Brammer & Millington, 2008; Hahn, Pinkse, Preuss, & Figge, 2016). CSP disclosure as well as CSP audits, processes, and policies are significantly weaker correlations compared to the rest of the CSP dimensions. The limited standardization of CSP disclosure practices (Busch, Bauer, & Orlitzky, 2016) seems, in fact, to encourage companies to provide primarily beneficial rather than unbiased CSP information (Schultze & Trommer, 2012; Ullmann, 1985). The significantly weaker correlation of CSP disclosure may point to reliability and validity issues of CSP data. One way of overcoming such data limitations can be to strengthen efforts toward a more stringent – and maybe even obligatory – extra-financial data disclosure. Standardization efforts of the Sustainable Accountings Standards Board (SASB, 2015) and the European Union (EU, 2014) are promising steps forward in this regard.

# Corporate social and financial performance

Fourth, our findings suggest that operational performance is significantly and more highly correlated to CSP than other CFP categories. This finding mirrors other researchers’ claims that operational performance such as productivity is located closer to the value creation source within a firm; it better reflects organizational performance than potentially distorted CFP categories like accounting- or market-based measures (McWilliams et al., 1999; Peloza, 2009; Rowley & Berman, 2000; Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986).

Fifth, it is an interesting phenomenon that correlations shrink for different CFP categories – perceptual performance having the highest correlation and CSP mutual funds the lowest. The closer research gets to realized market performance, the smaller the effects. Several reasons may explain why empirical studies on CSP mutual funds exhibit a relatively weak CSP-CFP relation. Realized performance in mutual funds depends on the overlapping effects of systematic and idiosyncratic risks (Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, & Xu, 2001; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009), construction constraints (Clarke, de Silva, & Thorley, 2002), and costs for portfolio implementation which can be as high as 2.5% per annum in various fees that are carried by the average mutual fund (Barber, Odean, & Zheng, 2005; Carhart, 1997; Khorana, Servaes, & Tufano, 2009). The ‘drowned out by other noise’ argument (Peloza, 2009, p. 1527) thus seems to be even more valid for mutual funds, which are the ultimate amalgam of market-based measures. Nevertheless, in the worst case, mutual funds investors could expect to lose nothing compared to conventional mutual fund investments.

Sixth, we expected that early published analyses would show greater effect sizes compared with subsequently published meta-analyses. This potential diminishing effect over time as data accumulate is well documented (Trikalinos & Ioannidis, 2005). Indeed, we find significantly lower correlations for more recent meta-studies compared to older studies. However, the additional analysis at primary study level (n = 551) revealed that the shrinkage in correlations in the meta-analyses most likely does not indicate a shrinkage of the actual CSP-CFP relation. Correlations at primary study level, in contrast to our findings at the meta-study level, do not shrink. One explanation for this finding is that more recent meta-analytical research methods have become more sophisticated though using higher attenuation factors.

Finally, there was the suspicion raised that evidence of the CSP-CFP relation depends on the kind of publishing journal. The speculation was that SIM journals tend to publish ‘better results’. Interestingly, we find the opposite result: ‘truth is not made’ in special SIM journals and low-impact factor journals, but rather, in particular, in high-impact factor and general management journals, at least at a meta-analysis level. We did not discover any publication bias analyzed by Fail Safe, funnel plot, or with regards to the publishing status of a paper. In line with previous findings (Aguinis et al., 2011; Lipsey & Wilson, 1993), we also reveal that the methodological quality of meta-analyses has no influence on the reported effect sizes.

Concluding, this study takes an instrumental point of view: we ask whether it pays to be good and find that in fact it does. In light of the urgent global challenges that society faces, it appears essential that firms and investors consider any action possible to safeguard the living conditions for future generations. They can be encouraged that on first glance competing instrumental and moral motivations can supplement each other.

# Abstract

Purpose – This purpose of this paper is to identify the possible sources of variation of results in prior studies linking corporate social responsibility (CSR) with corporate financial performance (CFP).

Design/methodology/approach – A meta-analysis was performed on 51 prior studies included in Orlitzky et al. in order to ensure compatibility with previous results. The meta-analysis is based on sub-groups of papers in five-year time intervals focusing on sample size and methodology employed as the sources of variation concerning the nexus between CSR and CFP.

Findings – The major finding of the study is that sample size and methodology are significant sources of variation in measuring the link between CSR and CFP.

Research limitations/implications – The findings are likely to help develop a structural framework towards broadening and deepening our understanding of the debate regarding the sources of variation in the measurement of CSR and CFP link. This research is limited to papers published up to 1999 as included in Orlitzky et al. Future research can update the findings by using data beyond 1999.

Originality/value – This paper can be considered an advance on the previous research as it contributes to broadening our understanding of the possible source of causes of variation in results of studies linking CSR with CFP.

# 1. Introduction

Research into corporate social responsibility (CSR) has generated considerable interest amongst academic and practitioners over the past decades. The issue has gained renewed momentum in the post global financial crisis era. For the purpose of this paper CSR is defined as those responsibilities that corporations undertake to satisfy organisational goals as well as societal needs in a balanced way that serves the interests of both businesses and the community. Various facets of CSR have been researched in the past. These include, for example, managerial attitudes towards CSR (Quazi, 2003), theoretical aspects of CSR and ethics (Hunt and Vitell, 1984), cross-cultural facets of CSR (Quazi and O’Brien, 2000), CSR and quality of life (Rugimbana et al., 2008), and CSR and competitive advantage (Porter and Krammer, 2005). However, one particular issue concerning the relationship between CSR and the financial performance of firms has generated enormous interest amongst academics, policy makers and practitioners (Ullmann, 1985; Marom, 2006). The issue is that businesses and practitioners would like to see a business case to justify their commitment to CSR. Numerous empirical studies aimed at finding a possible answer to the question have produced mixed results (Peloza and Papania, 2008), most of which are neither straightforward nor conclusive (Griffin and Mahon, 1997; Marom, 2006). In the theoretical vein, two contrasting models have been suggested. One is rooted in the positive impact of corporate social performance (CSP) on corporate financial performance (CFP).

while the other is based on the assumption that increased costs resulting from CSP put participant businesses in a disadvantageous position as compared to those that do not support CSR. While differing methodologies and statistical techniques have been held responsible for the lack of a consistent pattern of outcomes, an alternative approach to resolve this impasse has not been suggested in the literature. Although a few meta analyses have partially contributed to possible solutions to the issue, these results have not ultimately revealed any conclusive evidence either (e.g. Orlitzky and Benjamin, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003, Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; Frooman, 1997; Wood and Jones, 1995). This apparent lacuna in the literature has prompted our meta analysis to uncover some possible sources of variation in the outcomes of 51 of the studies that Orlitzky et al. (2003) used in their meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis re-examines some of the issues that Orlitzky et al. (2003) did not speciﬁcally look at in detail. Some factors were considered and discarded for this study. For example, industry (see Cowen et al., 1987) was discarded because insufﬁcient detail is provided in the table showing effect sizes in Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) paper. Firm size (see Orlitzky, 2001) was also discarded because individual data was not available for all the ﬁrms in the studies included in Orlitzky’s (2001) paper. Finally, country (see Quazi and O’Brien, 2000) was discarded because most studies in Orlitzky et al. (2003) were US-based. Size of sample used, statistical techniques employed and the timing of publications of the papers are all available for consideration as factors. The above three propositions were arrived at based on the available characteristics of the literature, particularly those included in Ortlitzky et al. CFP. We wish to derive a statistical measure of whether there has been any movement towards a consensus over time. Sample size is a key determinant of precision, and while Orlitzky et al. (2003) provide sample sizes, the authors carry out no further analysis of them. Researchers have used a variety of statistical techniques in their research and we wish to determine whether the choice of technique has an impact on the strength of the relationship. Time is used to subdivide studies by Grifﬁn and Mahon (1997). Sample size is provided by Orlitzky et al. (2003). Firm size is also suggested as a possible confounding variable by Orlitzky (2001). In a similar way, we examine the magnitude of the effect of sample size on effect size. Since sample size is an element of the formula for effect size, we know a priori that sample size inﬂuences affect size. Our analysis helps us to determine what the magnitude of the effect is.

To our knowledge, the effect of statistical methodology has not been studied previously. Our concern is that a restricted number of statistical techniques have been used to study the relationship between CSR and CFP and that this narrow focus on correlation, t-tests and regression may not model the complete relationship. It is to be noted that this paper includes those previous studies that looked at the relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial performance of ﬁrms in speciﬁc terms and this principle has been followed throughout the analysis process of our meta-research.

# 2. Literature review

The question of whether there is any relationship between CSR and CFP has led to lively debate amongst academics and researchers since the 1960s (Cochran and Wood, 1984). Does social responsibility pay off? Can a ﬁrm that exercises social responsibility make higher proﬁts than one that does not? Are socially responsible ﬁrms good investment risks? These are some of the typical questions raised in the literature and addressed in several studies; these have expressed contrasting views based on research ﬁndings about the possible relationship between a ﬁrm’s social responsibility and its ﬁnancial performance. For example, McGuire et al. (1988) reported three different views on this point, which can be reclassiﬁed into two meaningful models presented earlier in this paper. The ﬁrst is that ﬁrms “face a trade-off between social responsibility and ﬁnancial performance”. This view is based on the argument that socially responsible ﬁrms are economically in a more disadvantageous position than those who are less responsible as a result of the cost incurred by the former for their socially responsible actions (Preston and O’Bannon, 1997; Aupperle et al., 1985; Ullmann, 1985; Vance, 1975; Preston and O’Bannon, 1997). The second view, which is in sharp contrast to the

VOL. 8 NO. 2 2012 jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j PAGE 243

First, is that a firm may benefit from being socially responsible as it leads to increased employee morale and improved productivity (Moskowitz, 1972; Parket and Eilbirt, 1975). The cost of social responsibility may be high but can be offset by the reductions in other firm costs such as legal expenses, worker compensation costs, product replacement costs and the like (Herremans et al., 1993). A further contemporary view strongly suggests that there is a nexus between CSR and competitive advantage in terms of building a unique image of the firm in the market. A firm can build this image through CSR orientation and use that unique image as a differentiated strategy to increase its competitiveness in the market over non-CSR oriented firms (Porter and Krammer, 2004).

There is also a CSR perspective rooted in the moral principle which suggests that corporations should be socially responsible simply because it is the right thing to do irrespective of the financial outcome of that socially responsible action. This perspective is underpinned by deontological philosophy, which assesses an action or behaviour in terms of its inherent rightness or wrongness and does not take into account the nature and extent of outcome of that action (Frankena, 1973).

Overall, the literature on the relationship between CSR and CFP is inconclusive. Several issues have been held responsible for the lack of a consensus. These include inconsistent methodologies (Griffin and Mahon, 1997), misspecification of models (Ullmann, 1985), inclusion of confounding factors (Margolis and Walsh, 2003), and the lack of clarity of both CSR (Griffin, 2000) and CFP (Margolis and Walsh, 2003) variables. Ullmann (1985) summarised the findings of 12 studies as showing no clear tendency. A mixture of positive, negative and no correlation outcomes were observed. The findings regarding the relationship between social responsibility and financial performance ranged from no correlation to various significant positive or negative linear relationships (Ullmann, 1985).

Orlitzky et al. (2003) included 52 papers published from 1974 to 1999 and found a similar pattern of outcomes. Mill (2006) lists six meta-analyses from 1995-2005, spanning articles published from 1970 to 2002. It is to be noted here that there does not appear to be any research to date on the existence of possible curvilinear relationships.

Most studies of the relationship between CSR and CFP have used a regression model, correlation analysis, or a t-test. Only a few papers have used a different methodology. For example, Mill (2006) adopted a mixture of a case-control study and a longitudinal study over a four-year period and found that firms with a positive commitment to CSR recorded better financial outcomes as compared to those with no commitment to CSR. This implies that firms that have invested in CSR in programs have, in financial terms, achieved a higher level of gains.

Wu (2006) conducted a meta-analysis of 121 papers that were published prior to 2000 using subset analyses by definition of CSR, definition of CFP and firm size. In general Wu found a positive relationship between CSR and CFP. Wu also found that the relationship between CSR and CFP tended to weaken when analysis was conducted by the subgroups mentioned above. In a discussion paper, Chand (2006) pointed to an important issue by advocating the use of industry as a factor.

Most of the findings reported in the literature suggest that the correlation between corporate social responsibility and financial performance is generally positive. However, it would not be wise to conclude that the tendency is towards a positive relationship. There are a number of reasons for this reservation. These include the identification of CSR as an “elusive concept” (Lee, 1987) and the use of “poor experiments, unfortunate use of proxies, inappropriate mathematics or controls, and so forth” (Cottrill, 1990).

# 3. The rationale, scope and objectives of the research

Following the recent collapse of a number of corporations at the international level, ethics and CSR have attracted the renewed attention of boardroom barons as well as other stakeholders such as investors, creditors, legislators, politicians and the general public. While numerous aspects of CSR and ethics have been addressed in the contemporary business literature, a vital question remains unresolved. That is, to link the effects of being ethical and socially responsible to the financial performance of firms. The main reason

behind the difﬁculty of ﬁnding a clear-cut answer to the question is that research in this area has used a variety of methodologies, measurement scales and statistical methods. This has made the results debatable, and consequently no consensus has been reached. In response, some authors such as Orlitzky et al. (2003) attempted to resolve the issue using meta-analyses of results.

In view of the above, this paper is aimed towards contributing to the arrival of a possible consensus on this issue. In reaching towards the aim we have employed a sub-group meta-analysis of the results of the studies identiﬁed by Orlitzky et al. (2003). More speciﬁcally, we have conducted a number of meta-analyses of the results of studies by date of publication, sample size and statistical methodology. The aim was to ﬁnd out whether the differences in methodologies and statistical method have made any contribution to the impasse relating to the nexus between CSR and ﬁnancial performance of ﬁrms.

# 4. Methodology

A meta-analysis is used as a method of investigation for this research. Meta-analysis is an advanced technique used to combine the results of a number of studies in order to gain a better overall picture of the underlying relationships between the variable of interest in relation to a particular study. In the past, researchers simply carried out a textual analysis of studies, or applied a simple vote-counting procedure in an attempt to determine the overall nature of the relationship(s). Glass (1976) published one of the ﬁrst meta-analysis procedures for combining effect sizes in a statistically appropriate manner (Hunter et al., 1982). Meta-analysis has since been used in many studies and by now it has emerged as a useful statistical technique in terms of combining the results of a number of studies; especially in clinical trials (for example, see www.cochrane.org). Similar systematic reviews in the ﬁelds of education, crime and justice and social welfare are published by the Campbell Collaboration (see www.campbellcollaboration.org).

For the purpose of this paper we have based our meta-analysis on 51 of the papers included in Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) meta analysis. This meta analysis is the latest study in this particular area. In their abstract, Orlitzky et al. (2003) referred to 51 papers and an overall positive effect of CSR on CFP, although the effect was moderated by the deﬁnitions of CSR and CFP used in each paper. The authors provided year of publication, effect size and sample size for the 51 papers used in their original analysis. These 51 papers form the basis of our analysis for the current paper. We have decided to conﬁne our analysis to the 51 papers in order to maintain consistency with the previous work as well as to be able to compare some of the results of our meta-analysis with those of prior studies. This means that this paper will speciﬁcally focus on deﬁnitions of corporate ﬁnancial performance as used by the 51 papers that have been included in this meta-analysis ranging from return on asset (ROA) to return on investment (ROI).

As can be seen in Table I, many of the studies included in Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) meta analysis provided more than one effect size. This can be due to multiple measures of CSR and CFP, or other ways of subdividing the data. For example Davidson and Worrell (1992) report results for several different types of product recall. Herremans et al. (1993) report results across a number of years. Simerly (1994) uses seven different measures of CFP and O’Neill et al. (1989) use four different measures of CSR. In some cases it even turned out that some of the effect sizes were positive and some were negative. If this occurred, then the entry in column 4 of Table I is recorded as ‘‘variable’’. This is because the results were not consistent in their direction.

Because of the variety of effect sizes available within individual studies, in this paper we have analysed and presented the results of our meta-analysis using three choices of effect size. Firstly, we deﬁned the most pessimistic effect. The pessimistic effect refers to the effect size that is closest to zero, or equal to zero provided the effect sizes in a particular study range from positive to negative. Secondly, we deﬁned the most optimistic effect in a positive direction. The most optimistic positive effect refers to the effect size closest to 1.0 in a particular study. Third, we deﬁned the most optimistic effect in a negative direction. The most optimistic negative effect is the effect size closest to -1.0 in a particular study. The rules for obtaining these three effect sizes from the range of effect sizes in a particular paper is shown in Table II.

Notes: Codes for corporate social responsibility (CSR): D, disclosures; R, reputational indices; SA/P/O, social audit, process and outcome measures; CSR1, Aupperle’s and others’ measures of corporate principle and values. Codes for corporate financial performance (CFP): ROA, return on assets; ROE, return on equity; ROI, return on investment; P/E ratio, price/earnings ratio. An actual count of the papers that Orlitzky et al. (2003) included in their meta-analysis revealed that 51 of the papers had effects sizes recorded, hence 51 papers have been included in our meta-analysis.

We carried out our meta-analyses using these three choices of effect size in order to see the impact on the meta analyses that results from the different effect sizes reported in each of the prior studies (i.e. the 51 studies).

|Effect size|Pessimistic|Optimistic positive|Optimistic negative|
|---|---|---|---|
|Between 2x and 2y|0|0|2x|
|Between 2x and y|0|y|2x|
|Between x and y|x|y|x|

It is to be noted that in some cases, a range of sample sizes is also provided in the papers listed above (Table I). For our paper the smallest sample size will be used for the relevant analysis. This choice leads to a ‘‘worst-case’’ contribution to the meta analysis. Our results could then be even stronger if the larger sample size was taken into consideration for the relevant analysis.

Based on the above discussion, the following propositions are presented for testing:

- P1. Year of publication of the papers will have an effect on the strength of the relationship between CSR on CFP.
- P2. Sample size of the concerned studies will have an effect on the strength of the relationship between CSR on CFP.

As mentioned earlier, our meta-analysis has examined the relationships between CSR and the financial performance of firms focusing on the following aspects: five-year time intervals, sample size and methodology employed.

# 5.1 Meta analysis by five-year time intervals

We propose that time (year) of publication of the concerned studies has an effect on the results of the studies. Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) meta analysis involves 51 papers published between the period 1974-1999. In order to maintain a reasonable number of papers in each time interval, while still having a reasonably large number of time intervals, we decided to group the years of publication of the concerned papers into five-year intervals, starting in 1970. It has been assumed that the year of publication is closely related to the year(s) in which the study data was collected. Confidence intervals for the effect size by five-year time intervals can be seen in Table II. These intervals were calculated using the Hedges method described by Field (2005, pp. 301-3). In this method effect sizes are converted to standard normal variates, then their weighted average is calculated. The weights are based on the within-study and between-study variance of the studies. A confidence interval for the overall effect size is then found using the normal distribution, and a formula for the standard error of the mean effect size. Three intervals are shown for this purpose. The pessimistic interval uses the effect size closest to zero defined earlier in Table II. The optimistic positive interval used the most positive effect size defined in Table II. Finally, the optimistic negative interval uses the most negative effect size defined in Table II.

The results revealed that with the passage of five-year periods, the results tend to become more precise (confidence intervals become generally narrower). Furthermore, with the passage of time the meta-analysis estimate of effect size also tends to be more positive. In other words, it can be said that the results of the more recent studies have higher interpretive value. The conclusion that can be drawn from this finding is that the quality of studies in terms of precision and strength has improved as time progressed.

The half-decade intervals used are standard in time series analysis (e.g. Cochran and Wood, 1984). Neither two-year nor ten-year intervals provided a better indication of the change in quality as time progressed (see Table III).

Note: Only one study: n ¼ 12, r ¼ 0:22

The above results make sense because as time progresses it is to be expected that firms will improve their ability to implement CSR from a strategic viewpoint. Therefore, the likelihood of firms experiencing positive financial outcomes from CSR will increase leading to greater engagement with CSR in the long term.

# 5.2 Meta analysis by sample size

We propose that sample size has an effect on the results of the studies. Orlitzky et al. (2003) listed the sample sizes in each of the 51 papers. In some cases, a range of sample sizes is provided. We have used the smallest sample size in each case to ensure that our results reflect the weakest outcome possible. The intervals for the sample size were chosen to ensure that there were a similar number of studies in each interval. They also show a broadly exponential increase in the upper limit of the sample sizes (see Table IV).

As the sample size increases, the confidence intervals generally become narrower and the effects generally become more positive. The conclusion that can be drawn from this finding is that the quality of studies in terms of precision and strength improves as sample size increases. This result makes sense, as it is a general statistical property of estimators that they become more precise as the sample size increases.

# 5.3 Meta analysis by methodology

We propose that the method of analysis has an impact on effect size. Orlitzky et al. (2003) record the measure of CSR and CFP used in each paper, and whether the effect size was derived from a correlation or from a t statistic (see Table V).

The intervals using t-tests are always wider than the intervals using correlation. This could suggest that correlation methods give more precise results. It may also be simply due to the fact that there are more correlation studies. Furthermore, one of the studies revealed an effect size very close to 1.00, which may skew the results in favour of the correlation methodology.

We looked at the original papers to see if more detail on the method of analysis was available. Our searches located 34 of the 51 papers. Of these, only two studies used

Methods other than correlation, regression or two-sample tests. These were MANOVA and binomial tests. The effects were found to be generally positive. In terms of the width of the confidence intervals, they appear to become wider as consideration shifts from correlation and t tests and other methods. This may simply be due to the much smaller number of studies using other methodologies.

Our objective here is not to assess which methodology gives the best estimate of effect size in an absolute sense, but to compare the relative performance of methodologies employed. Our conclusion showed that the papers in the meta-analysis that employ t-tests resulted in a wider confidence interval for the effect size than papers employing correlations. Our results do not indicate which methodology provides results that are closest to the true effect size. The results do indicate that t-tests provided more consistent results than other methodologies for the papers in the meta-analysis.

# 6. Modelling the effect of year, sample size and methodology on effect size

The varying confidence intervals in the meta-analyses above suggest that a model relating effect size to sample size, year and method will reveal which of these three factors has the strongest impact on effect size. Our model is based on a multiple linear regression where sample size is a scale variable, time is a categorical variable measured in five-year intervals, and method is a categorical variable in two categories.

Once the regression model has been fitted using least squares in SPSS, it is possible to carry out an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess the relative importance of sample size, year, and method in determining effect size. The ANOVA based on the optimistic positive effect sizes is shown in Table VI.

The p-values in the last column of Table VI shows that the effect of time (five-year intervals) is not significant (p = 0.4187). However the effect of sample size is significant at the 5 per cent level (p = 0.0142), and the effect of method is also significant at the 5 per cent level (p = 0.0157). We therefore suggest that more attention be paid to increasing the sample size and choosing a powerful statistical method when designing future research on CSR.

It is noteworthy that Orlitzky (2001) studied whether the association between CSR and CFP is caused by the confounding effect of firm size. The author found that controlling for firm size still results in a positive association between CSR and CFP. Also, Orlitzky and Benjamin (2001) subdivided a meta-analysis by definition of CSR and definition of CFP. They operationalised CFP as firm risk and then further subdivided that into accounting risk and market risk. They subdivided CSR into CSP disclosures, CSP reputation indices and socials audits as well as CSR1 (see notes to Table I).

# 7. Discussion and implications

This paper has reported on three additional aspects of the relationship between CSR and CFP not explicitly covered by Orlitzky et al. (2003). We based our meta-analyses on Orlitzky et al. (2003) in order to maintain consistency with their work so that any additional findings can contribute to furthering our understanding of the elements that are causing the variation. We therefore expect that our work will prompt further research into the factors influencing the effect size on CSR and CFP. The three additional factors reported in this paper were sample size, year of publication and statistical methodology. Our meta-analysis revealed sample size and statistical methodology to be important sources of variation in the relationship between CSR and CFP followed by year of publication.

Combining sample size and statistical methodology suggests that the overall study design is an important factor influencing study effect. An implication of this is that a structural framework of the relationship between CSR and CFP and the variables that may moderate and mediate such a relationship may be effective in capturing many aspects of the relationship. An initial interpretation of the results of our meta analysis provide some important clues as to a possible structural framework capturing some important aspects of CSR and their outcomes in terms of some specification of financial performance. These specifications include variables such as profit, market share, share price, ROI and so on.

Research has also found culture to be a possible moderating factor (Pesqueux, 2005; Maignan, 2001; Quazi and O’Brien, 2000). Marom (2006) proposes a mathematical model and also suggests some mediating variables including the level of corporate reputation, the degree of business risk and the level of support of regulatory bodies. Peters and Mullen (2009) include firm size and industry as variables in their model of CSR and CFP. These variables are also considered critical, as they are likely to affect the level of CFP. Industry type and national cultures are also considered instrumental in understanding the relationship between CSR and CFP and these variables have been picked up by prior studies (Kim and Kim, 2010; Vitell et al., 2003; Maignan, 2001; Quazi and O’Brien, 2000). However, whether some other moderating or mediating factors would be relevant in the realm of the relationship is the subject of more comprehensive future studies.

In order to set up the proposed framework, new data would be needed in order to broaden our understanding of the complexities of the relationship in the context of the dynamism of the issues of CSR and CFP. For example, the current global financial crisis is about to upset much conventional wisdom that has dominated academic thought over the past half century since the global depression of the 1930s. Therefore, we are keen to extend the framework in terms of time scale into the last ten years (2000-2009) and beyond in our next study. This would then update and advance the knowledge beyond what Orlitzky et al. (2003) covered in their studies for the period 1974-1999. We would also be keen to study the effect of national culture on effect size. The current studies are exclusively based in the USA, and there has been considerable work in the past few years in the context of other countries or regions including Australia, Japan (Okamoto, 2009), Taiwan (Shen and Chang, 2009), China (Wang and Juslin, 2009) and Spain (Sanchez and Sotorrio, 2007). These studies should also be included in future research in order to develop a universal framework for understanding the link between CSR and CFP.

# 8. Limitations and future research

This paper has some limitations that should be noted. Firstly, industry has not been included as a factor in the meta-analysis. Future research should aim to examine the possible impact of this factor on CFP. Secondly, we have confined our meta-analysis to the papers included in Orlitzky et al. (2003) before 1999. Future research can update this time frame beyond 1999. Thirdly, it has been assumed that the year of publication is closely related to the year(s) in which the study data was collected. In the worst case, the study data will lag a few years behind the publication date, which will reduce the impact of time on the relationship between CSR and CFP. Future research can take account of this lag or avoid it by using study data dates as a factor. Fourthly, typologies of ways of measuring CSR and CFP would greatly assist future research in this area. Such a typology would allow researchers to connect CSR to various types of financial performance, for example ROI, ROA, ROE and the price/earnings ratio.

Future research can also link the measurement of firms’ commitment to CSR using the triple bottom line as the theoretical underpinning (Elkington, 1997). The three bottom lines are the social, economic and environmental obligations of corporations. Next, the relationship between sustainability and CSR commitment of firms can also be explored in future research that links these two to CFP.

Finally, we strongly suggest that future researchers should consider a wider variety of statistical methodologies when studying the effect of CSR on CFP. Only two papers out of 34 employed methods other than the very traditional t-tests and regression. Whilst it is perfectly sensible to use a t-test or regression when the data and research questions call for them, our results do show that methodology has a significant effect on effect size. Therefore, we propose that the use of a wider range of methodologies may help answer important questions about the relationship between CSR and CFP.

# 9. Conclusion

To summarise, we carried out a sub-group meta-analysis of studies investigating the extent of the relationship between CSR and CFP. While individual studies have found a relationship that varies from strongly positive to strongly negative, a meta-analysis conducted by Orlitzky et al. (2003) found that the overall effect was moderately positive. Our re-analysis by sub-groups according to sample size, year of publication and methodology shows that the effect of time is not a significant factor in determining the effect size. However, sample size and statistical technique play an important role in determining the link between CSR and CFP. By combining these two factors, we can conclude that research methodology can be singled out as the major source of variation in the strength of the relationship between CSR and CFP.

Identifying this major source of variation in the measurement of links between CSR and CFP will contribute to the refinement of the measurement process in further research. More specifically, this sub-group meta-analysis can be considered as an advancement over the previous meta analysis in that our analysis identified more specific contributing factors towards resolving the controversy regarding the acceptance of CSR as a viable business choice. This research will also contribute to future modelling of the effect of CSR on CFP. New important variables have been identified, and others gathered together from existing literature as a guide to future modelling processes.

# 1. Introduction

Climate change and sustainability have drawn broad attention internationally. World leaders have found a general consensus on this issue, as stated in the 2015 Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While member countries have agreed to work cooperatively to mitigate the severe problem of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, one of the major challenges is the financing mitigation and adaptation action to climate change and sustainability. Significant amount of investment is needed for solving the problem. Maintaining the 2° C temperature threshold of the Paris Agreement requires $53 trillion in energy-related investments by 2035 (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2014).

Ji and Zhang (2019) document that financial development is a critical determinant for the further progress of China’s renewable energy sector. In 2010, the Green Climate Fund (GCF) was established by 194 countries, aiming to provide financial support to developing countries to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to climate change. Since then, the term “green finance” has frequently appeared in reports of international organizations (see for example, IFC, 2017) and national governments. Relevant discussions have also attracted enormous attention from academics. Green finance per se, however, remains vaguely defined and is often mixed with climate finance.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

It is often hard to distinguish between green finance and climate finance. According to IFC (2017), green finance is defined as “financing of investments that provide environmental benefits”, whereas the latter is proposed and defined by UNFCCC as “local, national or transnational financing-drawn from public, private and alternative sources of financing-that seeks to support mitigation and adaption actions that will address climate change”.

Though subtly different in definitions, at the heart of both terms is the financing tools for coping with climate change and others for sustainability.1

Green finance clearly has paramount policy importance, reflected by the intensive discussions among international organizations and national governments since its emergence. It has also led to increasing interest among academic researchers. Zhang (2018), for example, emphasizes the importance of carbon finance within the general framework of green finance.

This paper starts from summarizing recent literature, aiming to first draw a big picture of relevant academic research. By learning from the current status, we hope to form a proper understanding of the conceptual issues, and more importantly, to identify development trends and provide useful guidance on future research directions in this important and developing subject.

# 2. Methodology and basic setups

The method used in this paper is a bibliometric analysis approach. It was first used by Pritchard (1969) and has gained wide popularity to aid quantitative analysis in understanding the literature. We use CiteSpace, a software developed by Chen (2006), to show visualizing patterns of the previous studies on green finance. Given the fact that a clear conceptual definition of green finance is lacking, we

1 We thank an anonymous referee for pointing out the issue of which term is a better choice “green finance” and “climate finance”. Green finance (as in IFC, 2017) will be used to emphasize global concerns on environmental issues but we do want to clarify that this term is broadly defined and thus indicating no differences to climate finance.

concentrate on three aforementioned keywords search, namely, green finance, climate finance and carbon finance. We also include a number of keywords with small variations to increase the coverage of relevant literature, which are green financing, climate financing, carbon financing, green investment, and green bond.

For the retaining the general information and ease of search, we impose several restrictions on identifying relevant researches. First, all candidate papers should be in the Web of Science core collection. Second, papers should be Articles indexed in one of the following indices: Science citation index-expanded (SCIE), Social science citation index (SSCI), Arts & Humanities citation index (A&HCI), and Emerging source citation index (ESCI). Effective samples cover the range from 2001 to 2018. Third, we manually go through all titles and abstracts to exclude irrelevant articles.

In total, 381 papers have been included in our sample. The number of papers published in each year is plotted in figure 1. A clear upward trend of publications can be spotted during the sample period. Noticeably, as opposed to the slow and steady growth trend before 2015, the number of relevant publications has increased sharply since 2015, which implies substantially increased interests from academics on green finance since the 2015 Paris Agreement.

# 3. Key results

Our bibliometric analysis will focus on four main areas and aim to answer the following questions:

- Which journals are these paper published?
- Where are the authors from (countries of origin)?
- What are the key interests (keywords analysis) of these studies?
- How are these paper cited in the literature?

Page 6 of 20

# 3.1 Journal distribution

Table 1 reports a list of journals according to their numbers of publications (of more than four relevant papers per journal) in our sample. Clearly, although finance is defined as a key element of green finance, the main journals publishing related works turn out to be those who concentrate on environmental and climate change. Not even one finance journal made to the list. In fact, by examining the list of papers published in finance journals, we did find some relevant ones, namely, one from Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis (Heinkel et al., 2001), two from International Review of Financial Analysis (Bredin et al., 2014; Turner, 2012), two from Emerging Market Finance and Trade (He and Liu, 2018; Celik and Binatli, 2018), and one from Finance Research Letters (Febi et al., 2018). Although the first paper in this collection is from a top finance journal, evidence here confirms what Diaz-Rainey et al. (2017) conclude, that the main stream finance journals are generally silent on the climate change issue.

Three key economics journals appearing in this list are Ecological Economics, Energy Economics and Environmental & Resource Economics, which are all field journals of environmental and resource economics. It is not hard to notice that green finance is yet to become the interest of mainstream economics or finance journals, despite its widely acknowledged importance and an urgent need of full-fledged policy and regulatory tools. Much remains to be done to bring this fast developing topic into the spotlight of mainstream economic and finance research, and to fill the wide gap existing in extant literature.

(Insert Table 1 here)

Two reasons exist to support our claims here. First, the amount of investment in

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Green/climate projects have increased substantially and maintained a strong growth momentum in the recent years. For example, global green bond issuance had a historical record of 155.5 billion US dollars in 20172, creating high demand for academic research in this area; Second, more people are interested in this area with increasing research outputs by a broader categories of academic researchers. Although it is a bit too early to see more publications now, a number of events associated with main stream finance journals in the last couple of years will surely link to relevant outputs (e.g. 2018 RFS Climate Finance Initiative in London3). Lacking of relevant research also means potentially high impact with ground-breaking research in this area. Overall, we are very positive to make the claim that an opportunity exists.

# 3.2 Authors’ country of origin

It is also worth exploring where the keenness on green finance research mainly comes from. We look at this issue by linking it to the authors’ countries of origin. Figure 2 summarizes the information of country of origin of the authors. It depicts a clear picture showing that the main contributors to the recent fast progress of this field are mainly from the US, Europe and a few other developed countries. It is not surprising to see the dominance of US-based researchers in this field, as the World Bank, UN and many other most influential international organizations have their headquarters based in the US, which can much facilitate and encourage relevant research. For years, Europe has been the most enthusiastic promoter of global cooperation on climate change. Its world’s largest carbon trading market (EU ETS) with a long history has attracted substantial attentions from academic researchers.

on green energy issues. The color in the figure also demonstrates time dimension. The lighter the color is, the earlier the work appears. It is observed that this subject is piloted and led by researchers from the US and England, while the majority of studies from other regions follow up and appear later.

(Insert Figure 2 here)

Among all visible contributors’ origins in the graph, China and India are the only two emerging economies. Considering the sizes of these two countries and their shares of global GHG emissions, it is very important to have China and India actively participating in the debates. The unbalanced distribution between developed and developing countries of origin may also imply that developed countries remain dominating on green finance topics. In the international negotiations on climate agreements, developing countries have been playing an increasingly important role. This is argued to be one of the main reasons that a universal agreement is difficult to reach (Costantini et al., 2016).

Although developed countries are mainly the source of financing, without active cooperation from developing countries, it is hard to achieve efficient green financing or investment. Further investigations and understanding on developing economies and their status quo are very necessary.

Of course, we have to acknowledge that academic research has been dominated by developed economies and author structure is unlikely to change much in a short period of time. Issues in developing countries however, should be one of the main future directions of research.

concerns in the literature. The objective of developing green finance is to cope with climate change and this is clearly a policy relevant question.

(Insert Table 2 here)

Figure 3 provides a graphical illustration of keywords appearing in these articles. The graphical information combined with the world top ten list reveals some interesting patterns. In addition to the core issues, a number of keywords are shown to have attracted much attention. For example, Management is ranked the 10th, which reflects the concerns on how green finance is managed by a state or in a market. Another relevant keyword (Governance) also visible in Figure 3 is related to management, indicating that proper governing is an important concern to green finance. Researchers are also interested in Impact, or how much green finance may affect sustainability and development (Growth). China is the key player of green finance and thus is unsurprisingly an important research focus. Market, Finance and Investment fail to make to the top ten list, but they are clearly visible in Figure 3, implying the needs to study green finance topics from finance aspects.

(Insert Figure 3 here)

Keywords analysis conveys important information that can be used to clarify the conceptual points of green finance. It is obvious that green finance is related to climate change and should be policy driven. Issues of financing or investment on climate adaption are the key subject of interests. Green finance is not only relevant to environmental economists or scientists, but also requires contribution from economists and financial economists.

# 3.4 Citation analysis

Page 10 of 20

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Papers on green finance are generally well cited. The average number of citations for the sample composed of 381 papers is 8.54. The highest citation number is 183 on Heinkel et al. (2001). Table 3 reports the top ten most cited papers in our sample. These ten papers come from very widely ranged sources, which indicates once again the interdisciplinary nature of this subject.

(Insert Table 3 here)

We also investigate the source of references cited by these 381 papers. It is plotted in Figure 4. Clearly it is dominated by science, climate change and environmental journals. Though a few economics journals (for example, American Economic Review, Ecological Economics) are shown to affect these researches, it is obvious that finance journals are hardly involved. Citation analysis for cited journals also indicates how the relevant literature network is developed. Once again, although this area bears the name of green finance, its current studies are rarely based on main stream finance journals. It also indicates a clear need to introduce techniques and models in main stream finance research to study green finance issues.

# 4. Conclusion

This paper utilizes a simple bibliometric approach to analyze the current status and trend of development of academic research on the subject of green finance. Through ranking analysis and visualized illustration on a number of key factors of a sample of 381 relevant publications, we find important information that can help us form an accurate picture of this subject matter. Based on keywords analysis of the literature, green finance needs to be considered an interdisciplinary research.

topic that encompasses and deals with policies, investment and governance on financing and investment in climate adaption. As the authors’ country of origin analysis reveals, green finance researches are currently dominated by scholars from developed economies. Papers in this area are mainly published by policy journals or journals focusing on environmental/climate changes, while scarcely seen in mainstream economics or finance journals.

Green finance has shown its great importance and fast growing relevance. With increasing interests in recent literature but a lack of attention from mainstream economics and finance journals, it has created a gap that gives opportunities to researchers in at least three directions for future developments. First, given that green finance is essentially a matter of finance, there is urgent need to study green finance issues from finance perspectives and using techniques from finance. Topics such as green bonds, green risk management and green governance should be of interests in mainstream finance journals. Second, more studies on green finance issues from developing countries’ perspectives would be useful to regulators and policy makers to align different policy goals and develop well-defined policy objectives. With clear information advantages, scholars from developing countries will be given more chances, and more international collaboration between developing and developed countries are expected. Third, it is worth mentioning that a remarkable difference between green finance and standard finance topics is that the former is essentially policy driven. New issues in this field are thus likely to emerge with the rapidly changing international economic and political environments. Moreover, to our best knowledge, a comprehensive review of relevant literature is still not available. It is definitely worth to explore and make comparison to the results of our bibliometric analysis.

# A Meta-Analytic Review of Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate Financial Performance: The Moderating Effect of Contextual Factors

# Qian Wang, Junsheng Dou, and Shenghua Jia

# Abstract

The relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has long been a central and contentious debate in the literature. However, prior empirical studies provide indefinite conclusions. The purpose of this study is to review systematically and quantify the CSR–CFP link in a meta-analytic framework. Based on 119 effect sizes from 42 studies, this study estimates that the overall effect size of the CSR–CFP relationship is positive and significant, thus endorsing the argument that CSR does enhance financial performance. Furthermore, this work sheds light on the causal relationship between CSR and CFP. Subsequent financial performance is associated with prior social responsibility, while the reverse direction is not supported. This finding supports the instrumental stakeholder theory. As predicted, the meta-analysis results indicate that the measurement strategies of the two key constructs of CSR and CFP explain some variations of the CSR–CFP relationship. Last, this study examines the moderating effect of the environmental context on the CSR–CFP link.

work proposes that CSR in the developed world, with a relatively mature institutional system and efficient market mechanism, will be more visible than CSR in the developing world. The results show that the CSR–CFP relationship is stronger for firms from advanced economies than for firms from developing economies.

# Corporate social responsibility (CSR)

has been a subject of great interest for more than 30 years among scholars from multiple management perspectives, including cost perspective, agency theory, instrumental stakeholder theory, resource-based view (RBV), and reputation theory (Friedman, 1970; Godfrey, Merrill, & Hansen, 2009; Muller & Kraussl, 2011). The existing empirical literature has largely focused on the precise nature of the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP; Aupperle, Carroll, & Hatfield, 1985; Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003; Ullmann, 1985). Since Bragdon and Marlin (1972) and Moskowitz (1972) published the first studies (Margolis & Walsh, 2003), more than 100 studies have empirically examined the relationship between CSR and CFP. However, the inconsistent findings for the linkage between CSR and CFP are still far from clear (Margolis & Walsh, 2003; Ullmann, 1985; Waddock & Graves, 1997). Some studies suggest that being socially responsible does increase a firm’s performance (Lev, Petrovits, & Radhakrishnan, 2010; Surroca, Tribo, & Waddock, 2010); other studies suggest that it does not (Aupperle et al., 1985; Graves & Waddock, 2000). Moreover, recent empirical studies have explored nonlinear relationships and have argued that CSR cannot universally produce favorable returns for all firms all the time (Brammer & Millington, 2008; H. Wang, Choi, & Li, 2008).

Researchers have identified a number of reasons for the failure to reach a consensus on the implications of improved social performance for financial performance. At the theoretical level, there is concern about stakeholder mismatching (Wood & Jones, 1995), theoretical shortcomings and inadequate definitions of key terms (Ullmann, 1985), “the conceptual determinants of CSR, and consequently the theoretical expectations of the CSR-CFP relationships” (Brammer & Millington, 2008, p. 1326), and the boundaries of CSR (Barnett, 2007). At the same time, a variety of operational shortcomings are also attributed to the mixed findings, such as operationalization and methodological differences in the definitions of social and financial performance.

(Griffin & Mahon, 1997): failure to control some other important variables that have been thought to have direct influence on firm performance, such as risk, industry affiliation, asset, age (Cochran & Wood, 1984), investment in research and development (R&D), and advertising expenditure (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000).

To figure out this inconsistent relationship, some scholars have used the method of meta-analysis to investigate the CSR–CFP linkage (Margolis & Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003). Although these previous meta-analyses on CSR–CFP linkage have examined a variety of theoretical and methodology shortcomings mentioned above, to date there has been little meta-analysis focus on the moderating effects of contextual factors that can explain the heterogeneity of the CSR–CFP linkage. Given that the empirical research on CSR has provided evidence suggesting that contingency factors, such as the level of dynamism in firms’ operational environment and industrial characteristics, may be the important factors in understanding the inconclusive results (H. Wang et al., 2008), it is surprising that the extant meta-analyses on CSR have not examined the moderating effects of the contextual contingency on the relationship between CSR and CFP. The present study seeks to fill this void in the CSR literature.

Moreover, dramatic changes have occurred in the global economy over the past several decades. Emerging economies, such as China and India, have realized a fast integration into the global economic system. But there is still a significant gap in the market development and institutional environment between developing and developed economies. Such market and institutional variations in the cross-national context may moderate the degree to which CSR can contribute to the bottom line. The authors argue here that CSR in the developed world, with a relatively mature institutional system and efficient market mechanism, will be more visible than CSR in the developing world. The authors would, therefore, expect more financial performance to be gained in developed countries than in developing countries. In recent studies, some scholars have appealed for more attention to the cross-national comparison (Campbell, 2007). But due to the shortage of multinational data, the comparative research based on different backgrounds is still rare. This article intends to fill the essential research gap that exists among CSR studies. The meta-analysis applied in this study can overcome these issues to a certain extent by integrating empirical results across diverse contexts.

The present study seeks to extend the CSR literature by addressing the moderating effect of contingency factors. The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 42 studies published from 2003 to 2012 to get a statistically aggregated result of the CSR–CFP relationship. Orlitzky et al. (2003) tested the linkage of CSR and CFP through a meta-analysis of 52 studies from 1970 to

# Business & Society

2002, so the authors of this study searched for papers published during or after the year of 2003. In this study, the authors assume that the measurement strategy and environmental context may explain the heterogeneity of the CSR–CFP linkage. The intended objectives of this article are fourfold: (a) to provide a general relationship between CSR and CFP from accumulated research, (b) to investigate the direction of causality between CSR and CFP, (c) to examine the moderating effect of the operationalization of CSR and CFP on this linkage, and (d) to assess the moderating effect of contingency factors.

The reminder of the article comprises five additional sections. The “Theory and Hypotheses” section reviews the literature on the linkage between CSR and CFP. The role of measurement strategy and environmental context on this relationship are particularly highlighted, and with this review, the research hypotheses are proposed. The “Method” section describes the methodological approach and data for this study. The “Results” section presents the empirical results, whereas the “Discussion” section discusses and outlines the study’s contributions and implications, as well as some limitations, and suggests avenues for further research. The “Conclusion” section summarizes and concludes.

# Theory and Hypotheses

# The CSR–CFP Linkage

CSR–CFP-negative-association. Those researchers arguing for a negative relationship between social and financial performance believe that firms that perform responsibly are at a competitive disadvantage compared with their unresponsive peers (Aupperle et al., 1985), because they impose a direct cost on the firm (Barnett & Salomon, 2006; Ullmann, 1985). This point of view is mainly supported by neoclassical economic theory.

Another dominant critique of business social involvement originates from the principal–agent paradigm, which suggests that the purpose of the firm is primarily for the profit of the stockholders. Friedman (1970), the well-known critic of CSR, supposed that in responding to calls for socially responsible practices, executives take money and resources that otherwise go to stockholders and dedicate those resources to enhance their personal benefits. According to agency theory, the agents (the top management team) and the principals (the shareholders) always show a conflict of interests and objectives. Therefore, managers may act in their own best interests, but at the expense of the firm’s owners. As a result, the costs involved in agency relationships may be high and damage corporate value.

# Wang et al.

Although the enterprises may bear the direct cost and agency cost of social responsibility, they can also obtain benefits from CSR. In fact, both the academic and practical worlds have expressed more and more doubts about the point of maximization of shareholder wealth held by neoclassical economists. Recently, frequently exposed corporate scandals have gradually given rise to a wave of rethink and debate on the role of the firm to society. Especially following the global financial crisis, public concern, regulatory forces, media interest, reputation pursuit, consumer pressure, and intraindustry peer pressure have led to the prevalence of CSR on firms’ top management agendas. Actually, the value of a firm depends on the cost not only of explicit claims from shareholders but also of implicit claims from other stakeholders (McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988). Besides stockholders and bondholders, other stakeholders also have implicit contracts. If corporate management fails to respond to these implicit claims, parties to implicit contracts may attempt to transform these implicit agreements into explicit agreements that will, as a result, be more costly.

# CSR–CFP-positive-association

Instrumental stakeholder theory, an important strand within stakeholder theory, supports the positive association between CSR and CFP. This theory suggests that firms view their stakeholders as part of an environment that must be managed to assure revenues, profits, and, ultimately, returns to shareholders (Berman, Wicks, Kotha, & Jones, 1999). Attention to stakeholder concerns may help a firm avoid decisions that might prompt stakeholders to undercut or thwart its objectives. This possibility arises because it is the stakeholders who control resources that can facilitate or enhance the implementation of corporate decisions (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978). It has been demonstrated that employees show greater commitment to a firm that has a good public image in supplying human capital (Dutton, Dukerich, & Harquail, 1994). Moreover, such firms are often perceived as an attractive employer by job seekers (Backhaus, Stone, & Heiner, 2002; Greening & Turban, 2000). Customers may respond to positive social performance by increasing their demand for the firm’s products or services, or by paying premium prices (Bhattacharya & Sen, 2003). Furthermore, some investors, particularly certain institutional ones, are more willing to invest in firms known for pursuing CSR (Barnett & Salomon, 2006; Graves & Waddock, 1994; Johnson & Greening, 1999).

Others have augmented stakeholder theory with aspects of RBV (Salancik & Pfeffer, 1978). Drawing upon the RBV, researchers claim that by developing close relationships with primary stakeholders, a firm can develop certain intangible resources such as innovation (Klassen & Whybark, 1999), human resources (Russo & Harrison, 2005), and organizational culture (Howard-Grenville, Hoffman, & Wirtenberg, 2003), which enable the most efficient and competitive.

use of the firm’s assets and help it acquire a competitive advantage over its rivals (Surroca et al., 2010). CSR can function as a means for firms to secure the acquisition of critical resources controlled by stakeholders (H. Wang et al., 2008) and help firms to reduce the risk of losing resources they already control (Barnett & Salomon, 2006; Brammer & Millington, 2004; Godfrey, 2005).

Strategy scholars have recently developed a construct of “moral reputation capital” that links CSR activities to shareholder value from the corporate reputation theory (Godfrey, 2005; Godfrey et al., 2009; Muller & Kraussl, 2011). The “insurance” perspective suggests that firms with strong reputations for CSR will be able to preserve firm value in times of crises better than firms with weak reputations for CSR (Godfrey et al., 2009; Schnietz & Epstein, 2005). When negative events occur, stakeholders will respond based on both the negative effects of the act and the perceived state of mind and intentions of the offender (Godfrey et al., 2009). Godfrey et al. (2009) argued that moral reputation capital derived from CSR would reduce the overall severity of sanctions, but firms with no CSR activity lack this form of buffering goodwill and stand exposed to potentially greater impacts.

So far the discussion suggests that the actual relationship between CSR and financial performance is generally positive from stakeholder theory, RBV, and reputation theory formulations.

Despite a long and contentious debate about the theory of CSR business case, the majority of results from prior empirical studies and meta-analyses have pointed to a positive relationship between CSR and CFP. Among the 109 published studies from 1972 to 2002 collected by Margolis and Walsh (2003), almost half of the studies (54) reported a positive relationship, only 7 studies found a negative relationship, and 28 results pointed to nonsignificant relationships. Based on previous findings, the present authors expect a generally positive association between CSR and CFP in this meta-analysis. If CSR contributes to CFP, then it rejects the idea that CSR is necessarily inconsistent with shareholder wealth maximization. If social responsibility contributes to CFP, then a firm’s resources are being used to advance the interests of shareholders, the rightful claimants in the neoclassical economy (Margolis & Walsh, 2003).

Based on these assumptions, the authors assert the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 1:

CSR will have a positive impact on CFP.

# Direction of Causality Between CSR and CFP

The authors further shed light on the causal relation between CSR and financial performance. Three views on the direction of causality between CSR

Wang et al. - 7

and CFP have been tested empirically: (a) the view that prior CSR positively influences CFP, (b) the view that prior CFP positively influences CSR, and (c) the view defining a recursive relationship between both constructs (Surroca et al., 2010).

The first research stream, related to instrumental stakeholder theory, RBV, and reputation theory, mentioned earlier, suggests that prior CSR positively influences subsequent CFP. This view was confirmed by many empirical studies conducted in different contexts, such as Barnett and Salomon (2006), Bhattacharya and Sen (2003), Brammer and Millington (2004), and Godfrey et al. (2009). The second strand of literature is supported by slack resources theory, which proposes that firms with available slack resources from high levels of financial performance may spend those resources on “doing good by doing well” and those resource allocations may result in improved CSR overall (Waddock & Graves, 1997). In contrast, firms that are in financial trouble may have little freedom to invest in CSR activities such as philanthropy. Some of the empirical evidence, particularly McGuire, Schneeweis, and Branch (1990) and Godfrey et al. (2009), provides support for the slack resources theory. These two previous streams of research were reconciled by Surroca et al. (2010), who argued that causation may run in both directions. That is, better CSR may lead to improved financial performance. Meanwhile, better financial performance may lead to improved CSR. This meta-analysis will test which theoretical hypothesis is right, or whether both of them are supported across the accumulated research. Based on prior studies and empirical findings (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Surroca et al., 2010; Waddock & Graves, 1997), the present authors assert that the basic theoretical underpinnings of these CSR–CFP links are correct, so that there is a positive association between social and financial outcomes in both directions. This assertion involves two hypotheses:

# Hypothesis 2a:

A higher level of prior CSR is associated with better subsequent financial performance.

# Hypothesis 2b:

A better prior financial performance is associated with improved subsequent CSR.

# Measurement Strategy as a Moderator of the CSR–CFP Relationship

CSR is a multidimensional construct defined as the integration of the principles, processes, and policies related to social issues (Wartick & Cochran, 1985), so it is very difficult to identify and measure such a wide range of corporate social behavior. Because little clarity has been reached on the

# Business & Society

Measurement of CSR, some studies have argued that the measurement problem is one fundamental reason for the uncertainty about the relationship between CSR and CFP (Waddock & Graves, 1997). To test whether different measurement strategies lead to systematically different effect sizes across empirical studies, this meta-analysis will break down the whole samples into different CSR subsets based on different operationalizations of this construct.

In prior studies, five kinds of measurement strategies have been frequently used: (a) CSR reputation ratings (Donker, Poff, & Zahir, 2008; Soana, 2011), (b) content analysis (Aras, Aybars, & Kutlu, 2010; Karagiorgos, 2010), (c) surveys (Brik, Rettab, & Mellahi, 2011; Mishra & Suar, 2010), (d) social auditing database (J. Choi & Wang, 2009; Godfrey et al., 2009), and (e) a proxy variable such as corporate philanthropy (Muller & Kraussl, 2011; H. Wang et al., 2008).

Although these five operationalizations are commonly used in the area of CSR research, each of them has limitations. The first type of method uses expert evaluations of corporate policies, such as in Moskowitz (1972). The validity of this methodology depends, to a great extent, on the skills and qualifications of those experts making the assessments (Abbott & Monsen, 1979). To overcome this shortcoming, Fortune magazine gathered a large number of executives, outside directors, and corporate analysts to rate firms. Fortune has conducted the ranking each Fall since 1982 and published summary results each January. The ranking covers the largest firms in 20 to 25 industry groups, with the 10 largest companies in each industry being rated on eight attributes: financial soundness, long-term investment value, use of corporate assets, quality of management, innovativeness, quality of products or services, use of corporate talent, and community and environmental responsibility. Fortune’s reputation rating was popularly used since the 1980s, but this method is viewed as a measure of overall management of a firm rather than being specific to CSR (Waddock & Graves, 1997).

Other researchers have used content analysis of corporate publications such as annual reports, personal handbooks, employee newspapers, and so on. According to Abbott and Monsen (1979), content analysis is a technique for gathering data that consists of codifying qualitative information in anecdotal and literary form into categories to derive quantitative scales of varying levels of complexity. Abbott and Monsen used the Social Involvement Disclosure (SID) scale developed by Ernst and Ernst to code firms’ activities for specific social involvement. Because the research costs are reasonably low in comparison with other forms of data collection, content analysis is widely used in CSR research. However, a reliability issue may emerge when...

regarding corporate publications as a source of social involvement data. That is, whether the reported variation in social activities among firms is a reflection of real activities or is only an index of company policies on communicating activities to shareholders (Abbott & Monsen, 1979).

The survey, as one of the dominant research approaches in the social science area, is often used in measuring CSR. Drawing on Carroll’s (1979) CSR construct, Aupperle et al. (1985) developed a forced-choice survey instrument to assess a corporate respondent’s social-responsibility orientation. This forced-choice methodology is commonly used to minimize the social desirability of responses. But survey methodologies still have problems relating to return rates and a common method bias when testing the relationship between CSR and CFP.

To deal with the measurement problems noted above, the firm Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini (KLD) constructed an index of Corporate Social Performance (CSP) based on eight corporate social performance attributes rated consistently across the entire Standard and Poor’s 500. As an independent rating service that focuses exclusively on assessment of corporate social performance across a range of dimensions related to stakeholder concerns, KLD exhibits robust construct validity around its underlying measures (see Hart & Sharfman, 2012) and has been used by a number of researchers in strategy (Waddock & Graves, 1997), human resources (Turban & Greening, 1997), business and society (Mattingly & Berman, 2006), and finance (Fisman, Heal, & Nair, 2005). The use of the KLD data set, however, is not without its critics. The most serious query is credulity problems, because the data can be and are often stretched to meet the objectives of individual researchers (Godfrey et al., 2009).

The one-dimensional proxy is another frequently used method (Lev et al., 2010; H. Wang et al., 2008). Pollution control investment and corporate philanthropy are usually employed as unidimensional proxy measures for CSR (Bowman & Haire, 1975; Brammer & Millington, 2005). The one-dimensional proxy variable is viewed as a highly visible and objective component with specific attributes that make it particularly amenable to empirical research. But it may not properly reflect the overall level of a company’s CSR and may be difficult to apply consistently across the range of industries and companies that need to be studied (Waddock & Graves, 1997).

As noted, each measurement strategy has its advantages and disadvantages, so it is not easy to capture a truly representative CSR measure in the relevant social domains. Waddock and Graves (1997) suggested that the previous mixed findings on the relationship between profitability and corporate social performance may be partly caused by measurement difficulties. Consequently, the whole sample will be divided into five subsets to examine

# Business & Society

whether CSR measurement strategies moderate the relationship between CSR and CFP. The authors posit the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 3:

Different CSR measurement strategies will lead to systematically different effect sizes across empirical studies.

Besides the different operationalizations of CSR, Wood and Jones (1995) were concerned about the stakeholder mismatching problem due to the different financial performance measures, which are focused on different aspects of performance with each one subject to particular biases. Three types of CFP measurement have been tested as dependent variables in previous studies: (a) accounting-based performance (Return on Assets [ROA] or Return on Equity [ROE]), (b) market-based performance (price to earnings ratio or Tobin’s Q), and (c) perceptual measures, such as self-reported surveys of market share, growth, profitability, or size in comparison with other organizations. In this article, the moderate effects of CFP measurements are also examined as follows:

# Hypothesis 4:

Different CFP measurement strategies will lead to systematically different effect sizes across empirical studies.

# Contingency Factors as Moderators of the CSR–CFP Relationship

The authors posit that CSR is positively related to firm financial performance. Furthermore, the authors expect the relationship between CSR and CFP to vary significantly among different operational environments. Some scholars have begun to notice that returns to CSR are contingent, not universal (Ullmann, 1985). Barnett (2007) argued that CSR cannot universally produce favorable returns for all firms all the time, so favorable findings will never be replicable across all data sets. Therefore, researchers should attempt to find contingency factors that explain heterogeneity in financial returns to CSR. Accordingly, two environmental contingency factors, namely, market development and institutional environment, are critical in determining the extent to which firms might benefit from charitable contributions (Doh & Guay, 2006; H. Wang & Qian, 2011).

As mentioned before, CSR contributes to the bottom line via its favorable influence on the firm’s relationships with important stakeholders. The stakeholder relationship is the key mechanism through which firms can gain positive returns from CSR activities. Furthermore, firm visibility serves as a prerequisite for stakeholder response to firm actions (H. Wang & Qian, 2011).

# Wang et al.

Stakeholders need to have the information regarding firms’ social behavior to make a reasonable response. Therefore, when visible firms can draw greater attention from their stakeholders, it will be easier for them to get positive responses from stakeholders. In contrast, firms may not benefit much from social involvement under a low firm visibility and stakeholder awareness, even if they have invested a lot in CSR. Obviously, a firm’s visibility and stakeholder awareness vary significantly across different levels of development of the market in which the firm operates. Due to the various information channels and effective market supervision, business information will be more symmetric and valid in a developed market. Then, the stakeholders can obtain information about firms’ social behavior more efficiently and make responses more accurately. Subsequently, those responses for CSR will turn into positive financial gains. But the situation is different in a developing market. Short of advanced media exposure and efficient market supervision, the active and initiative social efforts of firms competing in less developed markets will be less noticed and gain unequal financial gains compared with those in well-developed markets.

Aside from the market environment, the institutional environments are also different between developed and developing economies, and such institutional variations in a cross-national context may moderate the degree to which stakeholders can influence managers (Campbell, 2007). Campbell (2007) has argued that the relationship between socially responsible corporate behavior and economic conditions is moderated by several institutional factors, such as public and private regulations, the presence of nongovernmental and other independent organizations that monitor corporate behavior, institutionalized norms regarding appropriate corporate behavior, associative behavior among corporations themselves, and organized dialogues among corporations and their stakeholders. In a developed market, the local government will publish specific policies to encourage firms to take social responsibility. For example, local communities may provide a philanthropic firm with tax breaks or favorable terms for using local infrastructure (H. Wang et al., 2008). Then firms may decrease costs and increase income via CSR thereby increasing CFP. But in a less developed market, firms cannot gain such positive returns without well-forced institutional systems. Under a loose and ineffective governmental regulation, corporations would act in more socially irresponsible ways and would not worry about the potential risk of regulatory sanctions. Thus, those socially unresponsive firms incur fewer direct costs and, ceteris paribus, reap higher profits than socially responsive firms. In that sense, socially responsive companies are at a competitive disadvantage compared with their unresponsive peers. This competitive disadvantage is particularly serious in an era of increased globalization, because the capacity for

# Business & Society

firms to move investments and productions from one regulatory regime to another has increased. To retain local investment, production, jobs, and tax revenues, some national governments would ease business regulations that help militate against socially irresponsible corporate behavior (Campbell, 2007). Thus, corporations may not be able to gain competitive advantages from socially responsible behavior. So based on the above logic, the authors posit the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 5:

The relationship between CSR and CFP is stronger for firms from developed economies than from developing economies.

# Method

# Data-Collection

To ensure the representativeness and completeness of the study database, a three-stage sampling procedure was conducted to identify literature to be included in the meta-analysis (Barnett, 2007; Godfrey, 2005; Margolis & Walsh, 2003). In the first stage, the authors searched the ABI/INFORM database for studies published from 2003 to 2012 with the following search terms: corporate social responsibility, corporate social performance, environmental performance, and financial performance. Second, a manual search of several relevant journals (Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Strategic Management Journal, Organizational Studies, and Journal of Business Ethics) was also conducted. Third, the authors examined the reference sections of all major reviews of research previously published on the topic to identify any studies overlooked in the previous two stages.

Studies were selected for inclusion in the meta-analysis on the basis of three criteria. First, the meta-analysis included only those empirical studies that reported sample sizes and an outcome statistic (r, univariate F, t, χ²) that allowed the computation of a correlation coefficient with the formulas provided by Hunter and Schmidt (2004). Results that only reported multivariate models were excluded. Second, only those studies that measured constructs at the firm level were included. Third, studies were considered independent only when they reported correlation coefficients from different samples. So the results based on data used in other studies that were already included were excluded. Upon completion of the literature retrieval procedures, the authors obtained a total of 119 effect sizes reported in 42 studies. The complete collection of studies is summarized in the appendix.

To reduce coding error, the authors prepared a coding protocol specifying the information to be extracted from each study. The coding form was prepared.

# Data-Analysis

The authors conducted this meta-analysis according to the guidelines provided by Hunter and Schmidt (2004). First of all, we converted the reported statistics into a common effect size. To account for the skewness of the distribution of sample correlation coefficients, we transformed the correlation into Fisher’s z coefficients with the formula *y = 0.5 × logi (1 + ri)/(1 - ri). Then the authors averaged and weighted the z coefficients by the formula Vi = 1/(N - 3)*.

There are two general models: the fixed-effects model and the random-effects model. The fixed-effects meta-analysis assumes the population effect sizes are equal for all studies, so the differences on the observed effect sizes are due to sampling error. As for the random-effects model, the population effect sizes can be different across studies (Hedges & Vevea, 1998). The differences on the observed effect sizes are due to a combination of true difference (variance component) and sampling error. It is usually preferred methodologically. The authors conducted a homogeneity test with the R package to determine whether a fixed- or random-effects model should be used. Under the assumption of homogeneity (H0: β1 = β2 = β3 = ... = βk), the test statistic Q has a chi-square distribution with df = (No. of studies − 1). In the authors’ database, Q is equal to 275.3655 (df = 118, p < .001); thus, we rejected the null hypothesis that all effect sizes are equal. For this reason, the authors chose the random-effects model to conduct this meta-analysis.

# Table 1

summarizes the number of effect sizes, cumulative sample sizes, corrected correlations, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals around the corrected correlations for each pairwise relationship. Providing support for Hypothesis 1, the authors obtained a significant, positive correlation for the relationship between CSR and CFP (r = .0587, p < .001). In addition, the results report the I2 index, which is interpreted as the proportion of total variation due to heterogeneity between studies (Higgins & Thompson, 2002). As a rule of thumb, I2 of 25%, 50%, and 75% can be considered as low, moderate, and high heterogeneity. In the study database, I2 is equal to 73.65%, which means that a high degree of heterogeneity exists among the conclusions on the relationships between CSR and CFP. A further investigation on the moderating effects on this relationship will be discussed in detail in the subsequent sections.

Furthermore, the authors examined the causal direction between CSR and CFP. As shown in the second line of Table 1, the instrumental stakeholder theory is supported by the primary studies. The corrected coefficient between prior CSR and subsequent CFP is equal to .0319 (p < .001, N = 39,913), which means Hypothesis 2a is supported. However, the slack resources theory has not been supported. The positive association between prior CFP and subsequent CSR is not significant in this meta-analysis. Concurrent studies facilitate a positive corrected coefficient, which is equal to .0678 (p < .001, N = 125,085).

# Sensitivity Analysis

Although the meta-analysis is very powerful, it is not without problems. The file drawer problem is known as a publication bias. Nonsignificant findings are less likely to be submitted and accepted for publication. So the published findings are more likely to be significant than unpublished findings. In this study, the authors conducted a file drawer analysis to get the number of unpublished papers with null effect required to neutralize the average effect. As shown in the last column of Table 1, it will require 7,369 unpublished studies with null effect to subvert the positive relationship between CSR and CFP. The cross-sectional result is also robust, which requires 5,218 unpublished studies to challenge the positive results. As suggested by Rosenthal (1991), the file drawer tolerance is set at 5X + 10, where X = number of studies. Although the fail-safe number on the relationship between prior CSR and subsequent CFP is just 262, it is more than sufficient for the tolerance level (70).

# Results

To investigate the moderating effect of different measurement strategies on the relationship between CSR and CFP, the authors divided all the samples into five subgroups based on the operationalizations of CSR and three subgroups based on the operationalizations of CFP. The authors followed the guidelines provided by Viechtbauer (2010) to conduct a QM test to examine the moderate effects. QM test based on the levels of a categorical moderator is a frequent practice in meta-analyses (Viechtbauer, 2010). The value of QM is equal to 151.1894 (p < .0001, df = 5), which indicates that the different types of operationalizations of CSR are significantly moderating the relationship between CSR and CFP. In other words, the relationships based on different measurement strategies of CSR are significantly different (see Table 2).

Specifically, for the 25 effect sizes that use reputation ratings, the corrected r is .0251 (p = .0572). Twenty effect sizes examined CSR by content analysis, but the corrected r is not significant (r = .0181, p = .4293). This result might be related to the problems of a methodological nature raised by Abbott and Monsen (1979). When content analysis is employed, it is necessary to formulate a set of categories and code the raw data in terms of the categories. Then, two types of problems are possible. First, the formulation of categories that do not reflect all the issues actually contained in the report. Second, the raw data may be inaccurately coded in terms of the selected categories (Abbott & Monsen, 1975). These shortcomings of content analysis might cause the differences in CSR measurements and facilitate the heterogenic relationship between CSR and CFP.

For 32 effect sizes using surveys, the corrected r is .1427 (p < .0001). This result indicated that the relationship measured by surveys is the largest effect. On one hand, it is because this method has the advantage of construct validity. On the other hand, the authors cannot deny the problem of common method bias overestimating the relationship.

A growing number of studies examine CSR by using an independent social auditing database. The corrected r is equal to .0405 (p < .0001). The 10 effect sizes that rely on a proxy variable to assess CSR reveal a corrected r of .0372 (p < .0001). Taken together, these results suggest that the relationship between CSR and CFP is positive across all different kinds of measurement strategies.

Table 3 indicates that the association between CSR and CFP depends on the researchers’ operational definition of CFP. Same as the procedure mentioned before, the authors conducted a QM test. The result shows a significant moderating effect of the CFP operationalization. QM = 115.4095 (p < .0001, df = 3) supports the view that differences in previous findings resulted from study manipulation. Across all the three measurement strategies, the relationship between CSR and CFP is significantly positive. Particularly, the perceptual measures (r = .1852, p < .0001) are more highly correlated with CSR than accounting and market-based CFP. Seventy-one effect sizes collected financial data based on the accounting measurement, and the corrected r is equal to .0489 (p < .0001), which is a little bit higher than the market-based measurement (r = .0378, p < .0001).

Hypothesis 5 stated that the relationship between CSR and CFP is stronger for firms from advanced economies than for firms from developing economies. To test this predication, the authors separated the original studies into two categories: studies based on data obtained from advanced economies and studies based on data from developing economies. The authors

followed a UN classification for this categorization (Nachum, 2004). The QM is equal to 51.5369 (p < .0001), presenting a significant moderating effect for this contingency factor. The studies’ results based on data from advanced economies yield stronger effect sizes than those obtained from developing economies (r = .0404 vs. r = .0175, respectively). Meanwhile, the statistical power is different between the developed and developing countries. For the studies based in the developing countries, the p value is significant at the level of .1. However, it is significant at the level of .001 for the samples from the developed countries. Therefore, Hypothesis 5 is supported (see Table 4).

# Discussion

The relationship between CSR and CFP has been extensively studied in strategic and organizational management, yet the empirical findings on its importance have been noticeably mixed. The authors conducted a meta-analytic review to seek to clarify this issue. Drawing on several theoretical perspectives regarding instrumental stakeholder theory, RBV, and reputation theory, this study reviews the linkage of CSR–CFP at the organizational level and answers the following questions: (a) whether CSR is positively linked to financial performance; (b) and if so, in what direction does the causation run; and (c) whether methodological and contextual heterogeneities moderate CSR–CFP linkage.

The results of this study make several contributions to the literature on the value of CSR. First, based on 42 studies and 119 effect sizes, an integration correlation revealed a positive association of CSR–CFP linkage, thus answering positively the question: Do firms “do well by doing good”? This question has been invoked as the primary concern of the management literature on CSR (McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright 2006). Showing that a firm does well by doing good is often referred to as making the business case for CSR (McWilliams & Siegel, 2006). Therefore, understanding whether CSR is effective in facilitating organizational performance is not only important to researchers but also financially meaningful to practitioners who have been practicing or are being advised to practice social involvement. As a compilation of previous findings cannot produce a definitive conclusion, Margolis and Walsh (2003) argued that “the CSP-CFP empirical literature reinforces, rather than relieves the tension surrounding corporate responses to social misery” (p. 278). The findings drawn from this meta-analysis thus provide some indication that prior literature, in aggregate, indicates a positive relationship between CSR and CFP, which is supposed to be beneficial to clarifying the mystery.

Second, this research adds to the existing concerns on the antecedents of CSR behavior. There are many factors, found in the past 30 years of research, potentially influencing a firm’s social involvement. Without a comprehensive consideration of those factors, it may be hard to say that any one of them, such as financial performance, positively caused subsequent CSR. As stated above, the study results did not support the slack resource theory, which assumed that firms with good prior financial performance would be associated with a higher degree of subsequent social responsibility. The authors believe that this result may be related to the diverse and complex predictions determining companies’ social responsibility. For the past 30 years of research, a great number of scholars have discussed, from exogenous and endogenous perspectives, the antecedents of CSR. Government requirements, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), developing status, and social security are viewed as external antecedents of social-level factors. One source of endogenous influences are firm-level factors, such as CFP (Aupperle et al., 1985; McGuire et al., 1988; Moskowitz, 1972), firm strategy (Berman et al., 1999), business exposure (Miles, 1987), political participation level (Wu, 2006), and institutional ownership (Hansen & Hill, 1991). Another type of endogenous factor focuses on the individual factors, for instance, managers’ demographic characteristics, managerial value, and CEO power (Hambrick & Finkelstein, 1987; Hambrick & Mason, 1984).

This viewpoint gets support to a certain extent from Mishina, Dykes, Block, and Pollock (2010). Arguing that “good firms do bad things,” they found that high firm accounting performance is positively related to the likelihood that a firm engages in corporate illegality, and this likelihood being due to a lot of pressure to maintain high relative performance that may induce risk-seeking behaviors. Recent history illustrates the complexity of this issue. Many of the firms involved in corporate scandals, such as Arthur Andersen, Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and several leading investment banks, were generally viewed as high-performing companies until their scandals were uncovered (Mishina et al., 2010).

Third, this study also contributes to the literature on CSR by demonstrating how measurement strategy and environmental context may explain the heterogeneity of CSR–CFP linkage. The meta-analytic correlations indicate that the association between CSR and CFP depends on the researcher’s operational definition of each construct. Overall, the findings with respect to CSR operationalizations suggest that the relationship measured by surveys produces the strongest effect compared with the other four types of CSR measurements. Meanwhile, content analysis appears to have an insignificant impact on CFP. Market-based measures of CFP were less highly correlated.

# Business & Society

with CSR than accounting and perceptual measures. In that sense, two theoretical implications are noteworthy. On one hand, CSR is a multidimensional construct, which has yet to contribute a few pieces of puzzle in its definition and measurement among previous studies. As discussed above, many measures have been used in empirical research on CSR. The great disparity of CSR measures has made it very difficult for research to cumulate. As Wood and Jones (1995) pointed out,

measures are developed for certain purposes—say, to test for a statistical link between corporate social responsibility and financial performance such as ROI—and they may not be readily transferrable to other purposes, such as the development of a general theory of corporate social performance. (p. 240)

The meta-analytic result of high correlation between CFP and CSR measured by survey is consistent with Wood and Jones’s point. However, some scholars have begun to move toward a new theory of the firm—a stakeholder theory—that would permit a better understanding of CSR. According to Freeman (1984), the main founder of stakeholder theory, stakeholder indicates groups and organizations that are affected by or can affect a company’s operations. Stakeholders are not unitary, which serve a single function for a firm; rather, they engage in many different behaviors with respect to the firm, while filling several critical roles. Within a stakeholder-based theoretical perspective, CSR is a way for firms to engage more fully in their societal relationships and duties (Wood & Jones, 1995). The insignificant integrated results based on content analysis, in this meta-analysis, also show that a comprehensive and complex framework is essential to evaluate CSR. Therefore, the authors suggest that stakeholder theory is the most relevant theoretical framework for assessing corporate social performance.

On the other hand, the meta-analytic outcomes support the view that differences in previous studies resulted from “stakeholder mismatching.” As Wood and Jones (1995) argued, different stakeholders might differently set expectations, experience the effects, and evaluate the outcomes for a particular measure of corporate performance. Multiple stakeholders can be involved in different ways in a single instance of firm behavior. Hence, the ambiguous results are largely due to studies not choosing variables and predicting relationships that would be appropriate within a stakeholder/CSR framework. The meta-analysis supports the Orlitzky et al. (2003) suggestion that capital market participants dismiss certain concrete behavioral measures of CSR, because there is no theory to explain why stockholders would buy a company’s stock for its high-level donation.

# Wang et al.

Moreover, incorporating multiple moderators allows for a comprehensive understanding of the contextual contingencies between CSR and CFP. In recent studies, scholars have argued that socially responsible corporate behavior varied across countries and appealed for more attention to a cross-national comparison (Campbell, 2007). But for the shortage of multinational data, the comparative research based on different background is still rare. However, meta-analysis can overcome this issue to a certain extent by integrating empirical results across diverse contexts. More specifically, by including market development and institutional environment as a contextual moderator, the authors found the relationship between CSR and CFP to vary significantly within different operational environments. This finding provides insight for cross-cultural research and practical implication for multinational firms.

Future studies should explore the macro-level and societal factors that may moderate this relationship. Macro-level variables, such as the munificence of natural resources, relative wealth, and the type of government and its stability, help vary the CSR–CFP link. Societal moderators, such as religion, historic traditions, and moral culture, also influence this relationship (Robertson & Crittenden, 2003). This meta-analysis result also provided some strategic implications for multinational firms. Corporate managers are mindful of the fact that business norms and standards, regulatory frameworks, and stakeholder demands for CSR can vary substantially across nations and regions (McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006). If multinational firms fail to concern about local ethical norms pursued by cross-cultural alliance partners, distributors, suppliers, customers, financiers, and foreign government agencies, they may come across public relations disasters.

The present study is also subject to a number of limitations. First, although the authors have conducted a file drawer analysis to examine the publication bias, the authors could not perfectly solve this problem. Among the 42 studies, most are from journals, and only 1 is a doctoral dissertation. The authors have done their best to search for studies with a wide range of resources, but the file drawer problem is still a key shortcoming of a meta-analysis. Second, as previous research mentioned, the relationship between CSR and CFP varies significantly with the different characteristics of firms and their operational environments (H. Wang & Qian, 2011). In this study, the authors have investigated the moderating effects of measurement strategies and environmental factors. But, for the shortage of relative data, firm-level moderators and other potential moderators, which might explain the variance across studies, have not been identified and examined, warranting further research in the future.

# Conclusion

CSR studies have improved over time with stronger theoretical rationales, more relevant operationalizations, and more and better controls for previously omitted variables, “yet the improved rigor has only produced rigor mortis” (Barnett, 2007, p. 796). Even after three decades of research, differences in perspective have only accumulated, not dissipated, thereby further obscuring the big picture (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). The meta-analytic review, together with extensive discussions and future research suggestions, may furnish a reference for further theory development, research design, and empirical analysis in the field. The authors hope that this review clarifies and solidifies scholarly knowledge of CSR and its value in enhancing financial performance.

Synthesizing research findings of 42 empirical studies on the linkage between CSR and financial performance, this study endorses the prevalent argument that CSR enhances CFP. Furthermore, the authors explored the direction of the causation. The authors found that subsequent financial performance is positively associated with prior social responsibility, in support of the instrumental stakeholder theory. That theory suggests that firms can “do well by doing good.” However, the reverse direction is not supported in this study. That is, the evidence suggests that prior high level of financial performance has virtually no significant effect on firms’ subsequent social involvement.

The results of subgroup analyses confirmed the authors’ propositions that the heterogeneity of the CSR and CFP relationship may result from the measurement strategies of the two key constructs of CSR and CFP. The empirical evidence implies that the relationship measured by surveys produces the strongest effect compared with the other four types of CSR measurements. Another subgroup analysis based on different operational measures of CFP shows that the perceptual measures are more highly correlated with CSR than accounting and market-based CFP. The final set analysis examined the moderating effects of environmental context on the CSR and CFP relationship. The results show that the relationship between CSR and CFP is stronger for firms from advanced economies than for firms from developing economies.

# Note

1. These five journals are chosen for two reasons. They are either ranked as the top journals in the area of management or mainly focus on corporate social responsibility (CSR). The authors also tried to include Business & Society (BAS), which has a high impact factor (1.936 in 2012), but BAS focuses on relatively wide-spread topics besides CSR, such as corporate governance, and business–government relations. So the authors did not conduct a manual search on it, but some papers on CSR–CFP (corporate financial performance) from BAS are included in the meta-analysis.

# Abstract

Almost every few decades, there is an innovation that completely changes the world. We mean innovations that play a vital role in raising the standard of living, such as the internet or airplanes. What will be the next definitive moment in history? It's here, and it's called Chat GPT. It was created by the artificial intelligence research firm Open AI. ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) model that combines GPT-2, a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI, with supervised and reinforcement learning techniques to fine-tune it (an approach to transfer learning) on the GPT-3 group of large language patterns developed by OpenAI. The model enables users to interact naturally with an AI system through text-based conversations. It could be used for customer service applications and to create virtual assistants for voice and text conversations. ChatGPT also provides features such as topic detection, emotion detection, and sentiment analysis capabilities to help users understand their conversation partner better. Additionally, it has the capability to generate multiple conversation threads in order to create more realistic interactions between user and bot. We will also explore some of the challenges facing AI development and how we can overcome them. This article is about the recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). AI has advanced significantly over recent years, with a wide range of applications and new technologies being developed. And discuss a few of these advancements and use to improve human lives. In this paper, we discuss how ChatGPT - a Natural Language Generation (NLG) model powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 technology - can enhance e-commerce via chat, as well as other sectors such as education, entertainment, finance, health, news and productivity. We will analyze the current use-cases of ChatGPT in these sectors and explore possible future applications. We will also discuss how this technology can use to create more personalized content for users. Finally, we will look at how ChatGPT can help to make customer service more efficient and effective for businesses.

This revolutionary platform utilizes natural language processing (NLP)[2] and machine learning (ML) algorithms[2] to enable users to communicate with machines in a conversational manner. It has recently been introduced to the public with great fanfare and promises to revolutionize how people interact with technology. With their ability to comprehend context, intent, sentiment, and more, ChatGPT enables users of all ages and backgrounds to communicate naturally in a variety of languages without having any prior knowledge or experience in programming or computer science. It may be used for many things, like customer service, entertainment, education, finance, health care, and more.

ChatGPT offers numerous advancements over traditional bots or voice assistants currently available on the market. For instance, it has advanced capabilities such as understanding context from conversations, which enables it to respond more accurately than most existing solutions. This helps reduce errors and improve the user experience when interacting with systems powered by ChatGPT. The introduction of this new technology will have far-reaching implications for society as a whole, from education systems being able to leverage AI-powered tutoring services that can provide personalized teaching assistance tailored specifically for each student’s needs; entertainment experiences becoming more interactive through virtual assistants capable of understanding user preferences; financial institutions providing customers with automated advice on investment decisions based on their individual risk profiles; healthcare providers offering smarter patient care solutions utilizing predictive analytics tools that can detect patterns in medical data faster than humans ever could—these are just some examples where ChatGPT could be used beneficially across different industries and sectors.

Additionally, its ability [1] to understand complex questions allows for efficient information retrieval, which could prove invaluable in areas like healthcare where accurate diagnosis of patients is essential. Furthermore, its open-source nature makes it easily customizable, giving developers flexibility when creating applications that leverage ChatGPT’s powerful capabilities.

In addition, there are numerous potential applications outside the realm of business too, from providing real-time news updates customized according to people's interests to helping individuals stay organized at home through intelligent task management software—the possibilities seem endless when it [3] comes to leveraging this powerful AI toolset within our daily lives! Ultimately though, what really matters here is not only its technical capabilities but also how we use them responsibly so as not to cause any harm either directly or indirectly—something that should be taken into serious consideration going forward if we want to maximize our success rate when introducing such advanced technologies into society moving forward.

The introduction of ChatGPT presents us with many opportunities that can help society progress further while improving lives across multiple sectors such as education, entertainment, finance, health news, and productivity. In the education sector, students would benefit from being able to answer their queries quickly through conversation rather than searching online. Similarly, doctors could leverage this technology for faster diagnosis and treatment plans tailored specifically towards each patient's needs. A virtual assistant powered by ChatGPT will be [3] able to provide better recommendations based on the user's preferences, allowing them to discover new content they may enjoy watching or listening to without having to manually search for it; companies in the finance sector will have access to real-time data analysis, allowing them to make decisions faster while staying up to date on the latest trends in their respective markets.[2] Finally, apps that use GPT-enabled chatbots allow employees to complete tasks more efficiently because they no longer need to spend time navigating complicated menus and can instead ask the bot directly what they need to get the job done. All of these advancements show just a few of the ways that incorporating GPT into our daily lives improves the quality of life for both current and future generations.

# 3. METHODOLOGY OF CHATGPT

ChatGPT is a new technology for natural language processing (NLP) that could change the way conversational AI works. It combines deep learning, reinforcement learning, and transfer learning to make chatbots that can act like humans. The goal of ChatGPT is to make it possible for machines to understand what people say and respond in a natural way. In this paper, we discuss the methodology behind ChatGPT and how it works in detail. At its core, ChatGPT uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, which lets it learn from previous conversations and contextual information about each conversation topic or context provided by the user's input sentence(s). This makes it possible to make more correct predictions than with the rule-based methods used by chatbots like ELIZA or AIML. Also, unlike these rule-based approaches, which are limited by the size of their preprogrammed knowledge bases, RNN architectures can be trained on large datasets, such as those available through open source projects like OpenAI Gpt2 or Google's BERT model and can be scaled up almost indefinitely. The most important part of training is to use reinforcement learning techniques along with supervised machine translation models like the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model in the Google Translate API. By using both of these training methods at the same time, ChatGPT can quickly learn new ideas based on what users say while also adapting to the different situations in each conversation thread. During training, when these two methods are used together, ChatGPT can quickly learn new ideas based on what the user says while also being able to adapt to different situations in each conversation thread. Also, skills that could be used in more than one area can be learned in one area. This makes this method very scalable over time. Lastly, because it can come up with useful answers even when given incomplete sentences, it's a great fit for real-world applications where people might not always give their virtual assistants or chatbots all the information they need up front but still want helpful answers back.

Its closest competitor is Microsoft Bing, which holds around 7% of total worldwide searches, while Yahoo! and other smaller players such as DuckDuckGo make up only a small fraction at 2%. Google has a 99%+ market share in the mobile market because its Android operating system comes pre-installed on most phones sold around the world today.

In comparison to other browsers like Mozilla Firefox or Apple Safari, these have much lower usage when compared against Chrome (the browser developed by Google). Statcounter Global Stats data from October 2020 shows that 69% of users were on Chrome, 14% on Safari, 6% on Edge/IE, 4% on FireFox, and 1% on Opera. It's clear that people like Chrome because it works faster than other browsers and has easy-access features like saving passwords. This is helpful for people who are always on the go or need quick access on multiple devices at the same time without having to log into each one individually. With this kind of advantage over competing products, it’s no surprise why Chrome continues to dominate the browser industry despite fierce competition from rivals like Firefox and Edge/IE.

Overall, Google's products (Google Search and Chrome) have the most market share in both the search engine [23] market and the browser market. This gives Google an edge over competitors like Microsoft Bing.

Yahoo!, etc. Google will definitely stay at the top of this field for a long time as long as it keeps coming up with new solutions that meet users' needs.

# 26. THE FUTURE OF SEARCH ENGINES COULD BE DOMINATED BY OPENAI CHATGPT

Microsoft Open AI’s ChatGPT is an innovative technology which has the potential [24] to revolutionize how people search for information online. This advanced artificial intelligence system uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand user queries and provide accurate answers quickly. Unlike traditional [25] search engines, which rely on keywords, ChatGPT can interpret conversational questions posed in natural language, making it easier for users to find what they are looking for without having to use exact phrases or terms. Additionally, this technology has the ability to learn from its interactions with users over time so that it can better anticipate their needs and offer more relevant results, as well as personalized recommendations based on previous searches. The introduction of Microsoft Open AI's ChatGPT could potentially change the way [25] we use search engines in our everyday lives by providing a much more efficient experience when seeking out information online. With its ability to understand complex queries expressed in plain English instead of relying solely on keyword matching techniques like current search engine technologies do today, we will be able to see improved accuracy when searching through large amounts of data faster than ever before while also receiving personalized results tailored specifically towards us individually each time, we query something new! Outcome [] of the advancements enabled by Microsoft OpenAI's chatGPT technology, there is no doubt that this will have significant implications both now and in the future market, where ChatGPT may become commonplace in many aspects of life, such as education or business operations, among others! Not only does this mean increased convenience, but also greater accessibility too since anyone, regardless if they know coding languages or not, would be able to utilize these tools effectively, thus paving the way for even further innovation across multiple sectors around the world wide web itself!

# 27. CHATGPT IN 2050: A FUTURE VISION

In 2050, chat GPT will be an integral part of communication. It'll be the go-to tool for businesses, organizations, and even individuals to quickly interact with computers and get high-quality, meaningful results. Chat GPT will enable users to converse naturally in both text and voice formats with AI bots that understand them. This technology will enable real-time conversations about any topic imaginable—from ordering food or booking tickets to discussing complicated topics like quantum mechanics. Chat GPT will also dramatically reduce the cost of providing customer service by automating many tasks that otherwise require manual labor. Moreover, it'll be highly customizable, so it can suit different contexts and provide more personalized interactions with users. The possibilities are endless—chat GPT could revolutionize how we interact with computers in the future!

# 28. CONCLUSION

The impact of AI-based chatbot technology, such as ChatGPT, on several business sectors has been revolutionary. In particular, these bots have had a positive effect on digital marketing and e-commerce operations. They are able to quickly process customer inquiries and provide personalized responses based on the data they collect from customers. This helps businesses build stronger relationships with their customers while also increasing sales conversions in the long run. Additionally, ChatGPT has made its mark

in healthcare by providing automated patient support services that can reduce costs for providers while improving outcomes for patients through better diagnosis accuracy and faster response times to medical questions or concerns. Similarly, it is being used by educational institutions to assist students with course material or answer general queries about university life more efficiently than before, which allows them to focus more time on other areas of importance like research projects or teaching activities instead of mundane administrative tasks that could be automated using a chatbot system like ChatGPT’s AI platform with their customers while also increasing sales conversions in the long run.

Lastly, financial organizations are taking advantage of what it could do. Banks use it as a way for customers to interact with their accounts without having to go to a branch, and insurance companies use it to evaluate claims faster than ever before, among other things.

In conclusion, there is no doubt that the implementation of artificial intelligence-driven solutions such as those provided by Chat GPT into various business sectors has revolutionized how organizations operate today. By providing them with access to powerful automation tools that enable faster processing times as well as improved efficiency levels across all departments, these technologies provide significant competitive advantages over traditional methods, which may soon become obsolete if not already so due to their poor performance when compared to what modern-day AIs can do now. Then, it's easy to see why so many organizations choose to use this kind of technology in their daily operations: doing so has a lot of potential financial and operational benefits. Human input and software like web browsers can aid in creating AI that is dependable, accurate, and practical for many purposes. The system has difficulty with tough or strange situations, but still shows great improvement in this area. The bot is mostly trained on data up to 2021, so newer events may still need to be found by the chat GPT. Simple requests, like asking about the date and time, cannot be handled by it, as it lacks contextual understanding. Though AI models can offer realistic solutions to certain issues, their accuracy may be questionable since they are still in development.

In order to conclude that CSP has a positive effect on CFP it is necessary that the meta-analysis statistics establish a positive association between CSP and CFP. However, this is not sufficient. It is also necessary to investigate the existence of selection and specification effects.

The association between genuine and observed partial correlations can be expressed as:

r0 = f(rg, S, p, u)

where rg denotes the genuine partial correlation between CSP and financial performance, S is the systematic specification impact, p denotes publication bias, and u represents random specification differences.

The observed partial correlation r0 is not observed and must be inferred from the available literature. However, it is well known that study outcomes potentially distort the estimates of rg based on the population of published studies. Meta-regression analysis can be used to identify the impact of specification differences on the reported CSP-CFP relationships.

Publication bias involves the estimation of a less subjective approach to the analysis of meta-significance model (MST). Stanley (2001) recommends estimating the following regression:

Infti = &beta;0 + &alpha;ln(dfi) + &epsilon;

where ti and dfi denote the t-statistic and degrees of freedom from study i, respectively. The logic behind this test is simple. As sample size rises, the precision of the estimate rises also, and hence, t-statistics also rise. Stanley et al. (2004) show that the slope coefficient in equation (2) offers information on the existence of genuine empirical effects, publication bias, or both: If &alpha; < 0, there is a genuine association between CSP and CFP. If &alpha; > 0, the literature is contaminated by selection effects, or publication bias.

Our second concern is the existence and impact of specification bias. It is well known that study effects. Meta-analysis offers an excellent vehicle for detecting the impact of specification differences (Stanley 2001). In this paper we explore the impact of specification bias through the estimation of two meta-regression analysis models (MRA). The first MRA involves estimation of a general meta-regression model of the form:

SnKin + 01Bil + . + OmBim + u; Toi = 0 + YiXil + YkXik + 81Kil + . + (3)

The second MRA is an extension of the MST, combining specification differences with meta-significance analysis (known as MSTM-RA): This involves incorporating MRA with MST models, and hence, involves the estimation of a general MST model, that investigates the existence of a genuine union-profit effect, after controlling for specification and data differences:

In t = do + &1lndf; + 02Zi + &;

Equation 4 is basically an extension of Stanley (2001) to include MRA variables.

# Board Characteristics and Corporate Social Responsibility: A Meta-Analytic Investigation

# Jan Endrikat1,2, Charl de Villiers3,4, Thomas W. Guenther2, and Edeltraud M. Guenther2,5

# Abstract

Boards of directors affect corporate strategy and decision-making through monitoring of management and resource provision. Recently, an increasing number of studies have examined the relationships between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR). These studies have yielded inconsistent findings. This article therefore reports the results of a study applying meta-analytical techniques to a sample of 82 empirical studies to help clarify the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. Although prior research has tended to apply relatively simplistic models investigating the impact of individual board characteristics independently and only directly, we adopt a more complex perspective to shed new light on the board characteristics–CSR nexus. Specifically, we use a meta-analytic path model that accounts for the potential interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and tests whether the presence of a CSR.

committee plays a mediating role. Our findings suggest that board size, board independence, and female board representation are partially interrelated with each other and jointly influence CSR directly as well as indirectly via the presence of a CSR committee. In addition, we find that country-level institutional factors act as moderators and that the relationships differ with regard to the specific dimension of CSR (i.e., social, environmental, or aggregate).

The relationships between corporate board characteristics and firm performance are well researched in the strategic management and corporate governance literature. From an agency theory perspective, boards serve a monitoring function to ensure the alignment of managerial actions with shareholder interests (Fama & Jensen, 1983), reducing agency costs that may arise when managers pursue their own interests at the expense of shareholders. Resource dependence theory (RDT) highlights another function of the board, namely, the provision of access to resources, such as knowledge and networks, critical to firms’ success (Hillman et al., 2000; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Hillman and Dalziel (2003) suggest that both monitoring and resource provision determine the association between board characteristics and firm performance.

While most studies concerned with board characteristics and firm performance focus on financial performance, recently several scholars have investigated the association between board characteristics and corporate social responsibility (CSR), a nonfinancial dimension of firm performance (de Villiers et al., 2011; Walls et al., 2012). CSR has become increasingly prevalent and visible within firms as a mechanism to cope with stakeholder demands and to manage societal expectations beyond firms’ financial aims (H. Wang et al., 2016). Evolving from a long-standing debate about firms’ responsibilities toward society and from an enormous body of empirical work concerned with the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance, the business case perspective increasingly prevails (i.e., the view that CSR enables firms to enhance their competitive advantage and that firms benefit from CSR in terms of financial performance, Carroll & Shabana, 2010). Recent studies (Eccles et al., 2014; Surroca et al., 2010), as well as earlier meta-analyses (Orlitzky et al., 2003), suggest a positive association.

between CSR and corporate financial performance. CSR is deemed to create firm value by providing better access to valuable resources (Waddock & Graves, 1997), attracting high-quality employees (Turban & Greening, 1997), increasing customer value of products and services (Peloza & Shang, 2011), and enabling the development of intangible assets (Hull & Rothenberg, 2008). Consequently, CSR can be seen as a strategic imperative and an increasing number of investors consider CSR in their decision-making (Khan et al., 2016). In view of the strategic importance of CSR and given the decisive role that boards play in corporate strategy and decision-making processes (Kassinis & Vafeas, 2002; Tang et al., 2015), it is important to fully consider reliable scientific evidence regarding the board characteristics associated with superior CSR.

However, the available empirical evidence regarding these relationships is difficult to assess for at least three reasons. First, different studies provide conflicting evidence. For example, Walls and colleagues (2012) find a negative relationship between the number of directors and the environmental dimension of CSR and concluded that smaller boards “[. . .] can mitigate detrimental environmental performance more effectively” (p. 901), whereas Post and colleagues (2011) find a positive relationship between the same constructs, leading them to conclude that “[. . .] having more directors provides boards with more information about environmental issues (rather than the opposite argument that board size leads to chaos and inaction) [. . .]” (p. 211). Similarly, Galbreath (2016) reports a negative relationship between CEO–chair duality (i.e., a CEO that also serves as the chairman of the board) and CSR, whereas Ferrero-Ferrero and colleagues (2015) do not find a significant relationship. Such conflicting empirical results undermine the establishment of credible scientific generalizations, impeding advances in managerial practice and regulatory reform.

Second, while studies examine various aspects such as board size, the number of outside directors, or CEO–chair duality and their relationships with CSR, most of them examine the board characteristics in isolation. Thus, while theoretically self-evident, little is known about whether, and how, certain board characteristics may interact with each other in their relationships with CSR (Galbreath, 2016; Oh et al., 2018; Rao & Tilt, 2016). In this vein, Jain and Jamali (2016) conclude from their review on corporate governance and CSR that future research needs to “[. . .] rethink CG [corporate governance] mechanisms as bundles rather than piecemeal” (p. 266). Moreover, prior empirical studies employ overly simplistic models that only investigate direct relationships while potential mediating mechanisms have been neglected. Finally, as CSR is becoming increasingly prevalent on a global scale and while several studies have begun to explore relationships between board characteristics and CSR in different institutional contexts.

settings (Chang et al., 2017; Young & Thyil, 2014), we have limited knowledge about whether different legal and sociocultural contexts determine the focal relationships. Finally, CSR constitutes a multidimensional construct encompassing a range of aspects, such as employee relations, philanthropy, and environmental performance (Walls et al., 2012; H. Wang et al., 2016), which can be grouped into social and environmental dimensions. However, to date, no quantitative review has investigated the (potentially) different relationships between the social versus the environmental dimension of CSR and board characteristics.

To address and shed light on these issues, we draw on meta-analytic methods to further develop and refine the understanding of the relationship between board characteristics and CSR. Based on the available evidence from prior studies, we examine the relationships between CSR and board size, board independence, female board representation, CEO–chair duality, and the existence of a CSR committee. First, we quantitatively synthesize existing empirical research on the relationships between these board characteristics and CSR by means of random-effects meta-analysis. Second, we specify and test a meta-analytic path model to examine the interplay between board characteristics in determining CSR and to investigate whether the presence of a CSR committee plays a mediating role. Third, we explore potential moderating effects by using meta-analytic regression analysis.

Our study aims to make three contributions to the literature. First, in terms of an empirical contribution, we clarify the direction and strength of the relationships between certain board characteristics and CSR, drawing on cumulative data allowing us to provide more definitive answers than those reported in any single primary study. In particular, our analysis is based on 82 studies providing us with correlations based on a total of 167,317 firm-year observations. Thus, first, we resolve the uncertainties raised in the narrative review of Jain and Jamali (2016), by providing aggregated, generalized evidence regarding the relationships between CSR and the most widely empirically examined board characteristics; second, we move beyond Byron and Post’s (2016) focus on women on boards. While we find that board size, board independence, female board representation, and the presence of a CSR committee are positively related to CSR, we do not find a significant relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR.

Second, we make a theoretical contribution and advance the literature by hypothesizing and testing a model that (a) accounts for the likely interrelatedness of board characteristics and their joint influence on CSR and (b) incorporates the potential mediating role of the presence of a CSR committee. Hence, we add to the recent literature that applies a more holistic approach.

# Endrikat et al.

and seek to uncover more complex relationships that might be at play in promoting CSR (Aguilera et al., 2012; Jain & Jamali, 2016; Oh et al., 2018).

Third, our article also contributes to theory refinement by showing that country-level factors, as well as the specific dimensions of CSR, moderate the focal relationships. In particular, we provide evidence that investor protection strength moderates the relationships between board size and CSR and between board independence and CSR. We ascribe these results to countries’ investor protection substituting for these board-level influences. Moreover, we find that a country’s level of gender parity moderates the relationship between female board representation and CSR, specifically that countries’ gender parity complements (or amplifies) the effect of female board representation on CSR. Those aspects can be hardly explored by primary studies due to data collection constraints (Jeong & Harrison, 2017). Our findings in this regard establish some boundary conditions on the analyzed relationships and highlight the importance of taking into account macro-contextual factors when studying the relationship between board characteristics and CSR.

Finally, our results show that the particular dimension of CSR that is examined (i.e., environmental vs. social dimension) influences board characteristics–CSR relationships. Hence, we add to the growing stream of research that acknowledges the multidimensional nature of CSR and thus seeks to provide a more nuanced understanding of organizational commitment to society (H. Wang et al., 2016). In sum, our study is valuable both for advancing the academic discussion on the relationships between board characteristics and CSR, and for informing business and regulatory practice.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. First, we introduce the constructs used in our meta-analytic examinations and draw on theoretical arguments and prior empirical evidence to derive our hypotheses. Subsequently, we describe our procedures for the identification and coding of the primary studies and outline our methods of analysis. After having presented our findings, we discuss them and conclude with a review of contributions, limitations, and directions for future research.

# Theoretical Background and Hypotheses

# Construct Definitions and Theoretical Overview

Although several theoretical frameworks have been used to posit links between particular board characteristics and CSR, the relationships between board characteristics and CSR that we examine can be theorized using either agency theory–related arguments, resource provision arguments, or a combination of both. For example, although feminist ethics theories (Boulouta,

2013; Slote, 2007) may inform us about the specific characteristics of female directors, ultimately those characteristics constitute resources (including capabilities and perspectives) that female directors bring into the boardroom, and therefore, the influence of female directors on CSR can be argued and explained by referring to resource dependence theory (Jeong & Harrison, 2017). Agency theory posits that directors serve as agents of firms’ shareholders and play a monitoring role to ensure that managers act in the interest of shareholders, as the owners of the firm (Fama & Jensen, 1983). Vigilant directors can reduce agency costs (Hillman & Dalziel, 2003) and ensure appropriate processes of strategy development and formulation (McNulty & Pettigrew, 1999). RDT, however, emphasizes directors’ role in providing firms with access to resources (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978) such as networks, knowledge and insight, advice and counsel, legitimacy, and communication channels between the firm and external organizations and parties (Hillman & Dalziel, 2003). Furthermore, directors’ expertise and their access to expanded networks provide reputational benefits and legitimacy to firms (Daily & Schwenk, 1996) and can reduce uncertainty (Hillman et al., 2000).

Our reliance on agency- and resource dependence-related arguments corresponds with a recent stream of literature that emphasizes boards’ duties in protecting shareholders’ wealth as well as creating new wealth (Filatotchev, 2007; Zahra et al., 2009). On one hand, boards must minimize downside shareholder risk by monitoring managers, on the other hand, boards should also enable managerial entrepreneurship so that shareholders and other stakeholders benefit from the upside potential of firms (Filatotchev, 2007). This is consistent with Hillman and Dalziel’s (2003) notion of the two main functions of boards—monitoring and resource provision.

CSR can be defined as the integration of social and environmental concerns into firms’ operations and paying attention to stakeholders’ concerns (Carroll, 1979; Cheng et al., 2014; H. Wang et al., 2016). The most prominent stream in CSR research considers whether CSR adds financial value to the firm. This question can be considered settled for two reasons. First, the available meta-analyses all point to a (weak but) significant positive association between CSR and corporate financial performance (Endrikat et al., 2014; Orlitzky et al., 2003). Second, firms increasingly adopt CSR initiatives due to public awareness and pressure from various stakeholder groups (H. Wang et al., 2016; Ioannou & Serafeim, 2015). The recent United Nations Global Compact-Accenture (2019) CEO Survey shows that 94% of the more than 1,000 participating CEOs from around the world believe that CSR issues are important to the future success of their business. Because of the strategic importance of CSR and the fundamental role of boards in strategy development, boards are considered key players in firms’ CSR activities, being

# Endrikat et al.

directly or indirectly responsible for firms’ CSR strategy and performance and the consequences thereof (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017; Kassinis & Vafeas, 2002; Rao & Tilt, 2016).

Prior research has examined a variety of board characteristics. Of course, the constructs in any meta-analysis are restricted to the ones examined with some regularity in the prior literature, which is also the case with this study. Board size refers to the number of board members. Board independence refers to the number or proportion of outside directors (i.e., directors that are independent because they are not part of the management team) (Bergh et al., 2016). In line with Post and Byron (2015), we define female board representation as the number, proportion, or presence of women on boards of directors. CEO–chair duality refers to whether the same person jointly holds the titles of chief executive officer and chairperson of the board (Bergh et al., 2016). We define CSR committee as the existence of a board committee specifically responsible for CSR-related matters, and in practice, these committees may also be referred to as “sustainability,” “corporate ethics,” or “environmental” committees (Helfaya & Moussa, 2017).

# Board Size and CSR

Regarding the monitoring role of boards—the primary focus of agency theory arguments pertaining to boards of directors—it has been argued that larger boards are more actively involved in monitoring and evaluating activities and are less susceptible to managerial domination (Zahra & Pearce, 1989). According to RDT—highlighting the resource provision function of directors—firms should benefit from larger boards, because there are more directors, who can each provide access to resources, such as specialized knowledge and networks (Hillman et al., 2009; Pfeffer, 1972). In particular, the presence of more directors potentially provides more external links and knowledge to secure critical CSR resources, more CSR-related experience, knowledge, advice, and counsel (Dalton et al., 1999; de Villiers et al., 2011). Therefore, we state the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 1 (H1): Board size is positively related to CSR.

From an agency theory viewpoint, outside directors are better monitors of managers, as they are independent of the top management team and the firm (Dalton et al., 1998; J. L. Johnson et al., 1996). Because CSR goes hand in hand with a more long-term orientation of firms (Eccles et al., 2014) and as

# Business & Society 00(0)

CSR activities need some time to translate into firm value (Carroll & Shabana, 2010), outside directors may be more likely to foster CSR, because they tend to pursue longer time horizons and thus are more likely to see the long-term potential of investments in environmental and social projects (de Villiers et al., 2011; Post et al., 2011). Also from an RDT perspective, the number of independent directors should relate positively to CSR because they are more likely to have, and provide, access to alternative sources of CSR-related knowledge and networks, than directors who are associated with the firm. Therefore, our second hypothesis is:

# Hypothesis 2 (H2): Board independence is positively related to CSR.

# Female Board Representation and CSR

Research from multiple disciplines provides evidence that women differ from men with regard to morals and ethics (Borkowski & Ugras, 1998; Jaffee & Hyde, 2000), educational background and expertise (Hillman et al., 2002), and risk preferences (Croson & Gneezy, 2009). In general, women are deemed to be more concerned with social issues (Elm et al., 2001). Moreover, women have different ways of thinking, have superior communication skills, are less prone to suffer from overconfidence, and provide unique resource portfolios, including distinct risk-taking attitudes (Huang & Kisgen, 2013; Jeong & Harrison, 2017), which are likely to predispose them toward a positive attitude toward CSR. A recent meta-analysis—exclusively focusing on women on boards and CSR—found a positive relationship between female directors and CSR (Byron & Post, 2016). However, we deem it meaningful to reexamine this relationship for two reasons. First, we embed this relationship in our meta-analytic path model testing the mediating role of CSR committees. Second, we complement the findings of Byron and Post (2016) by investigating potential differences between the environmental and the social dimension of CSR in our moderator analyses. We state the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 3 (H3): Female board representation is positively related to CSR.

# CEO–Chair Duality and CSR

Above, we argued that board independence is likely to be positively related to CSR. One aspect that can undermine a board’s independence is the leadership structure of the board. A CEO that also serves as chair of the board

Endrikat et al. - 9

(i.e., CEO–chair duality) may not be trusted by shareholders to effectively monitor his or her own activities as CEO. CEO–chair duality also induces management entrenchment and thus decreases the monitoring effectiveness of the entire board (Finkelstein & Aveni, 1994). In essence, CEO–chair duality increases information asymmetry between the CEO and the board and strengthens managerial power in the boardroom, as a CEO–chair is able to monopolize board meetings and advance his or her own agenda to the detriment of the firm (de Villiers et al., 2011; Finkelstein & Aveni, 1994). In the context of CSR, this would imply that it is easier for short-term-oriented, profit-maximizing CEOs to advance their own agenda at the expense of long-term CSR-related investments if they are also chair of the board (de Villiers et al., 2011). In contrast, separate CEO and chair positions provide further checks and balances and may prevent that a CEO can divert board attention away from CSR activities that are likely to have longer payback periods (Galbreath, 2018a). We therefore propose the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 4 (H4): CEO–chair duality is negatively related to CSR.

# Mediating Role of the Presence of a CSR Committee

So far, we have followed the majority of the prior literature and provided arguments for direct relationships between CSR and each board characteristic. However, the relationships between board characteristics and CSR might be more complex than most of the existing research suggests. Some recent articles set out that previous models have been overly parsimonious in that they ignore the possibility of interweaving characteristics and overlook mediating factors that may link board characteristics and firm outcomes (Post & Byron, 2015; Post et al., 2015; Pye & Pettigrew, 2005). We build on this line of thought and examine a more advanced model. In particular, we argue that the presence of a CSR committee may partially mediate the relationships between the other board characteristics and CSR. Thus, board size, board independence, female representation on boards, and CEO–chair duality may not only have direct effects on CSR but also indirect effects translated into CSR via the presence of a CSR committee.

Specific committees as subgroups of the board have long been neglected by empirical research, but have recently attracted growing attention (S. G. Johnson et al., 2013; Kolev et al., 2019; Neville et al., 2019). These committees, with narrowly defined objectives, such as audit or compensation committees, are deemed to be of significant importance, as many of the critical processes and decisions of boards with regard to a firm’s policy and strategy,

# Business & Society

may derive from them (Dalton et al., 1998; Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017). Board committees serve a management support function as they enable directors to cope with the limited time that they have available and to deal with the complexity of information (Lorsch & MacIver, 1989). Moreover, equipped with specialized responsibilities and authorities, board committees also serve a monitoring function (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017; Harrison, 1987).

While firms began to adopt committees focusing on social and environmental issues during the 1970s (Harrison, 1987), recent studies document an increasing number of firms establishing CSR committees (Institute of Business Ethics, 2016; Spitzeck, 2009). The typical activities carried out by CSR committees comprise the creation, implementation, and updating of environmental and social policies, the assessment of a firm’s resource allocation decisions, and the coordination and monitoring of CSR-related issues (Gennari & Salvioni, 2019). That is, CSR committees oversee a firm’s impact on different stakeholders, such as communities, the environment, or employees, but also the specific interests of these groups, and thus can develop opportunities that may generate and protect shareholder value and also serve as a high-level control mechanism preventing downside risk from irresponsible firm behavior (Burke et al., 2019). Paine (2014) illustrates how Nike benefited from its CSR committee, and was transformed from being attacked by labor activists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to pioneering responsibility toward social and environmental issues. In addition, the presence of a CSR committee is a signal of a firm’s commitment and orientation toward CSR for both external stakeholders and organizational members (Mallin & Michelon, 2011; Walls et al., 2012).

We argue that the presence of a CSR committee is likely to mediate the relationships between the other board characteristics and CSR. Thus, board size, board independence, female representation on boards, and CEO–chair duality may have not only direct effects on CSR but also indirect effects translated into CSR via the presence of a CSR committee. The establishment of a CSR committee is a voluntary and deliberate decision. Unlike compensation and audit committees, which are often mandated (e.g., in the United States), CSR committees are purely voluntary (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017). Thus, the establishment of a CSR committee can be seen as a conscious strategic decision to actively foster social and environmental responsibility and to explicitly take responsibility for nonshareholding stakeholders’ interests (Eccles et al., 2014). Or in other words, the formation of a CSR committee is a way to institutionalize CSR in a firm (Gennari & Salvioni, 2019). Moreover, several researchers suggest that board committees influence firm outcomes in a more meaningful way than the board as a whole (Daily & Schwenk, 1996; Dalton et al., 1998; Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017). That is because the most

Endrikat et al. - 11

important board decisions are taken in a specialized committee rather than at the more general board level (Kesner, 1988). Moreover, by means of a CSR committee, firms explicitly assign responsibility to specific individuals and hold them accountable, also to specific stakeholder groups (Burke et al., 2019). For example, while a higher proportion of females on the board may generally provide the impetus for a proactive CSR strategy, a CSR committee that coordinates and reviews CSR-related activities and proposed investments are more likely to effectively translate general intentions into CSR outcomes. A CSR committee can also serve as a buffer, mitigating potential negative effects of CEO–chair duality on CSR activities. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:

# Hypothesis 5 (H5):

The presence of a CSR committee (partially) mediates the relationships between CSR and board characteristics, such as board size, board independence, female representation on boards, and CEO–chair duality.

# Moderators of Board Characteristics–CSR Relationships

Meta-analysis not only determines the overall strength and direction of a relationship but also allows for an examination of potential moderating effects. In this sense, meta-analysis allows the identification of boundary conditions that cannot be explored by primary studies that rely on data within these boundaries. We next hypothesize possible moderators of the focal board characteristics–CSR relationships.

An emerging stream of literature highlights the importance of country-level institutional factors in determining firm strategies and practices (Carney et al., 2011; Heugens et al., 2009). CSR practices and activities have also been shown to be contingent upon institutional settings, such as the legal and political systems, regulatory stringency, and culture (Jain & Jamali, 2016). CSR activities usually affect firm outcomes indirectly via stakeholders’ reactions (H. Wang et al., 2016). Given that stakeholder attitudes vary across countries (Matten & Moon, 2008), it is not surprising that CSR-related relationships vary by country (Ioannou & Serafeim, 2012).

Moreover, previous research has shown that both formal and informal institutional mechanisms significantly determine corporate governance practices and characteristics of the boards of directors (Aguilera & Jackson, 2010; Grosvold, 2011; J. Li & Harrison, 2008). In fact, scholars argue that the mixed empirical findings in corporate governance studies may be due to the neglect of contextual issues (Aguilera et al., 2012; Filatotchev, 2008). In particular, it is argued that certain country-level governance systems, such as

corporate ownership structures, the legal system, and corporate law, significantly determine the effectiveness of corporate governance. This implies that these country-level factors could substitute or complement corporate governance aspects. Mechanisms are substitutes when an increase in one mechanism directly replaces a portion of the other (i.e., functional replacement); in contrast, two mechanisms are complements when an increase in one leads to an increasing effect of the other mechanism (i.e., synergistic effect) (Aguilera et al., 2012). For example, long-term bank-firm relationships, which are typical for Germany and Japan, may effectively substitute for an active market of control (Filatotchev, 2007). Or high levels of blockholder ownership may partially substitute for board independence (Aguilera et al., 2012; Oh et al. (2018)).

One of the key institutional factors affecting corporate governance choices is shareholder protection (La Porta et al., 2000; Leuz et al., 2003). Strong and well enforced legal protection of shareholder rights limits expropriation risks and may decrease the need for boards of directors to monitor and avoids managerial discretion (Villaron-Peramato et al., 2018). Thus, strong shareholder protection might effectively substitute for the monitoring role of corporate boards implying weaker effects of board characteristics on CSR.

However, an alternative argument has been brought forward by Post and Byron (2015). They propose that stronger shareholder protection may provide increased motivation to corporate boards to strive for and take into account the multiple perspectives of board members and to integrate the divergent expertise and values held by different board members (Byron & Post, 2016; Post and Byron, 2015). Hence, shareholder protection is likely to motivate boards to more effectively capitalize on their CSR resources, suggesting that shareholder protection could complement—instead of substitute for—boards characteristics’ impact on CSR. Given the two competing perspectives, we offer a nondirectional hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 6 (H6): A country’s shareholder protection level moderates the relationships between CSR and board characteristics, such as board size, board independence, female representation on boards, CEO–chair duality, and the presence of a CSR committee.

Post and Byron’s (2015) meta-analysis on the relationship between female board representation and firm financial performance finds that a country’s level of gender parity significantly moderates the relationship. Byron and Post (2016) show that this country-level factor also moderates the relationship between female board representation and CSR. In contexts with greater gender parity (i.e., contexts in which men and women are more similar in terms of

# Endrikat et al.

# 13

education, economic participation, health, and political empowerment, the distribution of power between male and female board members will be more balanced and thus women will be more likely to be heard and considered in decision-making processes (Byron and Post, 2016). In other words, a country’s level of gender parity may complement the positive effect of female board representation on CSR. Because our sample of studies differs from those of Byron and Post (2016) in that we include more recent studies—in particular, studies published after the year 2015, which is the last year covered by Byron and Post (2016)—we deem it necessary to revisit these relationships. We hypothesize the following:

# Hypothesis 7 (H7):

Countries’ gender parity positively moderates the relationship between CSR and female representation on boards.

CSR is a multidimensional construct (Rowley & Berman, 2000; H. Wang et al., 2016). Different studies use different measures of overall CSR performance and/or different measures of specific dimensions of CSR. Aggregate measures of CSR subsume dimensions that are not necessarily related to each other, such as environmental performance and social performance (H. Wang et al., 2016). The environmental and social aspects of CSR differ substantially, because environmental issues tend to be more systemic, affect multiple organizational and operational functions, and involve factors that are internally focused (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017; Russo & Fouts, 1997). Therefore, it is likely that the relationships between board characteristics and CSR systematically differ depending on whether an aggregate measure of CSR is used or whether a measure explicitly focusing on the environmental or the social dimension of CSR is applied in primary studies. Hence, acknowledging the importance of unpacking the dimensions of CSR and to provide a more fine-grained analysis, our final hypothesis is:

# Hypothesis 8 (H8):

The dimension of CSR (aggregate, social, or environmental) moderates the relationships between CSR and the board characteristics, such as board size, board independence, female representation on boards, CEO–chair duality, and the presence of a CSR committee.

# Method

# Identification of Studies

We employed three complementary procedures to identify prior empirical studies. First, we conducted a keyword search in the following databases:

# Business & Society 00(0)

Business Source Complete, Science Direct, JSTOR, and Wiley Online Library, using the following search string: (“board” OR “CEO” OR “corporate governance”) AND (“CSR” OR “corporate social” OR “environmental performance” OR “environmental responsibility” OR “sustainability”).

Second, we searched for unpublished manuscripts in the Social Science Research Network database. Third, we employed an ancestry approach (Aguinis et al., 2011) and searched through the reference lists of the studies identified in the preceding steps and in the narrative review of Jain and Jamali (2016) and the meta-analysis of Byron and Post (2016).

To be included in our analysis, studies needed to report a bivariate correlation between our focal board characteristic constructs and a measure of CSR (i.e., a measure of aggregate CSR or the environmental or the social dimension of CSR). The constructs from which correlations are reported did not have to be the main focus of the study (Dalton & Dalton, 2005). This procedure is in line with general meta-analytic practice (Geyskens et al., 2009) and potentially decreases the risk of biased meta-analytic results due to publication bias—the fact that statistically significant results are more likely to have been published (Post & Byron, 2015).

The final set of studies included in our analyses consists of 82 primary studies representing a total of 167,713 observations. These studies were published between the years 1991 and 2019 with a clear trend toward more studies being published in more recent years. The references of the studies used for the meta-analytic calculations are included in the supplemental file available online.

# Coding of Studies

We coded the effect sizes of the focal relationships (i.e., the relationships between board characteristics and CSR), the effect sizes of the relationships between the board characteristics, because we need them for our meta-analytic path models, as well as information needed for our analyses of potential moderating effects. We initially coded a set of studies to establish and validate the coding rules, resolving ambiguous cases and differences in coding through discussion, before reaching consensus (Sleesman et al., 2012). Next, the first author of this study completed the rest of the coding. Finally, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the coding, we had an independent rater (postgraduate in management) that coded approximately one quarter (k = 20) of the studies (Carpenter & Berry, 2017). Apart from some minor discrepancies that were resolved through communicative validation (Kvale, 1995), the overall agreement was high and the calculated Cohen’s Kappa (.92) suggests almost perfect reliability (Landis & Koch, 1977).

# Endrikat et al.

Studies in our sample measured board size as the number of board members. In one study (Bai, 2013), the number of directors was scaled by the size of the organizations. Board independence was measured by means of the number or proportion of outside directors. In cases where studies measured the number, proportion, or ratio of inside directors, we converted the sign of the correlation. The primary studies measured female board representation in different ways. In the majority of studies, the number or proportion of women on boards was used as a measure. Two studies (Jia & Zhang, 2012; Post et al., 2011) used a critical mass measure, which equals 1 if the board consists at least of three women. CEO–chair duality was either measured as binary variable equaling 1 if the CEO also serves as chairperson of the board or in a reverse manner (i.e., a variable that equals 1 if the CEO is not the chairman) (Surroca & Tribo, 2009). In the latter case we converted the sign of the correlation. With regard to the presence of a CSR committee, we conformed to the existing literature (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017; Mallin & Michelon, 2011) and regarded “environmental committees,” “sustainability committees,” or “corporate ethics committees” as CSR committees. Our focal dependent construct, CSR, was measured in a variety of ways, reflecting its multidimensional nature. Most of the studies in our sample use aggregate measures of CSR combining different environmental and social aspects (e.g., aggregate indices based on the items of the Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini [KLD] database). For our moderator analysis, we were primarily interested in potential differences between the environmental and social dimensions of CSR (Bansal et al., 2014). Therefore, we sought to keep these dimensions apart whenever it was possible. In particular, we built composites in the case of studies using different subdimensions of the social dimension of CSR (e.g., community-related CSR measures and employee-related CSR measures) as well as in the case of studies using multiple subdimensions of the environmental dimension of CSR (e.g., measures of waste and measures of toxic waste). Apart from the moderator analysis pertaining to the specific dimension of CSR, we included both effect sizes in our analyses when a study reported correlations for both the environmental and the social dimension. This procedure is in line with other recent meta-analyses (Lander & Heugens, 2017; Mutlu et al., 2018) and is deemed to outperform procedures using only a single effect size according to Bijmolt and Pieters (2001). In cases where studies measured corporate social irresponsibility, such as environmental lawsuits (Kassinis & Vafeas, 2002) or the amount of carbon emissions (Haque, 2017), we converted the sign of the correlation.

Apart from the distinction between the environmental and the social dimension of CSR, we examine two country-level institutional factors as potential moderators. First, with regard to all relationships between board

# Business & Society 00(0)

characteristics and CSR, we explore the influence of shareholder protection strength. Therefore, we coded each study using the value of the investor protection index provided by the World Economic Forum (Schwab, 2018). The index ranges from 0 to 10, with higher index values indicating better shareholder protection, and comprises of three dimensions: (a) the extent to which there is transparency of related-party transactions, (b) the extent to which directors are held liable for self-dealing, and (c) the ease with which shareholders can sue for director misconduct. For single-country studies, we coded the index associated with that country. For studies covering multiple countries (i.e., six or fewer countries), we calculated the average index for those countries. Studies using large multicountry samples were excluded from this moderation analysis. This procedure follows Post and Byron (2015). With regard to the relationship between female representation on boards and CSR, we explore the potential moderating effect of a country-level measure of gender parity. We coded each study using the World Economic Forum’s (2018) gender gap index. This index ranges from 0 to 1 with higher index values indicating greater gender equality in terms of economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment. In cases of multicountry samples, we follow the same procedure as we did for the shareholder protection index.

# Meta-Analytic Procedures

We used the software Meta-essentials (Suurmond et al., 2017) and calculated random-effects models assuming the variability between effect sizes is due to sampling error in addition to the variability in the population (Lee et al., 2017; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). In line with prior meta-analyses (Jeong & Harrison, 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Lee & Madhavan, 2010) and following Hedges and Vevea (1998), correlations were first transformed using Fisher’s z transformation, because the sample correlation r is not an unbiased estimator of the population r (Dalton & Dalton, 2005; Hunter & Schmidt, 2004). Z-transformed correlations have statistical properties of being approximately normally distributed. Furthermore, according to Geyskens and colleagues (2009), this procedure ensures an optimal weighting of effect sizes as the sample variance depends only on sample size and not on the population itself. We computed 95% confidence intervals to assess the significance of the mean effect sizes. A confidence interval that does not include zero indicates that the mean effect size is statistically significant (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). To test the homogeneity of the effect size distributions, we used Q statistics and I2 statistics. The Q statistic represents total dispersion in effect sizes and reflects the need to test moderators when it is significant (Allan et al., 2018; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). The I2 statistic refers to the amount of observed variance.

# Endrikat et al.

that is due to true differences among the studies, rather than error (Allan et al., 2018). Significant heterogeneity suggesting the presence of moderating effects is indicated when the Q statistic is significant and the I2 statistic suggests that there is a significant amount of variance attributed to true differences (i.e., I greater than 75%) (Allan et al., 2018)2.

One potential problem of meta-analysis is the file drawer problem, also called publication bias, which refers to circumstances in which “the research that appears in the published literature is systematically unrepresentative of the population of completed studies” (Rothstein et al., 2005, p. 1). This might occur when the decision to submit or publish studies is influenced by the magnitude, direction, or significance of the study’s findings in such a way that findings that, for instance, are not statistically significant are less likely to be published (Geyskens et al., 2009). We addressed this issue by calculating the fail-safe N that provides an estimate of the number of null-effect studies that would be needed to render the mean effect insignificant (Rosenthal, 1979).

We used the meta-analytically derived mean correlations between board characteristics and CSR, as well as the intercorrelations among the board characteristics, to conduct meta-analytic path analysis (Bergh et al., 2016; Viswesvaran & Ones, 1995). For this purpose, we used the meta-analytic correlation matrix as input for MPlus 8.2. Consistent with prior studies, we used the harmonic mean sample size from the correlation matrix as the sample size for our analysis (Allan et al., 2018; Jeong & Harrison, 2017). Meta-analytic path modeling allows us to examine simultaneously the relationships among the board characteristics and with CSR. Moreover, it enables us to test H6 about the (partial) mediation of the presence of a CSR committee.

For examining our hypotheses regarding potential moderating effects, we used random-effects meta-regression analyses (Jeong & Harrison, 2017; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001), in which the dependent variable is the meta-analytically derived mean correlation for a certain relationship and the independent variables are the suggested moderators. A significant beta coefficient suggests that the examined factor moderates the focal relationship.

support for H1. In H2, we predicted a positive relationship between board independence and CSR. The meta-analytic effect size is positive and statistically significant (r = .108; 95% CI = [.062, .153]), thus supporting H2. Also H3, predicting a positive relationship between female board representation and CSR, receives empirical support (r = .203; 95% CI = [.159, .247]). Regarding the relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR (H4), we suggested a negative relationship. The small and non-significant mean correlation (r = .020; 95% CI = [−.020, .060]) does not support this hypothesis.

For all significant relationships, the calculated fail-safe N suggests robustness of our findings in terms of a bias against the publication of null findings. The number of null-effect findings that would be needed to overturn the relationships are all above the tolerance level suggested by Rosenthal (1979).

The Q statistics and the I2 statistics reject the assumption of homogeneity for hypotheses H1 to H4. Thus, moderator analyses are warranted for all of these board characteristics–CSR relationships.

# Meta-Analytic Path Model Results

Table 2 shows the meta-analytic correlation matrix used as input to test our meta-analytic path model. We test a model (displayed in Figure 1) in which the presence of a CSR committee partially mediates the relationships between CSR and the other board characteristics: board size, board independence, female representation on boards, and CEO–chair duality. We allow those board characteristics, which displayed significant mean correlations in the meta-analytic correlation matrix (Table 2), to covary with each other. As reported in Table 3, the model fits the data in an acceptable manner (comparative fit index [CFI] = .958, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .056, standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = .022) and all paths are significant, except the path linking CEO–chair duality to CSR directly and the path linking CEO–chair duality to the presence of a CSR committee.

The indirect effects on CSR that are channeled through the presence of a CSR committee are significant for board size (β = .023; p < .001), board independence (β = .014; p < .001), and female board representation (β = .030; p < .001). Thus, H5 is supported suggesting a partial mediation of the presence of a CSR committee, except for CEO–chair duality, which is neither directly (β = .002; p = .708) nor indirectly related to CSR (β = .001; p = .242) and is also not significantly related to the presence of a CSR committee (β = .007; p = .241).

# Meta-Regression Results

To test our hypotheses concerning potentially moderating effects, we estimated random-effects meta-regression models. Table 4 reports the results. Regarding H6, concerning the influence of countries’ shareholder protection strength, we find significantly negative effects regarding the relationships between board size (β = −.489; p < .001) and CSR and board independence and CSR (β = −.466; p < .001) (i.e., the positive relationships are significantly weaker in countries with stronger levels of shareholder protection).

In H7, we hypothesized that countries’ level of gender parity moderates the relationship between female board representation and CSR. Our results...

show a significantly positive effect (β = .542; p < .001), providing evidence that the relationship between female board representation and CSR is more positive for firms in countries with greater gender parity. This result is in line with the finding of Byron and Post (2016).

Our hypothesis H8 was about possible differences in the relationships depending on whether the environmental or the social dimension of CSR is examined. To test this hypothesis, we included dummy variables in the regression models taking the value of 1 when the measurement of CSR in the study focused on the environmental dimension of CSR (or social dimension respectively) and 0 in the case of aggregate CSR measures. We find that an exclusive focus on the environmental dimension significantly weakens the relationship between board size and CSR (β = −.359; p = .002) and the relationship between female board representation and CSR (β = −.301; p = .054). We also find that an exclusive focus on the social dimension significantly strengthens the relationship between board independence and CSR (β = .208; p = .073), and the relationship between female board representation and CSR (β = .347; p = .013), but weakens the relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR (β = −.253; p = .051). However, given that we found that the CEO–chair duality—CSR relationship is not significant, this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Questions. In addition, prior research typically relied on simple models that fail to account for possible interrelationships between different board characteristics and ignore mediating mechanisms that might be at play. Finally, very little attention has as yet been paid to potential boundary conditions of the relationships. Our meta-analytic study clarifies several of those issues.

# Joint Effects of Board Characteristics on CSR and Mediating Role of the Presence of a CSR Committee

Our results show that board size, board independence, female board representation, and the presence of a CSR committee are positively related to CSR. Thus, we find empirical support for our arguments based on a combination of agency theory and resource dependence theory, suggesting that boards influence CSR by way of their monitoring function and their resource provision function (Hillman & Dalziel, 2003). Furthermore, our meta-analytic path model suggests that board size, board independence, female board representation, and the presence of a CSR committee are positively related to CSR.

# Business & Society 00(0)

Representation, and the presence of a CSR committee are partially interrelated with each other (i.e., board size with female board representation and board independence with female board representation) and jointly influence CSR (i.e., operate in conjunction, Jain & Jamali, 2016). Hence, our results contribute to the literature by suggesting the need for future studies to use more complex models that acknowledge these joint effects. Studies that fail to account for the interrelatedness of board characteristics risk to provide inaccurate estimates and erroneous inferences about the relationships under study. Therefore, we strongly encourage research to take a more holistic approach and to examine how board characteristics operate as a complex nexus or a bundle of complements and substitutes. Although this “bundle of governance mechanisms” perspective harks back to Rediker and Seth (1995), to our best knowledge, only Oh and colleagues (2018) have applied this insight in a CSR context. In terms of methodology, qualitative comparative analysis can be a meaningful approach, which has recently been applied by Misangyi and Acharya (2014). This approach would allow disentangling possible manifestations of board characteristics that combine effectively with each other (Misangyi and Acharya, 2014).

Furthermore, our research adds to the literature that suggests that board committees may be more meaningful predictors of firm outcomes than the board characteristics themselves (Daily, 1994; Dalton et al., 1998; Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017). Our evidence that the presence of a CSR committee channels the impacts of board size, board independence, and female board representation on CSR shows the importance of board committees in general and CSR committees in particular. Many critical board processes and decisions take place in committees (Dalton et al., 1998; Kesner, 1988). Especially where specialized knowledge and complex decisions are involved, such as CSR, dedicated committees enable boards to function more effectively (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2017). Therefore, in line with Neville and colleagues (2019) for instance, we contend that a more explicit focus on characteristics at the committee-level, instead of the board-level, may provide a more nuanced understanding. In sum, future research should further disentangle the interplay between board characteristics, board committees, and CSR.

# Insignificant Relationship of CEO–Chair Duality

Our finding of an insignificant relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR suggests that CEO–chair duality per se neither fosters nor undermines CSR. Thus, while CEO–chair duality is among the most widely examined aspects in corporate governance research and is of continuing interest to shareholder activists and institutional investors (Dalton & Dalton, 2011; Dalton

# Endrikat et al.

et al., 1998), we find no generalizable evidence for an effect on CSR. CEO–chairs with positive attitudes toward social and environmental issues may use their power to promote CSR, while CEOs who do not regard CSR as important or who lack CSR expertise may undermine CSR. Thus, our study may encourage future research to go beyond the coarse-grained duality construct and examine more specific CEO attributes, such as education, experience, or values and beliefs, and whether the CEO–chairs are founders, heirs, or professional managers (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Siegel, 2014; Tang et al., 2015, 2018).

# Moderating Effects in the Relationships Between Board Characteristics and CSR

Our study also sheds light on potential boundary conditions that may alter the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. First, we show that a country’s shareholder protection strength weakens the positive effects of board size and board independence on CSR (i.e., in contexts associated with higher levels of accountability and liability of the board), CSR is well managed by most companies, and therefore, board characteristics do not have a major impact. These findings suggest that high levels of legal and regulatory shareholder protection can substitute for positive board-level impacts on CSR, which is in line with the literature that emphasizes the need to consider the role of the institutional context in corporate governance research (Aguilera et al., 2012; Yoshikawa et al., 2014). Future research that examines this substitution hypothesis more comprehensively would be a worthy pursuit.

We also investigated gender parity as a country-level moderator and our finding confirms previous meta-analytic evidence (Byron & Post, 2016; Post & Byron, 2015). Our findings show that a country’s level of gender parity reinforces or complements the positive effect that women on boards have on CSR (i.e., women on boards can best accomplish higher levels of CSR in countries where they enjoy greater equality in terms of economic participation, educational attainment, or political empowerment). Future research may seek to explore how much of the positive effect of female board representation is due to the superior resources (i.e., knowledge and experience) that women may bring in countries with greater gender equality, compared with other contexts; how much is due to their different values and beliefs; and how much is due to the fact that women, even those on boards, may be less powerful in countries with greater inequality.

Finally, our moderator analysis reveals that the board characteristic relationships are stronger for the social dimension of CSR and weaker for the environmental dimension. Environmental issues are often more technical.

# Business & Society 00(0)

than social matters and thus require firms to focus on science and to implement technological solutions to production processes (Bansal et al., 2014). These technical solutions to environmental concerns often rely on internal processes, whereas approaches regarding social concerns tend to be more dependent on the actions of external stakeholders (Bansal et al., 2014). Thus, the CSR-related resource provision role of directors via larger boards and specific committees may be more conducive to the social dimension of CSR than the environmental dimension. The stronger relationship between female directors and the social dimension compared with the environmental dimension might be explained by a generally stronger propensity of women to focus on social issues that can be seen as “soft issues” in contrast to environmental issues that tend to be more technical in nature (Rao & Tilt, 2016). Acknowledging that both broad and specific theories and insights are desirable (Edwards, 2001; Weick, 1979), we encourage researchers to use both aggregated and disaggregated measures to provide further insights.

# Limitations and Additional Future Research Directions

In common with all studies, there are several limitations that should be noted and which potentially indicate future research opportunities. First, our reliance on meta-analytic path modeling does not allow us to explore the interrelatedness of board characteristics by introducing interaction terms or using conditional correlation approaches. We encourage primary studies to explore these interactions.

Second, different studies use different measures for CSR. The environmental dimension is sometimes measured at a very specific operational level (e.g., by means of data from the Toxic Release Inventory of the Environmental Protection Agency, or by water productivity measures), and at other times in generic terms based on ratings, such as the MSCI KLD database. Similarly, the social dimension is measured in diverse ways, sometimes using MSCI KLD data, or at other times philanthropic activities outside the firm, such as charitable contributions. We were unable to analyze the effects of different measures in detail, which might be a fruitful avenue for further research.

Finally, meta-analyses are inherently limited in testing causality (Jeong & Harrison, 2017). Should primary studies employ time lags between the dependent and independent variables, a meta-analysis could—to some extent—infer causality (Endrikat et al., 2014). However, this is not the case for our sample of primary studies. As it is likely that certain board characteristics manifest their effects on CSR only after a certain period of time, addressing temporal effects could be a fruitful avenue for future research.

# Conclusion

This meta-analysis addresses the current state of research concerning the relationships between board characteristics and CSR. We show that board size, board independence, female board representation, and the presence of a CSR committee positively relate to CSR. As regards the relationship between CEO–chair duality and CSR, we do not find a significant effect. Thus, our study helps to reconcile mixed evidence provided by primary studies. Moreover, we provide evidence consistent with the views that (a) board size, board independence, and female board representation jointly determine CSR and (b) the presence of a CSR committee mediates these relationships. In this regard, our study adds to the recent literature promoting more holistic approaches in studying board characteristics. Finally, we highlight important boundary conditions that alter the focal relationships. Our results suggest that macro-contextual factors such as countries’ investor protection strength and gender parity act as moderators. In particular, we find that stronger shareholder protection in a country weakens the positive effects of board size and board independence on CSR—consistent with the view that countries’ investor protection mechanisms substitute for these board characteristics—and that greater gender parity at the country level strengthens the positive relationship between female board representation and CSR—consistent with the view that countries’ gender parity complement females on boards’ positive impact on CSR. Moreover, our findings show that the relationships depend upon the specific CSR dimension examined (i.e., social vs. environmental dimension). Specifically, the relationships are more positive with regard to the social dimension of CSR (i.e., for board independence and for female board representation) and weaker for the environmental dimension (i.e., for board size, for female board representation, and for the presence of a CSR committee). By providing evidence on these boundary conditions, our study also contributes to theory development.

# Notes

1. Two meta-analyses integrated the empirical body of knowledge in this regard. Dalton and colleagues (1998) examined the relationship between board composition aspects (i.e., inside/outside director proportions and affiliated/independent director proportions) and financial performance as well as the relationship between board leadership structure (i.e., duality of CEO/chairperson roles) and financial performance. For each case, they found no evidence of a substantial relationship. Dalton and colleagues (1999) meta-analytically examined the relationship between board size and financial performance and found a significant positive relationship.
2. The studies included in our analyses operationalize corporate social responsibility (CSR) mostly by means of CSR ratings such as the Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini (KLD) rating. Thus, the measures provide a mix of outcome- and process-based CSR.
3. Our general reasoning for distinguishing between the environmental and the social dimension of CSR in our moderator analysis is provided later on in the article. In short, environmental issues are more technical in nature, while social issues to a greater degree involve moral and ethical reasoning aspects. Therefore, the effect of female board representation might differ with regard to the specific dimensions of CSR.
4. Both perspectives—the substitution perspective and the complementarity perspective—are represented in recent corporate governance research and the empirical evidence is ambiguous (Misangyi & Acharya, 2014; Oh et al., 2018; Rediker & Seth, 1995; Ward et al., 2009).
5. Gender parity as a potential moderator makes only sense for the relationship between female board representation and CSR, but not for the other focal relationships. Therefore, H7 exclusively pertains to female board representation.
6. The creation of a composite correlation results in a more construct valid measure of the construct of interest (Higgins et al., 2003; Ones & Viswesvaran, 1996).
7. According to Rosenthal (1979), the file drawer tolerance is set at 5X + 10, where X is the number of available effect sizes.
8. We also compared our results with a baseline model, in which all of the board characteristics—also the presence of a CSR committee—are directly related to CSR (i.e., a one-to-one direct model). This model showed a slightly inferior fit to the data as indicated by the fit indices and the chi-square difference test was non-significant.
9. As robustness tests, we also estimate meta-regressions without the effect sizes for which we had to calculate the average due to multiple countries in the primary study sample. In all cases the results remained qualitatively similar.
10. With regard to the relationship between the presence of a CSR committee and CSR, only one study was available exclusively focusing on the social dimension, thus not allowing a meaningful analysis.

# Abstract

Research on the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and financial performance (CFP) continuously receives high attention in both general media and academic publications. One central issue concerns the causal effects between the two constructs. Because existing primary literature is characterized by its heterogeneous study designs and mixed empirical evidence, the aim of this paper is to explicitly shed light on the causality effects between CEP and CFP by means of a meta‐analysis of 893 empirical estimates from 142 CEP–CFP studies. Our findings suggest that in the short run (1 year), financial resources can increase a firm's environmental performance as proposed by the slack resources hypothesis; however, the effects disappear in the long run (after more than 1 year). Conversely, increasing environmental performance has no short‐term effect on a corporate financial performance, whereas a firm significantly benefits in the long term, which is in accordance with the Porter hypothesis. Overall, our results show that the causality between environmental performance and financial performance depends on the time horizon.

# 1 | INTRODUCTION

Over the past decades, empirical literature studying the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and financial performance (CFP) has grown rapidly. As a consequence, controversies arose concerning the sign of the relation, moderating and mediating factors, and the causality of the effect (Feng et al., 2018; Hartmann & Vachon, 2018). Due to these aspects, academics often refer to this bivariate relation as an overall heterogeneous and complex interaction (Endrikat, Guenther, & Hoppe, 2014; Guenther & Hoppe, 2014). Although literature provides a vast number of comprehensive and meaningful primary studies (among others, Hart & Ahuja, 1996; King & Lenox, 2002; Konar & Cohen, 2001; Russo & Fouts, 1997; Tang, Walsh, Lerner, Fitza, & Li, 2018) and meta‐analyses (among others, Albertini, 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014; Guenther, Hoppe, & Endrikat, 2012; Hang, Geyer‐Klingeberg, Rathgeber, & Stöckl, 2018), the discussion of the causality is largely fragmented. Besides the prevalent mixed empirical evidence, existing primary studies are strongly characterized by their heterogeneous study designs, which hampers comparison. Overall, the questions whether CEP affects CFP, CFP affects CEP, or if there even exists a bidirectional relation are still unresolved, also the signs of the respective effects are ambiguous.

The most common approach of addressing this issue in a primary study is the application of the Granger causality specification (Angrist & Pischke, 2009). Therein, CEP and CFP are analyzed in a regression framework, whereas the two constructs of interest are measured at different time lags. The results for the causal effects are then revealed by exchanging the dependent and independent variable or varying the time lag between them. Although delayed effects are not identical to causality, they are at least accepted as a strong indicator (e.g., Bono & McNamara, 2011; Mitchell & James, 2001; Wagner & Blom, 2011).

Most of the existing studies focus on a single causality between CEP and CFP. The majority of articles analyzes the causality from CEP to CFP, as for example, the studies by Hart and Ahuja (1996), Hillman and Keim (2001), King and Lenox (2002), Konar and Cohen (2001), and Russo and Fouts (1997). In contrast, a smaller part of the literature investigates the causality from CFP to CEP. This includes, for example, the studies from Arora and Cason (1995), Berrone and Gomez‐Mejia (2009), Cohen, Fenn, and Naimon (1995), Levy (1995), and Makni, Francoeur, and Bellavance (2009). As the concentration on a single direction of causality does not allow general conclusions, several primary studies contrast the two causal directions. Ameer and Othman (2012) and Makni et al. (2009) confirm a negative influence of CEP on CFP after 1 year. Horváthová (2012) extends this result by finding that CEP leads to a CFP decrease after 1 year, but firms profit from CEP after 2 years. Hart and Ahuja (1996) suggest that CEP has a positive effect after 1 year for accounting‐based CFP measures and after 2 years for market‐based CFP measures, because it takes some time until the market recognizes a firm's environmental performance. Using a 1‐year lag, Nakao, Amano, Matsumura, Genba, and Nakano (2007) even find significant effects for both causal directions. However, they add that CEP increases CFP only recently, but the positive effect from CFP to CEP exists longer. In contrast, CEP does not affect future CFP according to Alvarez (2012). Heras‐Saizarbitoria, Molina‐Azorín, and Dick (2011) find in a longitudinal study that CEP does at least conditionally increase CFP. Their results imply that firms that are more profitable prefer investing in CEP, although there are also weak anticipation effects of investors. However, they state that firms do not profit from enhanced CEP in the future. In this context, Kim and Statman (2012) propose that the positive relation between CFP and CEP is greater in times of CFP increases in contrast to periods of CFP decreases. In contrast, Levy (1995) reveals that the effect is insignificant for both causal directions using a 1‐year lag. Overall, primary studies show inconclusive results for the general question of the causality between CEP and CFP, which might especially stem from different variable measures, sample compositions, and estimation methods (Guenther et al., 2012; Guenther & Hoppe, 2014). Overall, empirical evidence from primary studies is fragmented and inconsistent.

Considering these circumstances, several meta‐analyses review the cumulative results of the literature by quantitatively aggregating existing primary studies. Dixon‐Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand, and Romi (2013) examine the causality by comparing the reported results in the form of 202 Pearson correlation coefficients from 39 studies measuring CEP and CFP concurrently with measuring CFP 1 or more years ahead. However, they find no significant difference between the two groups. The causality from CFP to CEP is not analyzed due to a lack of data. Dixon‐Fowler et al. (2013) encourage to also “examine this important relationship.” Furthermore, Endrikat et al. (2014) analyze the causality between CEP and CFP based on 245 Pearson correlation coefficients from 149 primary studies and additionally take the reverse causality into account. Because they use multidimensional subgroups by splitting the sample according to the analyzed causality and the variable measurement, a general understanding of the causality is still not possible. Their results reveal statistically and economically significant effects from CEP to CFP for process‐based CEP and subsequent accounting‐based CFP as well as for outcome‐based CEP and subsequent market‐based CFP. Moreover, they find statistically and economically significant effects for all specifications measuring CEP and CFP concurrently. In contrast, they find no evidence for CFP affecting CEP. The meta‐analyses by Albertini (2013), Guenther et al. (2012), and Horváthová (2010) do not analyze the causality issue at all. This summary demonstrates that meta‐analytical literature addressing this question is also characterized by mixed results and various study designs providing only insufficient answers to the question of causality.

This study aims to provide the first complete analysis of the CEP–CFP causality by means of meta‐analysis using a sample of 893 existing results drawn from 142 empirical primary studies and contributes to prior primary studies as well as meta‐analyses in the following ways. We thoroughly analyze the following three relations: CEP affecting CFP, CFP affecting CEP, and the bidirectional impact. Furthermore, we investigate the temporal development of the effects by including yearly lagged effects up to 5 years, which has yet not been done in previous literature. This approach allows more general and fine‐grained conclusions regarding CEP–CFP causality. In contrast to prior reviews, we use the partial correlation coefficient derived from regression coefficients to measure the bivariate relationship. As advantages over traditional Pearson correlation coefficients as used in the majority of previous literature, disruptive effects are filtered out in order to isolate the effect of interest. Moreover, primary studies mostly report multiple results in their regression analysis (for different time periods, model specifications, and other subgroups) but only few studies report Pearson correlations. Accordingly, the use to partial correlations computed from regression results maximize the sample of primary studies and effect sizes to be included in the meta‐analysis. Moreover, we also test for the potential presence of publication bias. In general, publication selection bias refers to the phenomenon that certain estimates are systematically underrepresented in empirical literature (Rosenthal, 1979). In other words, publication selection bias exists when researchers prefer statistically significant results or results that are consistent with the theory and previous research outcomes (Stanley, 2005). One potential source of publication bias might be the selective reporting of results depending on the number of lagged years (Bruns & Stern, 2018). Finally, we explore the heterogeneity of results by applying a meta‐regression analysis incorporating differences in measurement, study quality, regions, time, industry, data, and estimation procedures among the primary studies. This procedure should reveal the main drivers of the variation among the primary study results.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sums up the theoretical literature for the different causalities between CEP and CFP.

# 2 | THEORY OF THE CEP–CFP RELATION

For the interaction between the two dimensions, three causal directions are plausible: CEP influences CFP, CFP affects CEP, and a bidirectional relationship. Besides the direction of the effect, literature

is also inconsistent about the sign of the relation, which might be negative, neutral, or positive. In this section, we briefly present the theoretical considerations, each pointing to a certain causality between CEP and CFP, as they also underlie the primary studies included in our meta‐analytical data set. For the categorization of the existing theoretical constructs, we follow the structure by Preston and O'Bannon (1997) and Waddock and Graves (1997), which is summarized in Figure 1 and briefly outlined below.

# 2.1 CEP affects CFP

Concerning the first causal sequence, the most antiquated argument for the potential impact of CEP on CFP is known as the trade‐off hypothesis, indicating a negative influence as formulated by Levitt (1958). Thus, environmental engagement requires financial investments by the firm, which are not completely compensated by financial returns from environmental activities. These negative effects might especially occur in the short term, when the costs are realized. Because firms not investing in CEP do not have to bear these costs, following Aupperle, Carroll, and Hatfield (1985) and Vance (1975), these unfair costs might be a danger to free market economy. As the generation of financial returns constitutes the primary goal of a firm, CEP stands in a competing relationship with CFP. Research by Bragdon Jr. and Marlin (1972) complements that there is only a choice between investing in a profitable firm or a responsible firm. Conversely, the creation of additional value is the single social corporate responsibility (Friedman, 2002).

The supply and demand model, a theoretical framework modeling CFP independently from CEP and vice versa, is developed by McWilliams and Siegel (2001). It proposes the existence of an optimal investment in environmental engagement, which can be determined by cost–benefit analysis. Accordingly, the decision for environmental investments should be based on the same principles as any other investment (Barnett, 2007; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). This leads to a synthesis of interests, as not only the maximization of profitability demanded by shareholders is considered but also the claims of stakeholders for environmental responsibility, such as those of customers, employees, and communities (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). However, firms following this procedure do not exhibit higher profitability than those who do not invest in environmental activities. Assuming that all firms take optimal decisions and they are within the optimum between supply and demand, they are equally profitable. As soon as one firm has a higher return on investment, the competing company would change its product strategy (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001).

A positive impact of CEP on CFP is motivated by the Porter hypothesis. Consequently, environmental regulation might induce innovations in order to increase a firm's efficiency and competitiveness (Esty & Porter, 1998). Because pollution as an outcome of CEP can be seen as economic waste, pollution reduction contributes to a firm's profitability (Porter & van der Linde, 1995). We conclude that although innovations take time for development, firms profit from them in the long run.

Furthermore, the assumption of a positive influence of CEP on CFP by the natural‐resource‐based view (NRBV) is based on the resource‐based view proposed by Barney (1991), Hart (1995), and Wernerfelt (1984). Hence, the strategic advantages of a firm can be reduced to the access to strategically valuable resources in a firm's individual and hard to duplicate resource bundle, for example, the particular mix of management skills, business processes, routines, or knowledge and a superior utilization of the available resources (Barney, Ketchen, & Wright, 2011). However, in consideration of technological developments and changes in the environment, the concentration on core competences loses its effect, which justifies the relevance of the NRBV (Kraaijenbrink, Spender, & Groen, 2010; Tushman & Anderson, 1986). Accordingly, the competitive advantage of a firm is directly linked to how it deals with the natural environment, as responsible behavior enables a firm to gather further capabilities and new resources, such as knowledge or enhanced corporate culture (Branco & Rodrigues, 2006). Hart (1995) complements that strategy and competitive advantages are strongly influenced by the environmental performance of a firm, whereas pollution prevention, product stewardship, and sustainable development are the core drivers. Following Davis (1973), environmental responsibility consequently leads to a long‐term profit maximization followed by a better community and society.

The NRBV is supported by the instrumental stakeholder theory (Davis, 1973; Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Jones, 1995; Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003). Thus, each firm is surrounded by a network of expectations from contractual relationships, for example, from suppliers, employees, or customers. Managing these stakeholder interests leads to increasing profitability, stability, and growth (Damak‐Ayadi & Pesqueux, 2005). As Jones (1995) points out, trusting and cooperative behavior solve problems related to opportunistic behavior. Because environmental engagement can be seen as an effort to meet these stakeholder expectations, a firm has to meet these requirements to achieve financial advantages, although such behavior may seem to be economically irrational or altruistic (Buysse & Verbeke, 2003; Jones, 1995). For example, economic advantages might be greater.

customer loyalty, long‐term supply relationships, better reputation, product differentiation, and higher selling prices. We hypothesize that this effect might especially hold in the long term.

In this context, literature often refers to the social impact hypothesis coined by Latané (1981). Accordingly, a firm must not only meet explicit expectations of stakeholders as shown above but also implicit expectations such as quality service or environmental responsibility (Cornell & Shapiro, 1987). If such expectations are not fulfilled, fears and risk on the market increase and such firms may be faced with additional and more costly explicit agreements in the future, for example, as parties such as the government pass more stringent rules to ensure more environmentally conscious behavior. Because changes in the trust and contractual conditions of stakeholders are not assumed to arise in the short term, we expect these negative effects to occur in the medium to long run. On the contrary, environmentally conscious firms have more low‐cost implicit claims, resulting in a higher financial performance (McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988). Hence, environmental consciousness is a means to retain freedom in decision making (Davis, 1973).

# 2.2 CFP affects CEP

For the second causal sequence, literature provides the managerial opportunism hypothesis, which suggests a negative impact of CFP on CEP (Preston & O'Bannon, 1997). This position is grounded on the assumption that managers follow their own targets, which may not be in the best interest of the shareholders (Alkhafaji, 1989; Posner & Schmidt, 1992; Weidenbaum & Vogt, 1987). This circumstance directly leads to inefficiencies in the operating firm, which may result from wages linked to short‐term profits and stock prices (Preston & O'Bannon, 1997; Weidenbaum & Vogt, 1987). Thus, especially when a firm performs well, managers tend to increase their own income by reducing environmental investments, which we expect to affect CEP in the long run. Apart from that, managers may expand corporate environmental expenditures to compensate bad corporate performance (Preston & O'Bannon, 1997). These effects might especially occur in the short term, if a firm suffers unexpected bad business results. This managerial behavior is especially driven by a firm's compensation system. According to Preston and O'Bannon (1997), opportunistic activities are reinforced if manager salaries are linked to short‐term profits of a firm and the improvement of environmental performance is postponed for the benefit of private bonus payments. One potential solution might be the linkage of executive compensation to corporate environmental performance (Cordeiro & Sarkis, 2008).

Representatives of the slack resources theory suggest a positive impact of CFP on CEP. Hence, slack resources generated from good financial performance enable companies to invest in environmental programs (Kraft & Hage, 1990). Analogous to the NRBV, investing in environmental activities is connected with enhancing internal resources, new capabilities, and comparative advantages of the firm, as well as possibilities for differentiation through innovative and eco‐friendly developments (Bourgeois, 1981). Thus, investing slack resources also allows firms to adapt to their external environment for long‐term profitability. Although firms often want to act environmentally friendly and socially, they might be restricted by limited availability of financial resources (Preston & O'Bannon, 1997). If financial slack is only available in 1 year, there might be too little time to develop proactive environmental strategies and a firm instead invests in ecological one‐off actions.

# 2.3 Bidirectional relationship between CEP and CFP

Waddock and Graves (1997) reconciled the two previously explained causal relations, proposing the “virtuous circle”—a concurrent relationship between CEP and CFP (Waddock & Graves, 1997). Following this hypothesis, superior CEP initiates better CFP, which again allows companies to reinvest in CEP. This leads to a two‐way causality for the two constructs. The process might either begin with available financial slack or with an initial investment in environmental performance. This mutually supportive process might, however, also arise as a negative synergy (Allouche & Laroche, 2005).

# 3 EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

This section describes the search for empirical studies and the subsequent preparation of data. Second, the statistical approaches of Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis and publication bias test are presented.

# 3.1 Data search and preparation

Meta‐analysis starts with the collection of available CEP–CFP studies. First, we gathered the sample of 149 primary studies used by Endrikat et al. (2014). In the next step, we extended their sample by studies published after 2012 using the same search strategy to search major databases for published research articles and grey literature using a comprehensive search term incorporating various keywords for CEP, CFP, and applied empirical methodology. At the end, the literature search left us with 198 relevant publications.

To identify the studies that are eligible to be included in our analysis, we adopt the following set of selection criteria on the sample of relevant work:

- a. Studies examining disclosure data as proxy for CEP are dropped, because recent empirical analyses show an inconsistent and contradictory behavior in contrast to other frequently used measures as, for example, intensity of emissions (among others, Aragón‐Correa, Marcus, & Hurtado‐Torres, 2016; Hughes, Anderson, & Golden, 2001; Patten, 2002);
- b. Because statistical aggregation of empirical results of many studies requires that the effect sizes are comparable across studies (Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2012), event studies and findings from probit/logit models are excluded;
- c. Each study has to report appropriate statistical results from regression analysis including regression coefficients, the corresponding standard error (or t‐statistics), and the underlying.

The screened databases are ABI/Inform Complete, Business Source Complete, EconLit, GreenFILE, ScienceDirect, and Social Science Research Network.

sample size. This is necessary to extract the empirical effect population effect size and variation in the effect sizes only stems from between CEP and CFP in form of partial correlation coefficients. a study‐specific sampling error covered by the variance ν. However, it could be argued that the population effect size follows a normal distribution due to variation induced by random effects across the primary studies and effect estimates respectively. In order to account for such unobserved heterogeneity in the effect sizes, a random‐effects model is more appropriate incorporating a random‐effects component τ2 as shown in Equation (3). The latter is estimated by the restricted maximum likelihood estimator. This approach produces random‐effects weights calculated by the inverse sum of these two variance components. By including τ2 in the weighting scheme, the analysis accounts for typical drivers of heterogeneity in this field of research, such as measurement difference, regional differences, temporal effects, differences in study quality, study characteristics, and data characteristics. For the estimation of τ2 and further explanations of the HOMA procedure, please refer to Borenstein (2009), Carney, Gedajlovic, Heugens, van Essen, and van Oosterhout (2011), and van Essen, Otten, and Carberry (2015).

The partial correlation coefficient from Equation (1) measures the intensity of the CEP–CFP relation, while keeping constant all other variables in model.2 This effect size is preferable for our analysis due to several aspects. First, compared with the Pearson correlations, the effect of interest is corrected for spurious influences. Second, the use of Pearson correlations would lead to a smaller set of studies to be included. Furthermore, using partial correlations allows collecting multiple estimates from each study as most authors report empirical results for several regression models.

After inspecting the appropriateness of each regression analysis in the collected primary studies, the sample of 142 primary studies provides a database of 893 partial correlation coefficients, which are obtained from 757,154 firm‐year observations.3

# 3.2 | Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis

For the aggregation of reported effect estimates, we apply Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis (HOMA; Hedges & Olkin, 1985) in order to calculate mean effect sizes. Consequently, the mean effect size for a bivariate relation and its standard deviation are computed by:

r = ∑ wi × ri and wi = νi + τ2;

# 3.3 | Publication bias test

As typically applied in meta‐analysis, we investigate the presence of selective reporting of research results. Publication selection bias exists if specific estimates are systematically overrepresented in empirical literature (Rosenthal, 1979). This means that researchers favor statistically significant results or results that are in line with theory and previous research outcomes (Stanley, 2005). If publication selection bias is present in literature, the overall picture across the available literature will be distorted (Card & Krueger, 1995; Doucouliagos & Stanley, 2013).

The statistical analysis of publication bias is carried out by analyzing the relation between the observed effect sizes and their standard errors. Accordingly, the model can be formulated as follows (Card & Krueger, 1995):

ri = β0 + β1SE(ri) + εi  εi ∼ N(0, SE(ri))

The dependent variable ri is the i‐th partial correlation coefficient, SE(ri) is the standard error of the partial correlation, and εi is the error term.

# HANG ET AL.

As proposed by the Egger test (Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997), the t‐test of the regression coefficient β1 in this model investigates publication selection bias. If β1 = 0, it can be reasoned that literature is unbiased. Hence, the probability of measuring the true population effect increases with the precision of the estimates, and the reported effect estimates in the primary studies are normally (symmetrically) distributed around the true population effect. If there is statistically significant evidence that β1 ≠ 0, certain results are overrepresented, and the presence of publication bias would be confirmed.

While performing the publication bias test, the following aspects are considered in the model specification. (a) The errors of the regression might be heteroskedastic due to the usual great variation of the standard errors of the reported estimates across the primary studies. Therefore, a weighted least squares (WLS) approach is conducted using the inverse standard errors of the effect sizes as weights. Accordingly, studies reporting lower standard errors, more precise results respectively, get larger weights in the MRA estimation (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). (b) Multiple estimates per study are integrated in our meta‐analysis. For this reason, potential within‐study correlation among the effect sizes obtained from the same study has to be taken into account. Thus, standard errors are clustered at the level of each individual study (Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010). (c) We perform a random‐effects model to account for residual heterogeneity. The latter might, for example, come from deviations of the effect sizes due to unobserved heterogeneity on the firm‐level (such as management quality).

# 4 | PRESENTATION OF META ‐ANALYTICAL RESULTS

# 4.1 | Results of Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis

For the analysis of the causality between CEP and CFP, we conduct Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis measuring the effect between CEP and CFP in the form of a random‐effects mean effect size. The adequacy of the random‐effects model is especially motivated by the results from heterogeneity tests. Table 1 sums up the results given by the Q statistic (Cochran's heterogeneity statistic), I2 (percentage of total variation across studies, which stems from heterogeneity rather than chance), and τ2 (variance of the effect size parameters across the population of studies; Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003). In general, the statistics confirm that a statistically and economically significant part of the variation of effect sizes stems from heterogeneity. For this reason, the assumption of random effects seems appropriate.

The random‐effects model is applied to various subsamples of effect sizes measuring the relation between CEP and CFP depending.

on the number of lagged years between the two constructs as reported in primary studies. Following the common practice introduced by Cohen (1992), we assess mean effect sizes as economically significant, if they are greater than 0.10. The results are displayed in Table 1.

Starting with the full sample, the results show a mean effect size of 0.072, which is statistically significant at any common level. The same holds for the subsample of effect sizes measuring CEP and CFP concurrently with a mean effect size of 0.077. However, according to Cohen (1992), these effects are not economically significant.

Continuing with the causality from CEP to CFP, the full subsample has a mean effect size of 0.056, which is statistically significant. Hence, on average, the effect seems to be slightly lower compared with the full sample. If CEP and CFP are lagged by 1 year, the effect even decreases to just 0.030, statistically significant at 5%. Because the two previous values do not exceed the threshold of 0.10, we do not share the opinion of Ameer and Othman (2012), Hart and Ahuja (1996), Horváthová (2010), Makni et al. (2009), Nakao et al. (2007), and Rassier and Earnhart (2011) that CEP really affects CFP in the following year. However, the effect increases when the time lag is extended to 2 years as proposed by Hart and Ahuja (1996) and Horváthová (2010). In this case, the mean effect size is 0.110, which is statistically significant, and the mean effect size also lies above the threshold by Cohen (1992). Hence, this effect is assessed as economically significant, which allows the conclusion that increasing CEP leads to financial benefits after 2 years. As an extension of existing literature contrasting the different causalities, we continue with the effects for 3‐year and 5‐year lags. As found for the 2‐year lag, the statistically and economically significant effect holds for the time lag of 3 years. Here, the mean effect size even increases to a statistically significant value of 0.158. For a time lag of 5 years, the mean effect size again drops to 0.117, which is still statistically and economically significant.

For the causality from CFP to CEP, the mean effect size for the full subsample is 0.100, which is statistically and also economically significant. For a more comprehensive analysis, the mean effect sizes are again calculated for the different number of lagged years. At a time lag of 1 year, the mean effect size measures 0.104, which is statistically and economically significant. This result confirms the conclusions by Heras‐Saizarbitoria et al. (2011) and Nakao et al. (2007). For a time lag of 2 years, the mean effect size even gets negative with an insignificant value of −0.058. This means that increasing CEP, which stems from the availability of additional financial resources of a firm, only remains for 1 year. After 2 years, no effect is observable anymore. Furthermore, the effect remains insignificant for a time lag of 3 years with a mean effect size of 0.055.

Overall, the results suggest that increasing CEP as a consequence of additional financial resources only has a short‐term effect, which lasts 1 year. This finding is in line with the slack resources hypothesis (Kraft & Hage, 1990). Accordingly, financial slack is especially invested in eco‐friendly one‐off actions. Hence, following our results, it would

be desirable from the perspective not only of the stakeholders but also of the firm itself, to invest financial slack more wisely. In contrast, our results confirm that if a firm proactively increases CEP, it may achieve long‐term economic benefits starting after 2 years, as proposed by the Porter hypothesis (Porter & van der Linde, 1995). Due to the time lag resulting from the development and realization of environmental innovations induced by environmental regulation, the positive financial effects delay. In the same way, firms might profit in the long term from additional knowledge and resources as proposed by the NRBV (Hart, 1995) as well as from enhanced stakeholder relations following the instrumental stakeholder theory (Davis, 1973) and the social impact hypothesis (Latané, 1981). As a robustness test, all HOMA results are recalculated using z‐transformed effect sizes. As presented in Table 2, the results remain stable.

# 4.2 Publication bias test

In order to examine the robustness of our results, we perform a publication bias test as routinely employed in meta‐analysis. As a first graphical impression, we consult the so‐called funnel plots. Therein, the effect sizes (partial correlations r) are plotted against their precision (1/SE (r)). As an example, Figure 2 shows the funnel plots of the effect sizes measuring the relation between CEP and CFP for the different major (sub)samples. An unbiased sample should lead to a symmetric‐inverted funnel, indicating that the deviations of the single effect sizes from their mean value decrease with an increasing precision of their estimation. Figure 2 tends not to reject this hypothesis, as effect sizes are quite symmetrically distributed around the mean effect sizes. Solely for the last subsample of effect sizes measuring CFP as lagged independent variable, effect sizes are slightly underrepresented on the left side. However, this might be reasoned by the small sample size but could also be an indicator of publication bias.

For a more objective test of publication bias, we perform the Egger test (Egger et al., 1997) for all subsamples of effect sizes, for which a mean effect size is calculated. The results are displayed in Table 3. Accordingly, there are no significant effects, which point to the presence of publication bias. Solely for the full subsample of effect sizes measuring CEP and lagged independent variable, the publication bias test reveals an estimate of 1.142, which is weakly significant at the 10% level. Hence, the choice of time lag is no means for selective reporting of results. Overall, the analysis provides no evidence for publication selection bias.

# 4.3 Robustness test and of heterogeneity

As already noted, hitherto unobserved heterogeneity (as incorporated in the random effects component τ2 in previous analyses) is present in the field of the CEP–CFP relation. This is also empirically confirmed by the statistically significant heterogeneity test statistics displayed in Tables 1 and 2. The subsequent analysis of heterogeneity sheds light on the main reasons of differences across studies. Therefore, we first derive various moderating variables based on information from primary studies, which might cause the heterogeneity among the effect sizes. For the choice and design of variables, we follow prior meta‐analyses.

(Albertini, 2013; Dixon‐Fowler et al., 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014; Guenther et al., 2012; Horváthová, 2010). The set of variables is listed in the first column of Table 5 together with their descriptive statistics in columns two and three. After selecting the relevant moderating variables, these are included as additional explanatory variables in a meta‐regression analysis as an extension of Equation (6).

Based on the primary studies in our sample, we designed the following moderating factors including measurement differences, study quality characteristics, temporal differences, regional differences, industrial differences, data characteristics, and estimation characteristics. Following previous meta‐analyses, among the measurement differences, we classify financial performance measures in market‐based (Tobin's Q, stock return, or market value of a firm) and accounting‐based (return on assets, return on equity, or return on sales). The two measures especially differ in terms of their forward‐looking properties, which are more present in market‐based measures compared with the backward‐looking properties of accounting‐based measures. Market‐based CFP takes on the value of one if a study uses a market‐based CFP measure and zero otherwise. Furthermore, the CEP measurement is categorized by its strategic level and quantifiability. Process‐based measures refer to CEP on a management or process level. These measures cover management practices, environmental policies, or environmental innovation. On the other hand, outcome‐based measures refer to real impacts of these efforts by measuring the amount of emissions, the ratio of recycled waste to total waste, or energy consumption. Process‐based CEP takes on the value of one if a study uses a process‐based CEP measure and zero otherwise. Additionally, proactive measures refer to pollution prevention through green process design, special capabilities, or resource combinations of the firm (Walls, Phan, & Berrone, 2011). On the contrary, “end‐of‐pipe solutions” such as air filters or water clearers to comply with regulations and laws in order to minimize costs, risks, and liabilities are classified as reactive measures. Proactive CEP and reactive CEP take on the value of one for the corresponding measures. The number of citations as derived from Google Scholar serve as a proxy for study quality. In order to capture temporal effects, the mean year of the observation period in a primary study is included, and 1950 is used as base year (mean sample year—1950). Because a major part of the literature analyzes U.S. firms and E.U. firms, we incorporate two corresponding dummy variables to capture regional differences (U.S. data and E.U. data). Similarly, large parts of the literature examine manufacturing and service firms in order to reveal industrial differences. The dummy variables manufacturing sector and service sector take on the value

of one for the corresponding studies as suggested by Fujii, Iwata, Kaneko, and Managi (2013). The same also holds for small firms compared with large companies (small firms). In order to cover potential differences in the effects due to estimation differences, OLS estimation distinguishes simple OLS techniques (=1) from more sophisticated approaches (=0). Finally, the dummy variable endogeneity considered indicates if the used estimation procedure considers potential endogeneity between CEP and CFP.

For the selection of the moderating variables, we face the problem that there is no underlying theory to derive the best set of variables. Thus, we collect a broad set of variables. If we would include all explanatory variables in the same regression model, we would probably face two problems: multicollinearity and high model uncertainty. To address these issues, we follow recent developments in meta‐regression research and employ Bayesian model averaging (BMA; see, e.g., Babecky & Havranek, 2014; Zigraiova & Havranek, 2016). Instead of selecting just one of the possible regression specifications, the general idea behind BMA is to run regressions with different subsets of possible combinations of explanatory variables. Thus, BMA can be thought of a robustness check with many subsets of explanatory variables. As a full enumeration of all possible subsets of explanatory variables would require too much computing capacity, a Monte Carlo chain algorithm is applied to consider the most promising models. The distribution of the model parameters over the individual models is captured by the posterior means and standard deviations. Furthermore, we can compute the posterior inclusion probability (PIP) for each explanatory variable, which is the sum of the posterior probabilities across all regression specifications including this variable. The PIP denotes the probability that a variable is included in the “true” regression model. Table 5 reports the numerical results for the BMA in the central three columns. The posterior mean, standard deviation, and the PIP are shown in the first three columns.

In the next step, we add all moderator variables with a PIP greater than 0.2 into the multiple WLS model following Equation (6), as these variables are identified to have explanatory power for heterogeneity. The results from the WLS regression are presented in the right three columns of Table 5.

The BMA results show that mean sample year—1950 crucially affects the CEP–CFP relation with the highest PIP of 1.00 (posterior mean = −0.006). Moreover, the analysis reveals a strong impact for reactive CEP (PIP = 0.91, posterior mean = −0.082). All other moderator variables do not even reach a weak level. In the subsequent

Thereby, we follow the classification by Eicher, Papageorgiou, and Raftery (2011) and categorize an effect as “weak” if the PIP is between 0.5 and 0.75, “substantial” if the PIP is between 0.75 and 0.95, “strong” for values between 0.95 and 0.99, and “crucial” for values above 0.99.

Note. This table shows the results from Hedges and Olkin‐type meta‐analysis for the CEP–CFP relation. Data are split according to the CEP strategy applied and the mean sample year of the analyzed data, while simultaneously splitting the sample according to the number of lagged years j between the two constructs. n is the number of studies, and k is the number of effect sizes. Besides, the random‐effects mean effect sizes and their standard errors are shown. CEP: corporate environmental performance; CFP: corporate financial performance.

aDue to the small number of observed effect estimates, the calculations cannot be performed completely for this subgroup.

*Significant at 10% level; **Significant at 5% level; ***Significant at 1% level.

# 5 CONCLUSION

Extending existing meta‐studies on the relation between CEP and CFP (Albertini, 2013; Dixon‐Fowler et al., 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014; Guenther et al., 2012; Hang et al., 2018; Horváthová, 2010), the aim of this paper is to shed light on the reverse causality between both constructs by applying meta‐analysis on a sample of 893 effect sizes.

# HANG ET AL.

Our findings suggest that in the short term (1 year), financial resources can increase a firm's environmental performance as proposed by the slack resources hypothesis; however, the effects disappear in the long term (more than 1 year). Conversely, increasing environmental performance has no short‐term effect on a firm's financial performance, whereas a firm significantly benefits in the long term following the Porter hypothesis. In contrast, the concurrent/synergetic effect is significantly positive but economically insignificant. Overall, our results imply that the causality between environmental performance and financial performance depends on the time horizon. This result is not affected by publication bias. However, meta‐regression analysis reveals that the CEP–CFP relation decreases over time and is significantly smaller for reactive environmental investments. To sum up, our results should encourage managers to stick to a proactive environmental policy and not to abandon the investments if the financial success is not immediately visible.

Future research might especially point to the temporal structure of causal effects for different environmental practices on a fine‐grained level. For a more detailed understanding (also on a meta‐level), additional studies examining long‐term effects are also needed. Moreover, future studies might investigate the causality between CEP and CFP assuming non‐linear relations (Fujii et al., 2013).

# ABSTRACT

Manuscript Type: Empirical

# Research Question/Issue

We empirically examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we condition our analysis on activists’ motivations for achieving their objectives.

# Research Findings/Insights

Based on a sample of U.S. S&P 1500 firms over 1997-2011, we find that female board representation and board independence are negatively associated with the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. We further document that financially-motivated activists are more likely to target firms with extremely low female board representation than are socially-motivated activists. Targeted firms significantly increase their female board representation in the two-year period following proposal initiation, relative to that of a matched sample of non-targeted firms, with no significant differences observed across activist motivations.

# Theoretical/Academic Implications

Our findings provide empirical support for the effectiveness of shareholder activism in shaping corporate governance. Our work also suggests that shareholder activists’ underlying motivations are an important conditioning variable in governance research, with both agency theory and institutional theory providing insight into differing motivations.

# Practitioner/Policy Implications

Our findings suggest that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for increasing board diversity, irrespective of activist motivations. However, we note that mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these corporate board diversity goals in the U.S.

# INTRODUCTION

We empirically examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors (BOD) and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. These questions are motivated by recent initiatives by numerous international legislative, regulatory, and advocacy organizations directed toward addressing female underrepresentation on corporate boards. Norway was the first country to introduce a quota of 40 percent for its corporate boards, and as of 2013 at least ten countries have established legal quotas requiring a minimum percentage of women directors on corporate boards, ranging from 30 percent (in Germany)1 to 50 percent (in Israel)2. The European Union (EU), Brazil, Canada (Quebec), India, and the Philippines have similar legislation proposed or pending3. In addition, regulatory bodies in at least 20 countries have instituted “comply-or-explain” rules to encourage greater gender diversity on corporate boards. For example, firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) are required to establish measurable objectives for achieving BOD gender diversity and annually assess their progress in achieving them or explain why they have not done so, and in the U.S. the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded firms to disclose whether and how its nominating committee considers diversity in identifying nominees for directors. Advocacy organizations, such as Catalyst and 2020 Women on Boards, have also pressed for voluntary improvements in board diversity.

Concurrent with the above broad-based approaches, there has also been an increase in shareholder activism devoted to greater board diversity in recent years, particularly in the U.S., where shareholders have initiated more than 250 proposals targeting individual firms to increase female representation on corporate boards since 1997 – over 30 proposals were filed in 2013 alone. In addition, diversity resolutions filed in the U.S. in 2013 received the highest average vote (35.8 percent) among environmental and social governance categories, with

shareholder campaigns driven, in part, by the work of the advocacy group Thirty Percent Coalition. Due to their non-binding nature, shareholder proposals in the U.S. have historically been viewed as a weak mechanism to drive governance reform (Bebchuk, 2005), and while firms have been more responsive to shareholder proposals in recent years, Thomas and Cotter (2007) document that even in cases where the proposal receives a majority vote by shareholders, only 25 percent of proposals in their sample are implemented by the board. In addition, the effectiveness of shareholder proposals in improving board gender diversity has not been examined in the prior literature. It thus becomes an open empirical question as to whether shareholder proposals represent an effective means of achieving desired changes in the gender diversity of corporate boards.

We address this gap in the literature using a sample of U.S. shareholder proposals related to board gender diversity drawn from the RiskMetrics database over the period 1997 to 2011. We examine the effect of shareholder activism on board gender diversity using a one-to-one matched-sample design, taking advantage of the natural experiment created when shareholder activists target a firm for increased female representation on its corporate board. We focus our analysis on U.S. firms because proposal submissions are far more frequent in the U.S. than in other countries (Cziraki, Renneboog & Szilagyi, 2010; Judge, Gaur, & Muller-Kahle, 2010). Furthermore, the U.S. has not yet taken legislative action to address corporate governance gender imbalances, creating an opportunity for shareholder activists to intervene.

While prior literature examining the effectiveness of shareholder proposals has generated mixed results (Goranova & Ryan, 2014), we document that firms targeted by shareholder proposals calling for increased gender diversity on corporate boards experience significantly greater improvements in female board representation, relative to a matched control sample of non-targeted firms. The result from this natural experiment holds in both.

Univariate comparisons, as well as in a cross-sectional regression analysis that controls for other potential determinants of shareholder activism and board gender diversity. Therefore, our findings suggest that shareholder activism is an effective mechanism for increasing female representation on boards. We thus contribute to the corporate governance literatures on both shareholder proposals and board gender diversity by providing, to our knowledge, the first systematic evidence on the effectiveness of shareholder activism in improving female board representation. The paper also speaks to the call for research on alternative efforts to increase board diversity beyond legislative quotas, as voiced by Adams, de Haan, Terjesen, & van Ees (2015). Understanding the potential mechanisms for increasing board diversity is important as significant changes are not likely to occur quickly through organic processes.

We also examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to board gender diversity, considering the perspectives offered by both agency and institutional theory in our analysis. We find that activists target firms with significantly lower female board representation and firms with less independent boards. We also extend Judge et al. (2010) by conditioning our analysis on shareholder activists’ underlying motivations. Because campaigns for increased gender diversity may be driven by either economic efficiency or social legitimacy concerns, we characterize our sample of proposals as either financially- or socially-motivated based on activist type. We find that socially-motivated shareholder activists target firms with significantly higher levels of board female representation compared to financially-motivated activists, consistent with institutional theory predictions. These insights underscore Judge et al. (2010) recommendation that activist motivation should be taken into account in future research related to shareholder proposals. In addition, while we observe larger percentage increases in female board representation for firms targeted by financially-motivated activists, our statistical tests reveal that financially-motivated and socially-motivated shareholder proposals are equally effective in increasing board gender representation.

diversity. We thus conclude that shareholder proposals are an effective mechanism for achieving corporate governance objectives irrespective of activists’ underlying motivations.

However, we note that mean female board representation for firms two years after being targeted – 6 percent (10 percent) for firms targeted with financially-motivated (socially-motivated) proposals – remains far below the level of representation sought by various activist groups, suggesting that legislative action may still be necessary to achieve current corporate board diversity goals in the U.S.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review the theoretical perspectives and prior literature related to board gender diversity and shareholder activism and develop our hypotheses regarding the antecedents of gender diversity-related shareholder activism and its effectiveness. We then describe our research methodology and present our empirical findings. Discussion and conclusions are provided in the final section.

# THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES

Our research question addressing the antecedents and ultimate effectiveness of shareholder activism directed toward increasing corporate board gender diversity brings together two disparate streams of the corporate governance literature. However, both the board diversity literature and the shareholder activism literature have shared a reliance on two central theoretical perspectives to structure their investigations – agency theory and institutional theory. We therefore draw on both theoretical perspectives in our literature review and in developing our hypotheses.

# Board Composition and Diversity

# Agency Theory Perspectives

Agency theory (Jensen & Meckling, 1976) is arguably the dominant theoretical framework used within corporate governance research. It stems from

The separation between ownership (shareholders) and control (managers). This separation provides an opportunity for managers (agents) to act in their own self-interest by maximizing their own utility at the expense of the owners (principals).

From an agency theory perspective, the role of corporate boards is to monitor managers on behalf of shareholders, ensuring that shareholders’ interests are pursued (Eisenhardt, 1989). Agency theory recognizes that board incentives to monitor on behalf of shareholders will vary, and board independence, in particular, is viewed as a key attribute in gauging monitoring incentives (Weisbach, 1988). Boards consisting mostly of insiders or dependent outside directors are expected to be less effective at monitoring than independent boards, whose incentives are not compromised through connection with the firm. Empirical evidence attempting to establish this supposed link through improved firm performance, however, is decidedly mixed (e.g. Aguilera, Desender, Bedar, & Lee, 2015; Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand, & Johnson, 1998; Dalton, Hitt, Certo, & Dalton, 2007).

This line of inquiry has been extended to examine the role of board gender diversity in creating an effective monitoring environment. For example, in a sample of U.S. firms, Adams and Ferreira (2009) find that female directors have better attendance records than male directors, male directors have fewer attendance problems the more gender-diverse the board is, and women are more likely to join monitoring committees. They conclude that gender-diverse boards allocate more effort to monitoring. In addition, Schwartz-Ziv (2015) finds that boards that are more-gender-balanced (that is, have at least three directors of each gender) are more active than other boards, being more likely to request additional information and take initiative, such as proposing an action be taken. Others document associations between board gender diversity and a lower likelihood of earnings restatements and securities fraud (Abbott, Parker, & Presley, 2012; Cumming, Leung, & Rui, 2015), as well as higher.

# Stock Price Informativeness and Earnings Quality

While these findings suggest that board gender diversity appears to improve overall monitoring, evidence linking gender diversity to firm outcomes, especially firm performance, is more equivocal. For example, Adams and Ferreira (2009) find that CEO turnover is more sensitive to stock performance and that directors receive more equity-based compensation in firms with more gender-diverse boards, but that the average effect of gender diversity on firm performance is negative. Similarly mixed findings are reported by Carter, D'Souza, Simkins, & Simpson (2010), who report in their review of this literature that out of seven papers examining the link between gender diversity and firm performance, two find a positive relationship, three find no relationship, and two find a negative relationship.

Overall, the agency theory perspective provides consistent evidence of improved monitoring from gender diverse boards, but has not established a clear link between that improved monitoring and firm performance.

# Institutional Theory Perspectives

Institutional theory considers the processes by which structures, including schemas, rules, norms, and routines, become established as authoritative guidelines for social behavior. Within this framework, firms can be regarded as consisting of cognitive, normative, and regulative structures and activities that give meaning to social behavior. An important central assumption of this theory is that concerns regarding social legitimacy take precedence over those of economic efficiency or performance (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Scott, 2001).

From an institutional theory perspective, firms’ pursuit of social legitimacy rather than shareholder wealth ultimately leads to organizational homogenization (or isomorphism) with regard to their most visible attributes, such as board composition. Board composition will thus be determined through the prevailing organizational norms in the field; i.e., boards.

of organizations in the same institutional set will tend to be more similar to each other than to the boards of organizations outside of their set (Lynall, Golden, & Hillman, 2003). One such example of cross-country institutional isomorphism is the policy diffusion process that has taken place in Scandinavia and Europe with regard to mandating corporate board gender quotas, following Norway’s legal adoption of 40 percent quotas in 2004. A similar process occurred in the New Zealand Stock Exchange after the ASX changed its corporate governance guidelines in 2010, requiring listed companies to adopt and disclose their diversity policies (Payne & Phillips, 2014).

At the firm level, the quest for social legitimacy yields predictions for board composition. For example, prior research on organizational legitimacy implies that larger and more visible firms experience more pressure to conform to societal expectations and that elaborate relational networks among organizations and their members increase the need for greater social legitimacy (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). In addition, because having females on a corporate board can provide legitimacy in the eyes of firms’ potential and current employees, industries with a large female employment base are expected to have higher levels of female representation on boards of directors. Consistent with these predictions, Hillman, Shropshire, & Cannella (2007) provide empirical evidence that larger firms and firms operating in industries with large female employment bases are significantly more likely to have at least one female board member. They also find that firms with female directors are more organizationally complex and have more directors who sit on other boards with female directors, consistent with predictions from institutional theory.

There is also evidence that greater gender diversity of corporate boards yields positive social legitimacy outcomes. For example, Bear, Rahman, & Post (2010) document that board gender diversity is positively associated with firms’ corporate social responsibility rankings and firm reputation as measured using Fortune Magazine’s “Most Admired Companies” list.

Further, Bernardi, Bosco, & Columb (2009) find that the board gender diversity of Fortune 500 companies is positively associated with the firm being listed on Ethisphere Magazine's “World's Most Ethical Companies” list.

# Shareholder Activism

Shareholder activism is defined by Sjostrom (2008) as “the use of ownership position to actively influence company policy and practice.” Although activism encompasses activities such as letter writing, proxy battles, litigation, publicity campaigns, discussions with corporate managers, and participating in shareholder meetings (Aguilera, Desender, Bedar, & Lee, 2015), most corporate governance research related to shareholder activism focuses on the filing of shareholder proposals, a written recommendation that a shareholder formally submits to a publicly traded company, advocating that the company take a particular course of action. Under SEC rules, any shareholder holding shares worth at least $2,000 (or one percent of the market value of equity) for a year or more is allowed to submit a proposal for inclusion in a company’s proxy statement distributed for its annual shareholder meeting.

Gillan and Starks (2007) provide a summary of the history of shareholder activism and document the increasing prevalence and importance of shareholder proposals as a means of shaping corporate governance.

While in the past shareholders had typically targeted firms that were underperforming or poorly governed (Karpoff, Malatesta, & Walking, 1996), shareholder activism more recently addresses perceived deficiencies in corporate social responsibilities, including issues related to the environment, corporate political activities, or human rights violations. Increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards is one such social issue that activists have pursued with increasing frequency, with over 75 shareholder proposals calling for greater diversity filed since 2013.

As mentioned above, both agency theory and institutional theory have been brought to bear on questions related to shareholder activism. A prime example is Judge et al. (2010), who demonstrate in a multi-country study that the antecedents of shareholder activism vary with the motivation of the activist, with agency theory providing valid predictions for financially-motivated activism and institutional theory providing stronger explanations for socially-motivated activism. We thus draw upon both theoretical perspectives in developing our hypotheses.

# The Antecedents of Shareholder Activism Related to Gender Diversity

Prior research has examined the firm characteristics of female board representation. For example, Hillman et al. (2007) find that firms with female directors are larger and more organizationally complex, have more directors who sit on other boards with female directors, and are in industries with a higher proportion of women in the workforce, and Adams and Ferreira (2009) report that firms with female directors are larger, have more business segments, have larger boards, have worse performance in terms of Tobin’s Q (market value of assets over book value of assets) but better performance in terms of return on assets (ROA). However, we are the first, to our knowledge, to examine the antecedents of shareholder activism directed toward increasing female board representation. We therefore start with the most fundamental question of whether the existing level of female representation on the BOD plays a role in activists’ decisions to formally submit proposals calling for increased gender diversity.

It would seem self-evident that shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity will tend to target firms with low existing levels of female board representation, as activists target firms where problems are perceived as greatest and where the potential benefits of change are perceived as being high (Ertimur, Ferri, & Muslu, 2011). Because firms with low

female presentation would stand out relative to their peers, we expect them to be more likely to be targeted by shareholder activists than firms with high female representation. However, shareholder activists driven by ideological concerns may be less discriminating in their choice of target firms. In the extreme, such activists might target all firms where there is any gender imbalance on the board, which would constitute virtually all firms in the S&P 1500.

Financially-motivated activists may only be pursuing gender diversity goals merely to satisfy demands from clients rather than from a sincere desire to impact board composition, in which case the existing level of representation may not be the primary factor in choosing a target. To the extent that these alternative possibilities hold, this will attenuate the expected relation between existing female representation and shareholder activism, potentially resulting in no association between the two. We nonetheless offer a directional hypothesis related to existing female representation:

# Hypothesis 1a.

Higher existing levels of female board representation reduce the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity.

We further consider how activist motivations might affect the relation between the level of female representation and the likelihood of being targeted. Within the institutional theory framework, increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards would increase the firm’s social legitimacy and is thus typically viewed as a socially-motivated shareholder activist objective. However, the agency theory perspective on board diversity suggests that financially-motivated activists would also have an interest in improving gender diversity, as there is empirical evidence (cited above) that suggests that the presence of female directors improves the board’s ability to effectively monitor the firm’s managers. These findings are also consistent with Cohen, Pant, & Sharp (1998), who provide evidence that women display a higher ethical sensitivity – i.e., they are more likely to identify a questionable action as unethical, and less likely to engage in that action. In addition, Hillman (2015) argues that innate differences between men and women can improve board functioning, and Lee and

Farh (2004) find that diverse groups are more innovative and identify a broader set of alternatives for consideration, improving decision-making efficacy. Hence we expect both financially- and socially-motivated activists to campaign for increased gender diversity.

However, we expect that socially-motivated activists would have a higher benchmark for what they view as an “acceptable” level of female representation, as achievement of their social legitimacy goals would presumably require more than the token presence of a female director. To illustrate, consider a board with, say, 14 percent female directors, which is the average level of representation for S&P 1500 firms in 2013. This level of representation may be deemed as adequate by financially-motivated activists, but would fall short of the more ambitious goals of 20 percent or 30 percent female representation that have been set by advocacy organizations such as 2020 Women on Board, Catalyst of the Thirty Percent Coalition. In this instance, we would expect socially-motivated activists to still target firms for improvement if that firm had a level of “only” 14 percent representation, but financially-motivated activists may not bother because this level may be adequate in terms of achieving the monitoring benefits that gender diversity provides to firms. In other words, we expect higher existing levels of female representation for socially-motivated than for financially-motivated activists. If this is the case, then the predicted inverse relation posited in H1a will be weakened for socially-motivated activists and strengthened for financially-motivated activists. Stated formally:

# Hypothesis 1b.

The effect of existing levels of female board representation on reducing the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity is moderated (strengthened) for socially-motivated (financially-motivated) shareholder activists.

Our second hypothesis considers whether the existing degree of board independence influences the likelihood that a firm will be targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. Sonnenfeld (2002) argues that board members should be able to challenge other’s assumptions and beliefs to resist the often-strong pressure to conform with

management and other board members, but concludes that “groupthink” is relatively common in boardrooms. Janis (1972) argues that a group is especially vulnerable to “groupthink” when its members are similar, and that increased diversity improves the problem. Similarly, Milliken & Martins (1996) find that diversity reduces “groupthink”, status quo bias, and other group-based decision biases, and Schwartz-Ziv (2015) finds that CEOs are more likely to be held accountable if the board includes a critical mass of women directors. Carter et al. (2003) find that the percentage of women directors is negatively associated with the number of company insiders; similarly, Kang, Chang, & Grav (2007) report that gender diversity is positively associated with board independence in Australian firms. Because women are more likely to be independent directors – outsiders to the firm but also less similar to male board members – shareholder activists concerned about a lack of board independence may encourage greater gender diversity as an indirect means of improving independence. An alternative view is that shareholders concerned about increasing board independence could pursue that goal directly without resorting to an indirect route involving gender diversity. Also, Ertimur et al. (2011) find that activists target firms with more independent boards with compensation-related proposals. We nonetheless predict a negative relation between board independence and the likelihood of being the target of a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity. Stated formally:

# Hypothesis 2a.

Higher existing levels of board independence reduce the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity.

We again consider how activist motivation might affect this relation. Under the agency theory perspective, it is assumed that independent boards are more effective at monitoring managers and aligning their interests with those of shareholders. For example, Carleton, Nelson, & Weisbach (1998) find that TIAA-CREF views board diversity as a corporate governance issue because they believe that a diverse board is less likely to be beholden to management, hence alleviating potential agency problems within the firm.

(2002) finds that board independence is negatively associated with earnings management, which suggests that independent boards are more effective in monitoring the corporate financial reporting process, and Carter et al. (2003) document a positive relation with board independence and firm value as measured using Tobin’s Q. We therefore expect that financially-motivated activists, who are typically governed by agency concerns, to have a strong preference for board independence. From an institutional theory perspective, however, board independence is not typically a matter of social legitimacy; thus socially-motivated activists would be less driven by this concern. We thus predict that the association between board independence and the likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity is intensified for financially-motivated activists than socially-motivated activists. Stated formally:

# Hypothesis 2b.

The effect of existing levels of board independence on reducing the likelihood of being targeted by shareholder activists concerned with gender diversity is moderated (strengthened) for socially-motivated (financially-motivated) shareholder activists.

# The Effectiveness of Shareholder Activism

The effectiveness of shareholder activism has received considerable attention in the literature, and findings regarding their effectiveness are mixed. A shareholder proposal can either be withdrawn by the activist if a concession is made by management, or can go to a shareholder vote if no concession is made. For proposals that are withdrawn, there is the risk that management has merely made a symbolic offer or paid “lip service” to temporarily placate the activist (Landier & Nair, 2009). For proposals that go to a vote by shareholders at the annual general meeting, the resulting vote is nonbinding, and therefore proposals resulting in a majority vote do not necessarily result in action by management. Therefore, the effectiveness of activists is by no means a foregone conclusion. On the other hand, a majority vote can send a strong signal to management, spurring them to action.

Early studies conclude that there is little evidence that shareholder proposals create value and that they have only a limited impact on firm governance structures (Karpoff, 2001), but some of the more recent studies document that shareholder proposals are having an impact (Goranova & Ryan, 2014; Aguilera et al., 2015). Thomas and Cotter (2007) find that seven percent of shareholder proposals filed between 2002 and 2004 on governance issues such as executive compensation and corporate control are adopted by the board. Ertimur, Ferri, and Stubben (2010) find that proposals that receive a majority vote are more likely to be adopted, especially in more recent years. They report that 22.4 percent of majority-vote proposals are adopted in 1997-2001, but that this frequency increases to 36.9 percent over 2002-2004. However, this still represents a small fraction of proposals filed, as only 18.0 percent and 31.7 percent of proposals receive majority-votes during those respective time periods. Ertimur et al. (2010) also report that proposals related to board composition have the lowest rates of implementation, following shareholder rights and executive pay.

With particular regard to proposals related to environmental/social issues, Reid and Toffel (2009) find that firms are more likely to participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project if they are targeted by environmental shareholder proposals. In contrast, David, Bloom, & Hillman (2007) find that corporate social performance proposals are negatively related to subsequent corporate social performance.

However, given the more recent evidence on the growing effectiveness of shareholder activism and the increased attention on gender diversity issues, we expect proposals to have some measurable impact on female board representation. Stated formally:

# Hypothesis 3a.

There is a significant increase in female board representation after a firm has been targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity.

As with H1 and H2, we again consider how activist motivations might affect our prediction. Gillan and Starks (2000) find that proposals sponsored by institutional investors received significantly more favorable votes than those sponsored by independent individuals.

or religious organizations. Similarly, Renneboog and Szilagyi (2009) find that proposals submitted by public pension funds and investment firms garner the most votes compared to unions, religious groups and individual investors. Ertimur et al. (2010) report that proposals initiated by religious organizations have the lowest majority-vote and implementation rates relative to other activist types.

As we discuss below, we categorize public pension funds and investment firms as financially-motivated, and religious groups and individuals as socially-motivated. To the extent that weak voting support represents a misalignment of activist interest to the interests of the average firm shareholder (Gillan & Starks, 2007), we would expect proposals by the socially-motivated investor groups to be less effective in changing management behavior. Further, if financially-motivated activists do target firms with lower female representation, as predicted in Hypothesis 1b, management may feel greater pressure to improve performance on this dimension. We therefore predict the following:

# Hypothesis 3b.

The increase in female board representation after a firm has been targeted by a shareholder proposal related to gender diversity is lower (higher) for socially-motivated (financially-motivated) shareholder activists.

# RESEARCH METHOD

Details of our sample selection process are reported in Table 1. We obtain 182 shareholder proposals related to board diversity for S&P 1500 firms over the 1997-2011 period from RiskMetrics. Ending our sample period in 2011 allows us to analyze subsequent board appointments for two years following the target year. We consider both proposals that went to vote (64) and those that did not (118). Proposals may be withdrawn for two primary reasons: they may be omitted or withdrawn. Omitted proposals result when the SEC grants exclusion of the proposal because of ineligibility (typically if the proposal is vague, false or misleading, the proposal relates to the company’s ordinary business operations, the proposal...

is contrary to applicable law, a duplicate proposal exists, or on procedural grounds such as the defects in the shareholder’s proof of ownership. A proposal is withdrawn by the submitting shareholder when the firm and submitting shareholder have reached some form of agreement prior to the proposal going to vote (Carleton et al., 1998). Because withdrawn proposals often result in concessions by companies to activists, we include them in our analysis. In addition, Ferri (2012) encourages including withdrawn proposals in activism research, as excluding them potentially understates the success of activism efforts. However, in Table 2 we analyze voting patterns for the 64 proposals that went to vote to assess investor views for the different types of proposals and proponents.

------------------------------- Insert Table 1 about here -------------------------------

For our target analysis, we lose 16 proposals because board gender data is not available from RiskMetrics for the year prior to the target. We also lose 26 proposals due to missing Compustat data or where a match could not be found. The resulting sample for our target analysis is 140 proposals. In Panel B of Table 1, we identify five activist groups among the 182 proposals submitted: public pension funds (14), institutional investors (60), individuals (14), religious organizations (90) and other (4). The public pension funds include Connecticut Retirement Plans & Trust Funds and California State Teacher’s Retirement; institutional investors include Calvert Asset Management and Citizen Funds; religious organizations include the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) and the Episcopal Church; and individuals include Thomas Gniewek, Jr. and Charles and Lois Edwards.

|Activist|Type|
|---|---|
|Public Pension Funds|14|
|Institutional Investors|60|
|Individuals|14|
|Religious Organizations|90|
|Other|4|

To consider how incentives might differ across activists, we categorize our proponents into two categories following Tkac (2006), and confirm this characterization by

our own examination of the stated objectives of different activist groups, where available. We define financially-motivated activists as those whose primary goal is to pursue financial returns, and include public pension funds and institutional investors in this category. Socially responsible mutual funds, such as Calvert, also fall in this category. While these funds screen investments according to ethical guidelines, their primary goal is still financial performance (Tkac 2006). In our (target analysis) sample, 78 (68) proposals are from financially-motivated proponents.

We categorize individuals and religious organizations as socially-motivated activists. Individuals are more likely to pursue shareholder activism that stems from personal preferences, while religious organizations tend to focus on issues of social and economic justice and utilize their investments and other resources “to change unjust or harmful corporate policies, working for peace, economic justice and stewardship of the Earth” (Tkac, 2006, p. 6). Louche, Arenas, & van Cranenburgh (2012) report that religious organizations are highly driven by the impact they can have on company behavior and society and therefore do not limit the purpose of investing to financial returns. In our (target analysis) sample, 104 (72) are from socially-motivated proponents.

While our classification is inherently subjective, we consider two alternative ways to validate our approach. First we consider whether share ownership varies across activist groups. Activists with significant share holdings are more likely to place primary emphasis on financial performance of the firm. In our sample, activists only occasionally disclose within the proposal how many shares they own, and we compute mean holdings where at least five activists of a given group provide the disclosure. The average number of shares held by public pension funds is 380,230; the average number of shares held by investment funds is 12,185; virtually no individuals or religious organizations in our sample disclosed their share holdings. However, Zhou (2013) finds that individual activists hold significantly fewer shares.

than institutions, including investments funds and public pension plans. These findings suggest that we can assume that at least the public pension funds and institutional investors have more at stake financially and are therefore more likely to be driven by financial concerns.

Second, we observe how the arguments made by activists in their proposals vary by activist type to provide evidence of construct validity (see below). Our characterization is supported if the arguments made by each activist type align with our characterization of those types, and if the arguments also differ statistically across activist types.

# Shareholder/Sentiment - Voting Patterns

In Table 2, we report voting patterns for the 64 proposals that went to vote by proposal type and proponent identity. The mean shareholder vote for the proposal is 17.4 percent, with votes for any given proposal ranging from 2.3 percent to 47.5 percent. It is notable that not one proposal in our sample received a majority vote. We also report voting patterns over three separate time periods: prior to Sarbanes-Oxley (Pre-SOX), 1997-2001; following SOX (Post-SOX), 2002-2008; and following Regulation S-K (Post-Disclose), 2009-2011. SOX required increased independence of boards, which potentially created new opportunities for women to serve on boards. In 2009, the SEC introduced Regulation S-K, which enhanced proxy statement disclosures, including those pertaining to board diversity. Specifically, the “comply-or-explain” provision 407(c)(2)(vi) of this rule requires firms to disclose whether and how nominating committees consider diversity in identifying nominees for directors. As reported in Table 2, we find that shareholder support appears to be increasing over time and highest following Regulation S-K, although we have few proposals that were voted on after Regulation S-K was introduced.

-------------------------------

Insert Table 2 about here

We observe two key types of proposals: proposals that call for the company to increase diversity, either by making an explicit commitment to do so, to make greater efforts to locate qualified candidates, or to adopt a formal process of inclusiveness; or, proposals that call for the company to report on diversity, either on its efforts to diversify the board, the criteria for selecting board candidates, or on the selection process. Shareholder support does not vary significantly across these two types of proposals. We also report voting across proponent identity, with the highest support for proposals presented by institutional investors and lowest for those from individual investors.

# Why Diversity Matters - Proponent Arguments

To better understand proponent motivations and to validate our classification scheme, we compare the arguments put forth by the two types of proponents – financially- versus socially-motivated. We obtain these arguments from the text of the proposals included in the firm’s proxy statement. Results are reported in Table 3. After reviewing all of the proposal texts, we identify seven primary themes: current status on diversity, decision-making, governance, talent pool, firm value, risk, and representativeness.

Almost all proposals, including 90.9 percent of financially-motivated and 92.9 percent of socially-motivated proposals, argue that increasing diversity leads to better decision-making by considering more perspectives, resulting in more nuanced and comprehensive solutions, or being less prone to “groupthink”. The next most common argument is that diversity increases firm value, through higher accounting and stock price performance, increased competitiveness, and by making the company more attractive to the investment community.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

This argument is significantly more prevalent for financially-motivated proposals than for socially-motivated ones (90.9 percent versus 64.3 percent, p = 0.05), consistent with expectations. Also prevalent is the argument that diversity enhances the company’s talent pool and helps companies recruit, retain and promote the best people. Again, this argument is more prevalent for financial than social proposals (81.8 percent versus 50.0 percent, p = 0.05). In contrast, more social proposals argue that diversity is needed for greater representativeness, i.e. the board should reflect the shareholder base, customers, employees and the general population. A majority (61.9 percent) of social proposals include this argument, compared to 27.3 percent of financial proposals (p = 0.01). Arguments related to improved governance from increased diversity and to low existing levels of diversity are offered equally by both proponent types, and risk is only mentioned in three proposals.

The differences documented in Table 3 suggest that our classification of proposals as primarily either socially- or financially-motivated has reasonable construct validity, which is important in our formal hypothesis tests.

# RESULTS

# The Antecedents of Shareholder Activism

To examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to gender diversity, we compare firms targeted by a gender diversity proposal to a control sample of non-targeted S&P 1500 firms. As in Judge et al. (2010), we identify one-to-one matches for our sample of shareholder proposal firms based on industry, firm size, and fiscal year using the following procedure: (1) Within the same year and 2-digit SIC, we obtain matches that are within 10 percent of firm size (total assets); (2) If no match is found, we look within the same 1-digit SIC for a size match within 10 percent; (3) If no match is found, we look within the same 1-digit SIC for a size match with 50 percent. We are able to find matched controls for 140.

target firm-years. Total assets are not significantly different across the target and control groups, indicating that we have successfully matched on firm size.

To formally test our hypotheses, we estimate the following binary logistic regression:

Pr (Targeti,t) = α + αFemale Representationi,t-1 + αBoard Independencei,t-1 + βCONTROLt-1 + εi,t (1)

The dependent variable, Target, equals one if the firm receives a gender diversity-related shareholder proposal in year t, and zero otherwise. H1a and H2a predict that female board representation and board independence, respectively, are negatively associated with target likelihood. We measure female board representation (Female Representation) as the percentage of females on the board at year t-1. The independence of the board of directors (Board Independence) is measured as the percentage of board members who are classified as independent, defined as a person neither affiliated nor currently an employee of the company, at year t-1.

Following Judge et al. (2010) and Ertimur et al. (2011), we control for Firm Size, defined as the log of total assets, and Profitability, defined as return-on-assets or income before extraordinary items divided by total assets. Judge et al. (2010) note that prior profitability is higher for firms targeted with social proposals. Therefore, we expect a positive coefficient for both Firm Size and Profitability, although the coefficient for Firm Size is expected to be significantly lower than it would otherwise be if we had not already matched on size. We also control for board structure in equation (1) as this constitutes an internal governance mechanism that may affect shareholder activism (Judge et al. 2010). For example, Wu (2004) and Ertimur et al. (2011) find that smaller boards are more likely to be targeted by shareholder activists, while Carter et al. (2003) document a positive association between female board representation and board size. We therefore control for Board Size, measured as the number of board members, but make no prediction regarding its effect on the.

likelihood of being targeted by a shareholder proposal relating to board gender diversity. Adding a female board member may be more feasible for larger boards, but attaining higher female representation is also more difficult for them. As indicated in equation (1), all independent variables are measured at year t-1.

Ertimur et al. (2011) also report a marginally positive association between shareholder activism and CEO duality; i.e., shareholders are more likely to target firms with CEOs who also serve as the board chairman. We therefore include a variable for duality to control for this effect. CEO Duality is defined as an indicator variable that equals one if the CEO also serves as the chair of the board, and zero otherwise. Shivdasani and Yermack (1999) find that when the CEO is a member of the nominating committee, the board tends to be less independent, which may attract activism. We thus include the indicator variable CEO on the Nominating Committee to control for this possible effect, where CEO on the Nominating Committee equals one if the CEO serves on the nominating committee, and zero otherwise.

Board characteristics are obtained from RiskMetrics, and financial data are obtained from Compustat. Both variables are measured at year t-1.

# 4. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics for the variables of interest are reported in Table 4, Panel A. Female board representation is generally very low. The mean (median) Female Representation is only 2.9 percent (0.0 percent) for firm-years targeted with diversity proposals during 1997–2011, compared with 10.2 percent (11.1 percent) for the sample of matched control firms over the same period. This percentage is even lower for firms targeted by financially-motivated activists: here the mean (median) Female Representation is only 1.0 percent (0.0 percent). Targeted firms also have lower board independence, with mean (median) Board Independence of 61.1 percent (62.5 percent) compared with 70.4 percent (73.9 percent) for the matched controls. Targeted firms also tend to be more profitable (mean Profitability of 6.4 percent versus 3.4 percent), have smaller boards (mean of 8.89 versus...

9.79), and are less likely to have CEOs in dual chairman roles (0.64 versus 0.70) than the non-targeted controls. Regarding differences between firms targeted by financially- versus socially-motivated activists, the former tend to be smaller, more profitable, have smaller boards, are more likely to have CEO/COB duality, and are less likely to have their CEO on the nominating committee relative to the latter.

# 9. Panel B of Table 4

In Panel B of Table 4, we present Pearson correlation coefficients for the target analysis variables. The highest correlation coefficient is between Firm Size and Board Size ( = 0.59). In addition, both firm size and board size are highly correlated with female representation ( = 0.35 and = 0.34, respectively). To assess collinearity, we compute the condition numbers of the matrices of explanatory variables. According to Judge, Griffiths, Hill, Luetkepohl et al. (1985), condition numbers between 30 and 100 indicate moderate to strong dependencies. The highest condition number for our models is 21, indicating that collinearity is not a serious problem.

In Table 5, we present results from our logistic binary regression of target firm antecedents. To control for the influence of outliers, we winsorize the continuous variables Firm Size and Profitability at 1 percent and 99 percent. In Model 1, we estimate a baseline model using just the control variables and find that Firm Size and Profitability are significantly positively associated with shareholder activism, while Board Size and CEO Duality are negatively associated. In Model 2, the variables of interest are added. Consistent with H1a and H2a, we find that firms with high existing levels of female board representation and high levels of board independence are significantly less likely to be targeted by gender diversity proposals. The estimated α coefficients on Female Representation and Board Independence are -16.67 and -2.18, both significant at the 0.01 level. Notably, the R2

Increases dramatically when the two variables of interest are added, from 5.7 percent in the baseline model to 29.1 percent in Model 2.

# Model 3

In Model 3, we report results from a multinomial logit that allows for contrasts among three groups: financially-motivated, socially-motivated, and control firms. Our results are quite similar to those in Model 2. In Model 3A, where we compare firms targeted by socially-motivated activists with non-targeted firms, we find that targeted firms have significantly lower Female Representation and Board Independence than non-targeted firms. In Model 3B, where we compare firms targeted by financially-motivated activists with non-targeted firms, we find similar results. Of primary interest, however, is Model 3C where we compare firms targeted by socially-motivated activists with those targeted by financially-motivated ones. Here we find that none of the control variables is significant in distinguishing between activist type, but we do report significant differences for one of our main test variables. Firms targeted by financially-motivated activists have significantly lower Female Representation (α = -14.67, p = 0.01), consistent with H1b. This suggests that these proponents believe that they are likely to be most successful when targeting firms with few or no females on the board, that greater potential gains will accrue to these firms, or both. We do not find significant differences across the two groups for the variable Board Independence, and therefore H2b is not supported.

# Sensitivity Tests

In (untabulated) sensitivity tests, we repeat the analysis in Table 5 using a one-to-one random match to identify non-targeted control firms. The explanatory power is much higher in the random match model because of the higher significance of the variable Firm Size, which we use in Table 5 to identify matched controls but do not use in the random match model. Other notable differences are that Board Size is significantly negative in Models 2.

3A, and 3B and that CEO Duality is not significant in any of the specifications. Most importantly, the results are very similar for our main variables of interest, Female Representation and Board Independence, compared to those based on the size-industry match, i.e., they are significant in all specifications, and our inferences remain unchanged.

As an alternative specification, we also estimate Model 2 using a sample of all firm-years with the requisite data. Because we have only 143 target firm-years and 21,664 non-target firm-years in this analysis, we employ the penalized likelihood estimation, or Firth Method, as an approach for reducing small-sample bias in maximum likelihood estimation (King & Zeng, 2001). The results are very similar to those reported above in Table 5. The coefficients for Female Representation and Board Independence are negative and significant at the 0.0001 level.

Collectively, these results suggest that activists target firms with low female representation and lower board independence with gender diversity proposals. Further, we find that firms targeted by financially-motivated activists have even lower levels of female representation compared to those targeted by socially-motivated activists.

# The Effectiveness of Shareholder Activism

To assess whether shareholder proposals related to increasing gender diversity are effective, we examine female board representation from year -1 through year +2, where year 0 represents the year the sample firm was targeted. We define the variable Change in Female Representation as the change in the percentage of female members on the board from year -1 through year +2. We obtain data on female representation from RiskMetrics. For this analysis, we require sample firms/years to have all four years of data, resulting in a drop in sample size from 143 to 120. In order to attribute observed changes to shareholder activism,

we employ a one-to-one-matched pair design to control for other changes to board composition that might have occurred during our period of interest. We select control firms based on propensity score matching, which allows us to identify control firms that are most similar to our sample firms in terms of the likelihood of being targeted. The target model used to generate propensity scores is based on the most important variables in Table 5, namely Female Representation, Board Independence, Firm Size, Profitability, and Board Size. We also match by year and require the control firm to be in the same industry, defined by 2-digit SICs, as the sample firm.8

Univariate results are reported in Table 6. In Panel A we report the proportion of boards that have at least one female board member for both the 120 target and 120 non-target firms. In the year prior to being targeted, only 21.7 percent of target firms have at least one female board member; by year +2 this percentage increases to 57.5 percent. Therefore, 35.8 percent of target firms increased their female board representation from zero to at least one female board member from year -1 to year +2, an increase that is significant at the p = 0.01 level.

Control firms that had similar characteristics to targeted firms but were not targeted also show significant increases over the sample period, increasing from 35.8 percent to 52.5 percent. However, when comparing differences in differences, we find that the target firms’ increase of 35.8 percent is significantly higher than the control firms’ increase of 16.7 percent (p = 0.01).

------------------------------- Insert Table 6 about here -------------------------------

In Panels B and C, we report the proportions of boards that have at least one female board member separately for financially-motivated and socially-motivated activists, respectively. In Panel B we observe that only 6.5 percent of firms targeted by financially-motivated activists had any female board representation in year -1, while 27.4 percent of non-

Targeted firms had at least one female board member at this time, a highly significant difference at p = 0.01. While both targeted and non-targeted firms increase their female representation such that 50 percent of both samples have at least one female on their board of directors by year +2, a comparison of difference in differences shows that the increase in frequency is significantly greater for the targeted firms (p = 0.01). As shown in Panel C, 37.9 percent of firms targeted by socially-motivated activists have at least one female board member in year -1, versus 44.8 percent of non-targeted firms, a difference that is not statistically significant. The proportion of firms with any female board representation increases over the sample period for both groups; however, the increase for the targeted firms from 37.9 percent to 65.5 percent is significantly greater than the increase from 44.8 percent to 55.2 percent for the non-targeted firms (p = 0.01). These findings suggest that both financially- and socially-motivated activists are successful in achieving goals related to increasing gender diversity.

In Panels D through F, we report the mean percent of female board representation for targeted and non-targeted firms. Results are similar to those reported in Panels A through C. In Panel D we report changes for the full sample. As previously noted, both groups have markedly low female representation in year -1: 3.0 percent for sample firms and 4.4 percent for control firms. Again, both groups show significant improvements: target firms increase by 5.1 percent to 8.1 percent (p = 0.01) and non-target firms increase by 2.9 percent to 7.3 percent (p = 0.01), with the increase for target firms being significantly higher (p = 0.01). However, it is striking that female board representation remains relatively low at 8.1 percent for target firms in year +2.

We report changes in female representation for financially-motivated proposals in Panel E and for socially-motivated proposals in Panel F. Here the results confirm the earlier findings in Tables 4 and 5 – financially-motivated activists target firms with almost no female representation.

board representation and with significantly lower female board representation than non-target firms. Female board representation for target firms increases by 5.5 percent, from a mere 0.9 percent to 6.4 percent, compared to an increase of 3.5 percent for non-target firms. For socially-motivated firms, target and non-target firms are similar in year -1 (5.3 percent versus 5.7 percent), but once again target firms increase more significantly than non-target firms – by 4.7 percent to 10.0 percent compared to an increase of 2.3 percent to 8.0 percent for non-target firms. The differences in differences in Panels E and F are significant at the p = 0.10 and p = 0.05 levels, respectively.

These findings speak to the effectiveness of shareholder activism in this setting. While not one proposal that went to vote received a majority vote, many firms took action following the proposal, with almost 36 percent of firms increasing their female representation from zero to at least one for the period surrounding the proposal.

In addition to the univariate comparisons in Table 6, we perform a cross-sectional regression analysis of changes in female representation. Although we select the comparison group for the effectiveness analysis in Table 6 to include only those S&P 1500 firms that have the most similar propensity to be targeted as our sample firms, this additional cross-sectional analysis provides further assurance that other differences across the two groups are not driving our results. We define the dependent variable as the change in the percentage of female representation (Change in Female Representation) from year -1 to year +2 and regress is on the indicator variable Target and the set of independent variables used in the target antecedent analysis in Table 5.

Proposals are an effective means of increasing female board representation, after controlling for the effects of other potential determinants of increased representation.

The results are presented in Table 7. To control for outliers, we winsorize the continuous variables at 1 percent and 99 percent. We present five model specifications. In Model 1, we include all the control variables and report a significantly positive coefficient on Target (α = 0.02, p = 0.05), consistent with H3a. Only two control variables, Board Size (β = 0.01, p = 0.01) and existing levels of Female Representation (-0.34, p = 0.01), are significant determinants of increased representation. These findings are consistent in Model 2, where we drop Firm Size and Profitability control variables due to concerns about collinearity. (When we drop these variables, the highest condition index drops from 34 to 21.) These results confirm the findings in Table 6 that demonstrate the effectiveness of shareholder activism in increasing female representation.

We perform additional tests in Models 3 – 5. In Model 3, we add indicator variables for the time period following SOX (Post Sox), 2002-2008, when requirements for board independence increased; and following Regulation S-K (Post Disclose), 2009-2011, when enhanced proxy statement disclosures requirements, including those pertaining to board diversity, were introduced. In contrast to the descriptive evidence reported in Table 2 of increased shareholder support over time, we find no evidence of higher firm responsiveness over time. In particular, we do not see increased responsiveness leading up to or following the enhanced disclosure requirements of Regulation S-K. In Model 4, we add an interaction term Target*Social Proponent to test whether activist type affects the effectiveness of the proposal in increasing female board representation, as prior research has shown that social activism tends to be less effective than financial activism (Goranova & Ryan, 2014). In this model, the coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant, and the coefficient on Target remains significantly positive. It thus appears that socially-motivated and financially-

motivated activists are equally effective in improving gender diversity, contrary to Hypothesis H3b.

In the foregoing analysis, we included shareholder proposals both that went to vote and those that did not, in accordance with Ferri (2012), who recommends consideration of both outcomes in activism research. He argues that excluding withdrawn proposals from the analyses potentially understates the success of activism efforts. In Model 5 we add an interaction term Target*Vote, to determine whether the proposal outcome (vote versus withdrawn) affects proposal effectiveness. Vote is defined as an indicator variable equal to one if the proposal went to vote, and zero otherwise. Here the coefficient on the interaction term is insignificant, and the coefficient on Target remains positive.

For these additional analyses in Model 3 to 5, we acknowledge that low statistical power may contribute to our lack of results due to the relatively small sample size. However, the consistent results for our main variable of interest, Target, gives us confidence that shareholder proposals are indeed an effective means of increasing gender diversity on corporate boards, despite the fact that none of the proposals in our sample received a majority vote.

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this study, we examine the antecedents of shareholder activism related to increasing the gender diversity of corporate boards of directors and whether such activism is an effective mechanism for achieving this goal. Prior research on the antecedents and outcomes of shareholder activism has not specifically addressed the issue of board gender diversity, despite its growing importance internationally. Goranova and Ryan’s (2014) recent review of the shareholder activism literature reveals that while there are numerous prior studies that examine the antecedents of corporate governance shareholder proposals at a

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

At a broad level, there is not a single paper that focuses directly on gender diversity issues. Similarly, activist researchers have explored outcomes as varied as market reactions to shareholder proposals, firm operating performance, CEO turnover, managerial entrenchment, executive pay, and corporate social performance, yet no extant study, to our knowledge, has examined board gender diversity as an outcome of shareholder activism. We contribute to the activism literature by filling this void.

We find that the existing levels of female board representation and board independence are significant antecedents of activism and that female board representation is a stronger antecedent for financially-motivated activists than for socially-motivated activists. In addition, our evidence shows that shareholder proposals are effective in increasing board gender diversity – the female board representation of targeted firms increases significantly more in the two-year period following initiation of the proposal related to a sample of matched, non-targeted firms. This finding holds in univariate tests, as well as in a multivariate regression that controls for the level of female board representation prior to the target year and other potential determinants of female representation. We also find that both financially- and socially-motivated activism are equally effective in improving board gender diversity. These latter results contrast with findings in the prior literature that report that activism related to social issues such as gender diversity generally tend to be unsuccessful. They further challenge the seemingly accepted notion that financial activists tend to be more effective in achieving their goals than social activists.

While these findings extend the academic literature on shareholder activism, they also have potential implications for managers, activists, and policy-makers. For managers, the knowledge that low female board representation attracts activists and that both financially-motivated and socially-motivated activists are successful in improving gender diversity may lead them to improve board gender diversity without the impetus of a formal shareholder.

proposal. For activists, the knowledge that prior activists have been successful in improving gender diversity may inspire new initiatives, particularly for socially-motivated activists.

However, we note that while our results indicate that shareholder activism is an effective means of improving corporate board gender diversity, mean female board representation for both targeted and non-targeted firms remains far below the 20 percent or 30 percent thresholds that are sought by various activist groups, even in the post-proposal period. For policy-makers, this suggests that legislative action may be necessary to achieve these more ambitious goals. To best inform policy-makers, more research is needed to understand the consequences of alternative regulatory responses, from mandated quotas to “softer” initiatives including “comply-or-explain” disclosure requirements that have been introduced in recent years (Adams et al., 2015).

Future research can also help us better understand the antecedents and consequences of female board representation. Hillman (2015) asks whether the different outcomes of increased female board representation depend on how the increase was achieved. For example, does the role that women play on the board, such as committee membership or board tenure differ depending on whether the female appointment is voluntary, through the introduction of a legal quota, or as a result of activism? Does the method of appointment affect other outcomes, such as subsequent firm performance and board monitoring? That is, is the method of appointment a moderating variable between female representation and outcomes? Also, does female board representation increase female representation at other levels within the firm (Ferreira, 2015) and does this depend on how the increase is achieved?

Further, is shareholder activism an effective mechanism for addressing broader gender inequities such as equal employment opportunity reporting for all levels within a firm? Future work is needed to address these important questions.

# Future Work and Limitations

Several areas for future work also arise from the inherent limitations of our study. We have relied on two theoretical perspectives in framing our analysis – that of agency theory and institutional theory – but acknowledge that other theoretical perspectives might also afford insight into gender diversity questions. For example, resource dependency theory or social network theory might also provide equally useful perspectives in this line of inquiry. Future research might consider related questions from these alternative vantage points.

A second limitation is that we dichotomize our sample of shareholder proposals into two groups based on the motivation of the activist (i.e., either financially- or socially-motivated). However, motivations cannot be observed directly, and we must infer motivation from stated objectives of activist groups. While we conduct two tests to gain confidence that our classification scheme has reasonable construct validity, there may be some measurement error in determining activist motivation. Alternative research methods for exploring the motivations of activists, including field-based studies, could be useful here.

Also, our findings likely understate the effectiveness of shareholder activism in this setting. The proposals we examine call for both gender and racial diversity, but restrictions in the RiskMetrics database preclude us from evaluating outcomes regarding race over our period of interest. Therefore, we are unable to tabulate improvements to board diversity related to racial diversity. Future research might address the question of racial diversity and shareholder activism.

As a last point, while we focus on shareholder activism, Aguilera et al. (2015) propose that internal mechanisms, like board structure and ownership structure, and external mechanisms, like shareholder activism or media, can work together to improve governance effectiveness. An example would be the confluence of an active board, activist shareholders, and high levels of media scrutiny working together to influence strategic decisions and firm.

outcomes. Therefore, future research could identify different configurations of internal and external mechanisms to better understand the drivers of effective corporate governance.

The Thirty Percent Coalition is an organization of institutional investors, members of the business community, and women’s organizations whose goal is to reach 30 percent female representation on public company boards by the end of 2015. Female board representation for S&P 1500 firms was 14 percent in 2013, compared to 7 percent in 1997 (RiskMetrics).
5. Cziraki, Renneboog, & Szilagyi (2010) report that the frequency of proposals is just over 4 percent of publicly-listed companies in the U.S. over 1996-2005 but only around 1 percent in the UK and Continental Europe. Similarly, Judge et al. (2010) find that in a sample of over 9,000 shareholder activism incidents in over 10 countries, 52 percent occur in the U.S.
6. While the focus of our paper is on gender diversity, the shareholder proposals in our sample typically call for increased representation from “women” and “minorities” / “persons of color”. Because we are not able to identify board members from minority groups through RiskMetrics of the majority of our time frame, we are not able to compare our sample to S&P 1500 firms on this dimension.
7. We do not include time period controls in Table 5 since we match on year, in effect controlling for time effects in Models 1 and 2. However, in sensitivity tests, we add indicator variables for the time period following SOX (Post Sox), 2002-2008, when requirements for board independence increased; and following Regulation S-K (Post Disclose), 2009-2011, when enhanced proxy statement disclosures requirements, including those pertaining to board diversity, were introduced. Post Sox and Post Disclose are not significant in Models 1 or 2, as expected. However, we find both variables to be positive and significant in Models 3B and 3C, suggesting that financial activists are more likely to target firms in later years. Further, when we control for these time periods, Board Independence approaches significance in Model 3C (p = 0.12 in two-tailed tests) providing weak support for Hypothesis 2b.
8. Mean values (p-values for difference) for target and non-target firms for the independent variables are: Female Representation of 3.0 percent versus 4.4 percent (p = 0.01); Board Independence of 61.1 percent versus 61.8 percent (p = 0.70); SIZE of

8.186 versus 7.923 (p = 0.12); Profitability of 0.070 versus 0.078 (p = 0.31); and Board Size of 8.783 versus 8.858 (p = 0.81). Therefore, target firms are equivalent on all dimensions except female representation. Although we always select a match with the closest propensity score in absolute value terms, our target firms have significantly higher scores than our control firms (p = 0.01) and are higher in 2/3 of the 120 cases. We attribute this to the fact that our sample firms often have the highest propensity to be targeted among all the firms in industry. These statistics underscore our finding in Table 5 that activists target firms with unusually low female board representation. Also, while non-target firms have significantly lower female representation than S&P 1500 firms on average, they are still not as low as our sample firms. We conduct additional tests in Table 7 to control for Female Representation.

# Can Socially Responsible Investments Be Compatible with Financial Performance?

# Abstract

This paper examines whether socially responsible investment (SRI) outperforms conventional investments by meta-analysis. The result shows that weighted average effect size is not significantly different from zero, suggesting that SRI performance is not different from conventional investments. Meta-regression results regarding sampling issues indicate that economic crisis, control group, investment universe, screening procedure, and mutual funds are important determinants of effect sizes, and publication year, author type, and control group are important factors of the absolute value of effect sizes. Regarding methodological issues, risk adjustment, weighting scheme, data refinement, benchmark model, and matching procedure are significant factors determining the absolute value of effect sizes.

Buchholz, 1978), and a significant amount of research has been accumulated so far.1 However, existing evidence shows mixed results. For example, Auer (2016) shows that investors can do financially well while doing social good based on environmental, social, and governance ratings data for the European market. However, Renneboog et al. (2008a) report that the SRI funds of France, Ireland, Sweden, and Japan significantly underperform conventional funds by 4–7% per annum during the period 1991–2003. In addition, there are many other papers that report no difference in performance between SRI and conventional funds (Hamilton et al., 1993; Kreander et al., 2005; Kempf and Osthoff, 2008; Hoepner and Schopohl, 2018).

It is imperative to determine the overall influence of SRI on investment performance, because if the impact is positive, investors will voluntarily participate in socially beneficial investments and government does not have to intervene in the market to promote social goals. If the impact is negative, however, investors have to sacrifice their investment benefits to pursue their social preferences and the public sector has to intervene in one way or another to encourage SRI activities. The direction and magnitude of SRI influence can also have a profound implication for financial industries with respect to product development, asset management, fiduciary duty, performance evaluation, and so forth. Understanding the impact of SRI is also important to academic research. As Combs et al. (2011) point out, without a proper synthesis of existing literature more fruitful further research is difficult.

Despite this, there have been few attempts to synthesize existing literature on SRI and even these have not been successful. For example, Rathner (2013) lacks representativeness due to a small sample size and incomplete methodology. Revelli and Viviani (2015) performed a meta-analysis based on 85 studies. However, they fail to draw a sharp conclusion due to ambiguity caused by pooling several countries in one sample. López-Arceiz et al. (2018) show that culture is an important determinant of SRI influence, so combining countries with different cultural backgrounds will prevent researchers from obtaining a correct picture of SRI.2 More importantly, they analyze the impact of moderators only on effect size (hereafter, ES) ignoring the impact on the absolute value of effect size (hereafter, AES).

1 SRI is different from corporate social responsibility (CSR). CSR focuses on corporate social activities and papers on CSR examine whether firms can improve financial performance by engaging in socially desirable activities. SRI focuses on investment strategies that employ various screening procedures (e.g., positive, negative, and best-in-the-class) based on so-called ESG (environmental, social, and governance) criteria and papers on SRI compare the investment performance of these portfolio strategies with conventional ones.

2 Moreover, their study seems to have multiple errors. For example, they include Smith (1996), which is an event study, even though they explicitly mention that they do not include event studies in the text. Gregory et al. (1997) have a Hedges’ g value of 0.24 in their Appendix, but the sign should be negative since the ethical funds performed worse than the non-ethical funds.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

Although many valuable conjectures can be made regarding AES. This point is especially important in the current situation where positive and negative effects coexist, since focusing only on the level of ESs will average out positive and negative impacts leading researchers to underestimate the impact of SRI. To our knowledge, our paper is the first that investigates the influence of moderators on both ESs and AESs.

Another reason for the lack of sound summary papers is the diversity and complexity of existing studies with regard to samples, methodologies, performance measures, investment universe, benchmarks, etc. A meta-analysis is a very useful scientific tool to synthesize a wide variety of heterogeneous papers. It calculates ES that can be interpreted as a standardized difference between performances of SRI and conventional portfolios. By standardizing performance differences, whatever the performance measures, a common measure of difference between the two types of portfolios is generated, making synthesis possible across very diverse papers.

Given the situation in SRI research, this article attempts to achieve the following goals. First, we provide a sound synthesis of existing literature which shows an overall influence of SRI on investment performance in terms of sign and magnitude through a meta-analysis. Then, we examine a variety of determinants of SRI influence, since it is conceivable that the magnitude and direction of SRI effects may have a systematic relationship with sample characteristics and research methodologies. The analyses on moderators will help us to produce interesting implications for future research and practice. When performing the analysis, we carefully explain our meta-analysis and data collection process to ensure replicability.

This study is organized as follows. In the next section, we develop hypotheses regarding the overall impact of SRI and moderators that can have a systematic relationship with ESs and AESs. In Section 3, we explain the meta-analysis and the concept of ES and show definitions of moderators used for hypothesis testing. In Section 4, we present our sampling process in detail, since sampling is crucial in performing and interpreting a meta-analysis. Section 5 reports the meta-analysis results, and Section 6 presents conclusions and discussions.

# 2. Hypotheses

Our initial research interest is on the average impact of SRI on investment performance. Thus, we first propose a hypothesis on the overall ES and then proceed to establish hypotheses for moderators that may have a systematic relationship with ESs and AESs. We attempt to employ moderators to reflect research characteristics as extensively as possible based on theory and practice. We split the moderators into two broad categories: sampling and methodology. Sampling relates to data collection, and methodology is about analysis tools.

# 2.1. Overall Effect Size

The CSR literature shows that CSR firms perform better than non-CSR firms (Wu, 2006; Margolis et al., 2009). Since SRI invests more in CSR firms, the performance of SRI will be higher than conventional investments. SRI performance can also be better since SRI fund managers may have a deeper knowledge of their investment pools (Girard et al., 2007; Gil-Bazo et al., 2010). SRI screening eliminates unethical firms from the investment universe, and fund managers can focus on a relatively small number of firms. In fact, Kacperczyk et al. (2005) show that more concentrated portfolios produce a higher return than broadly diversified portfolios. SRI fund turnover is lower since SRI investors are more loyal to social values than conventional investors, and the resulting lower transaction costs also predict a better performance.

On the other hand, portfolio theory predicts an inferior performance of SRI portfolios. Other things being equal, SRI constraints on the investment universe will lead to a less favorable efficient frontier, sacrificing diversification benefits (Girard et al., 2007; Renneboog et al., 2008a). For example, excluding sin stocks can cause investors to sacrifice returns, since they generate a higher risk-adjusted return than conventional stocks (Fabozzi et al., 2008; Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009; Durand et al., 2013; Borgers et al., 2015). The higher transaction costs and management fees of SRI funds also predict an inferior performance, since they are relatively small, losing economies of scale (Bauer et al., 2005; Barnett and Salomon, 2006). Ayadi et al. (2011) find that the average expense ratio of Canadian SRI fund is 1.97%, which is much larger than the 1.29% global benchmark for conventional funds.

Finally, any impact of SRI cannot be justified theoretically. The efficient market hypothesis predicts that SRI portfolios and funds cannot produce abnormal returns, since investors and fund managers can easily replicate ethical screening procedures which are public information. Even though some SRI funds seem to outperform conventional funds, their performance superiority may vanish if transaction costs are subtracted.

On the empirical side, evidence is also mixed with positive (Hickman and Teets, 1999; Guenster et al., 2005; Brander, 2006; Kempf and Osthoff, 2007; Galema et al., 2008; Peiris and Evans, 2010) and negative (Mueller, 1991; Girard et al., 2007; Durand et al., 2013) impacts for SRI. In addition, there are many papers reporting no impact. For example, Kreander et al. (2005) uncover similar performances between SRI and conventional funds when they investigate the SRI funds of seven European countries. Bauer et al. (2007) examine a sample of Canadian ethical funds and again find no significant difference between SRI and conventional funds. In addition, there are still many papers that report no difference between SRI and conventional investments (Sauer, 1997; Hutton et al., 1998; Benson et al., 2006; Kempf and Osthoff, 2008; Renneboog et al., 2008a; Humphrey et al., 2016). Therefore, we establish a null hypothesis on the overall effect of SRI as follows.

# Hypothesis 1.

The influence of SRI will not be different from zero.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

# 2.2. Sampling Issues

# 2.2.1. Time

Among various sampling issues that generate the SRI performance documented in many studies, the first-order effect could be caused by the change in the conceptualization of social responsibility. Over the past three decades, not only firms but also investors have changed their views on CSR. In earlier years, the CSR strategy may have been adopted by innovative firms and the SRI strategy, including these firms, may have outperformed conventional investment strategies. However, the relative advantage of SRI may have weakened over time since the uniqueness of SRI has decreased as more firms promote CSR activities. This process will lead to a lower abnormal return over time. It is also possible that investing communities will learn from academic studies. As more investors use SRI investment strategy via the learning process, the return can diminish. Consistent with this argument, Hoepner and Schopohl (2018) show that estimates for the impact of SRI become marginally significant or lose their significance over the sub-period 2008–2015 when compared with the entire sample period 2001–2015.

However, the dampening impact SRI process may not be a uniformly decreasing one, but rather alternate in sign. Research in general tends to show three dialectical stages of development (O’Connor, 2003). A thesis is posited in the beginning and it gives rise to its reaction, an antithesis, which contradicts or negates the thesis. Finally, a synthesis resolves the tension between the two. We can expect that research in the SRI area may also follow a similar pattern. Since the merits of SRI were overemphasized in the beginning, an argument of negative impact shows up as an antithesis which is followed by a synthesis that supports no or less impact. As for the degree of fluctuation, it will decrease over time. Since methodologies have become more sophisticated over time, any spurious difference in performance between SRI and conventional portfolios caused by misspecification of methodologies will become smaller over time. Thus, we establish the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 2-1. ESs are positive in the beginning and change signs with decreasing absolute value.

During times of economic crisis, portfolio performance reduces compared to normal periods. The SRI performance will follow a similar pattern and the ESs computed from the sample period including a crisis will be different from those in normal periods. Thus, we establish the following hypothesis.

Hypothesis 2-2. Papers whose sample periods include a crisis period will show smaller ESs than papers whose sample periods do not include a crisis.

# 2.2.2. Publication

One of the important considerations in meta-analysis regarding sampling is publication bias. As the phrase “Publish or Perish” signifies, publication is imperative in academia (Zivney and Bertin, 1992). Since so many papers are submitted, academic

Journals have become very selective and papers with a high statistical significance are more likely to be published than papers with insignificant results (Song et al., 2000). According to Stanley (2005), we can suspect that type II selection error, that is, a tendency to report significant results excessively, exists if the values of standardized ESs exceed 1.96 more than 5% of the time. Other things being equal, if a publication bias exists, published papers will have higher ESs, either positive or negative. In order to check whether our sample has publication bias, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 3.

The AESs for published papers will be higher than those for unpublished papers.

# 2.2.3. Author type.

Papers written by professional managers and scholars can show differences in ESs since they are quite different in various respects, including incentives for performing research. For example, Vaihekoski (2004) mentions that academic researchers are, in general, concerned with aspects related to asset pricing, whereas institutional investors are primarily interested in detecting opportunities that can generate superior risk-adjusted performance. Asset pricing is closely related to the efficient market hypothesis, and insignificant differences between SRI performances and conventional portfolios can be accepted as confirming market efficiency. However, if a large difference is found between the two performances, justification regarding the causes of the difference is often quite challenging. Among industry professionals, however, market efficiency is not accepted as a norm, so researchers from financial industries may pay more attention to finding profit potential than supporting market efficiency. Therefore, we conjecture that researchers in academia tend to find a smaller performance difference between SRI and conventional groups than industry professionals. In order to test this argument, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 4-1.

The AESs obtained by academic researchers will be smaller than those obtained by industry researchers.

It is possible that researchers in different disciplines may have different perspectives on SRI and this will lead to a systematic difference in their research outcomes. For example, researchers in the finance area may focus more on profit maximization and argue against the benefit of SRI, while researchers in other areas such as business ethics may think social benefits are more important than monetary benefits, advocating for SRI. To examine the impact of a difference in researcher perspectives on ESs, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 4-2.

The ESs of papers published in finance journals will be smaller than those published in non-finance journals.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

# 2.2.4. Control group.

Researchers compare the performance of SRI funds and portfolios with the performance of various control groups. For example, Muñoz et al. (2015) compare SRI mutual funds with conventional mutual funds, while Edmans (2011) compares SRI portfolios with market indexes. In general, the difference between SRI portfolios and market indexes is higher than that between SRI portfolios and corresponding conventional portfolios. Whereas SRI portfolios suffer from diversification loss due to screening procedures, market indexes do not. On the other hand, conventional portfolios are formed by an author(s) considering comparability with SRI portfolios. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 5-1.

The comparison between SRI portfolios and market indexes will have larger AESs than the comparison between SRI and conventional portfolios.

For the papers that use conventional market indexes as the control group, the treatment groups are either SRI portfolios or SRI indexes (Statman, 2006). In this case, the discrepancy between the two indexes, i.e., SRI and conventional, is smaller than that between SRI portfolios and conventional indexes. For example, the Domini Social Index is a leading market capitalization-weighted SRI index. It was created in 1990 by starting with the companies in the S&P 500 index, so many companies are included in both indexes (Di Bartolomeo and Kurtz, 1999; Brander, 2006). Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 5-2.

The AESs will be smaller when SRI indexes rather than SRI portfolios are compared with conventional indexes.

Socially responsible investment portfolios have a less favorable risk–return trade-off due to diversification loss (Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009; Statman and Glushkov, 2009). When market portfolios are used rather than conventional portfolios composed by researchers as a control group, the degree of diversification loss is relatively larger. This leads to the following hypothesis regarding ESs themselves.

# Hypothesis 5-3.

Experiments using market index as a control group will have smaller ESs than those using conventional portfolios as a control group.

# 2.2.5. Investment universe.

Cultural elements are important in studying the impact of SRI (Hill et al., 2007; López-Arceiz et al., 2018). Since fund managers will adopt investment strategies that incorporate values appreciated in their culture (Louche and Lydenberg, 2006), SRI funds can appeal more strongly to regions with a similar cultural background than to other countries with different cultural backgrounds. Indeed, Jones et al. (2008) find that SRI funds with a high exposure to international capital markets underperform the market by 3% per annum. Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.

© 2019 Korean Securities Association

# C.-S. Kim

# Hypothesis 6.

The performance of domestic SRI funds will be better than international SRI funds.

# 2.2.6. Screening procedure.

Funds using negative screening exclude unethical firms, and sometimes even entire industries, from their portfolios, causing a sharp shrink in the portfolio frontier. Moreover, since sin stocks seem to perform better, SRI based on negative screening will result in a worse performance than conventional investment (Fabozzi et al., 2008; Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009). This problem is less severe in the case of positive screening, since fund managers can add SR stocks to their existing portfolios. Even when SRI managers select stocks purely based on positive criteria, they may perform better than broadly diversifying fund managers since they may have an intimate knowledge of SR stocks (Kacperczyk et al., 2005; Girard et al., 2007). Based on these arguments, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 7.

Funds employing a positive screening procedure will outperform those with a negative screening procedure.

# 2.2.7. Mutual funds.

In existing literature, many authors study the performance of SRI mutual funds (Geczy et al., 2005; Chang and Witte, 2010; Climent and Soriano, 2011; Muñoz et al., 2014), while others study SRI portfolios formed by themselves (Diltz, 1995; Gompers et al., 2003; Core et al., 2006). There can be differences between the two types of research since it is well known that managed funds rarely beat the market (Jensen, 1968; Ferson and Schadt, 1996; Ferson and Warther, 1996; Carhart, 1997). In addition, funds formed by researchers do not consider market frictions such as liquidity constraints and transaction costs explicitly, which is not the case in the analysis of mutual funds (Adamsson and Hoepner, 2015). Based on these arguments, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 8.

ESs from examining SRI mutual funds will be lower than ESs from examining portfolios formed by researchers.

# 2.3. Methodological Issues

Effect sizes can also vary with methodologies employed. In particular, under efficient capital markets, there should not be a performance difference between SRI and conventional portfolios if all relevant factors are considered. However, if some important determinants are omitted by methodological misspecification, it will.

Although methodological issues exist for most asset pricing/capital market studies, they are particularly important in the meta-analysis of SRI. The result on SRI performance can be systematically different depending on the research methodologies used. Thus, investigating the impact of methodological difference on ESs from a variety of different angles can significantly enhance our understanding of SRI.

produce a spurious difference in portfolio performances. For instance, Gregory et al. (1997) reveal that the outperformance of UK SRI funds found in previous studies disappears when they improve methodology by using a two-factor benchmark to control size. In general, the more rigorous the methodologies, the smaller the possible confounding effects.

Existing literature examines various methods of controlling for these problems, and this paper categorizes these into three groups, that is, variable adjustment (e.g. risk adjustment, value-weighting, splits and dividends adjustment), refining benchmark model (e.g. multi-factor model, conditional model), and matching.

# 2.3.1. Variable adjustment.

Performance proxies in the existing literature can broadly be categorized as measures with and without risk adjustment. Raw returns are the performance measure without considering risk, while Jensen’s alpha, the Sharpe ratio, and the Treynor ratio are risk-adjusted measures. If raw returns are used even though the portfolios of SR and conventional firms have different risk profiles, there can be a spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional investment because they do not reflect proper risk factors (Becchetti and Ciciretti, 2009). Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 9-1.

The AESs will be smaller when risk-adjusted performance measures are used.

When calculating portfolio returns, value-weighting is theoretically more appropriate than equal-weighting. Value-weighting schemes are also in accord with typical financial industry practice (Humphrey and Tan, 2014), and most feasible for institutional investors who constitute the largest proportion of the SRI market (Trinks and Scholtens, 2017). In some cases, results based on value-weighting are different from those based on equal-weighting. For example, Statman and Glushkov (2009) find that excess returns of value-weighted portfolios are lower than those of equally weighted portfolios. If SRI mutual funds have a higher exposure to small firms than conventional funds (Luther and Matatko, 1994; Schröder, 2003), equal-weighting schemes can generate undeserved performance differences between SRI and conventional portfolios. In order to examine this effect, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 9-2.

The AESs calculated using a value-weighting scheme will be smaller than those using an equal-weighting scheme.

When calculating returns, some papers pay more attention to data accuracy by taking dividends and stock splits into account (Shank et al., 2005), whereas other papers ignore them. Inaccurate data can cause a spurious difference between SRI and conventional portfolios. For example, if SRI funds in general invest more in small firms than conventional funds (Luther et al., 1992; Luther and Matatko, 1994), ignoring dividends may produce unwarranted differences in the performance.

of SRI and conventional portfolios. This is because, other things being equal, the SRI universe would have a lower dividend payout ratio than the conventional funds universe due to the higher investment opportunities of small firms over large firms. Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 9-3.

The ESs will be smaller when returns are calculated reflecting stock splits and dividends.

# 2.3.2. Refining benchmark model.

Several authors examine the impact of SRI in the US market using a single-index framework (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Bello, 2005). However, the single-index model can produce distorted results by not controlling factors other than market portfolio. Prior literature indicates that SRI and conventional funds are different in their investment universe and portfolio strategies, having significantly different loadings on size, book-to-market, and momentum factors (Bauer et al., 2005; Renneboog et al., 2008b). In order to take into account the difference between the two types of funds, researchers use multi-factor models (Fama and French, 1993; Carhart, 1997; Galema et al., 2008; Edmans, 2011). A spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional funds may disappear if all relevant factors are incorporated.

CAPM, the Fama-French model, and the four-factor Carhart model are unconditional models since coefficients of factors do not change over time. In practice, however, fund managers change their portfolio holdings according to changes in macroeconomic environments, resulting in dynamic risk–return profiles (Renneboog et al., 2008a). In this situation, the unconditional model may be inappropriate, hence Ferson and Schadt (1996) and Christopherson et al. (1998) propose conditional models that allow coefficients of factors to vary over time. Since investors on SRI funds may not be as sensitive as investors on conventional funds to economic environment changes, SRI funds may not adjust their portfolio holdings as quickly as conventional funds (Bollen, 2007; Benson and Humphrey, 2008). If this behavioral difference is ignored in deriving performance measures by employing the unconditional model as a benchmark, SRI performance would become spuriously different from conventional performance. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 10.

The AESs calculated using more refined return-generating models will be smaller.

# 2.3.3. Matching.

Some authors employ a matching procedure where each SRI fund is mapped with conventional funds of similar characteristics like size, location, composition, and time horizon so as to control confounding factors (Derwall and Koedijk, 2009; Ferruz et al., 2012; López-Arceiz et al., 2018). If proper counterfactuals to SRI portfolios are employed, the spurious difference between SRI and conventional performance can be eliminated. Therefore, the AESs will be smaller when matching procedure is employed.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

The above discussion on methodological issues leads to the following hypothesis.

# Hypothesis 11.

The AESs will be smaller when more sophisticated methodologies are employed.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Meta-analysis

Since positive, negative, and no effect views can all be justified theoretically, synthesizing empirical findings to obtain the true overall impact of SRI is very important to both academia and industry. A meta-analysis is a particularly useful tool for this purpose, since it reflects the magnitude of performance differences between SRI and conventional groups by calculating ESs of individual studies and reporting overall ES utilizing information on the precision of individual studies (Combs et al., 2011).

Specifically, the first step of meta-analysis is to calculate the ES for each experiment or paper using Hedges’ g as follows (Hedges, 1981):

g = PT / r  (1)

where PT (PC) is the mean performance of portfolios included in the SRI (conventional) group and r is the pooled within-group standard deviation which can be computed using the following formula:

r = √((NT - 1)VT + (NC - 1)VC) / (NT + NC - 2)  (2)

where NT (NC) is the sample size of the SRI (conventional) group and VT (VC) is the variance of the SRI (conventional) group. Intuitively, the ES can be interpreted as a standardized performance difference between the two groups whatever the performance measures are and Table 1 shows the interpretation of ESs. The value of d = 0.01 has a very small effect, while d = 2.0 has a huge effect. Although we can typically compute ESs using the above equations, there are other cases where ESs are computed using different equations. The Appendix provides a detailed explanation on how to achieve ESs in special cases.

Once we obtain the ESs of each experiment or paper, the next step is to compute the weighted ES by considering all papers in the sample so as to obtain the overall SRI impact on portfolio performance as proposed by Hasselblad and Hedges.

There are in general multiple analyses in one paper. We use the terms “analysis,” “study,” “experiment” and “comparison” interchangeably.

# Table 1 Interpretation of effect size

This table contains interpretations for magnitudes of effect size and their references. Originally Cohen (1988) suggested three groups of ESs, small, medium, and large, and the other three ESs have been appended by Sawilowsky (2009). A similar interpretation can be made in cases of negative effect sizes.

|Effect size|d|References|
|---|---|---|
|Very small|0.01|Sawilowsky (2009)|
|Small|0.20|Cohen (1988)|
|Medium|0.50|Cohen (1988)|
|Large|0.80|Cohen (1988)|
|Very large|1.20|Sawilowsky (2009)|
|Huge|2.00|Sawilowsky (2009)|

(1995). The basic idea of weighting is to give higher weights to studies with more precise ES estimates, and the reciprocal of variance for each comparison is used as weights. When aggregating ESs, we use either a fixed-effect model or a random-effect model, depending on the assumption for variability. Details are in the Appendix. In addition, we delve into the possibility that SRI impacts on financial performance may vary systematically according to moderators and thus perform meta-regression analysis (Lipsey, 2001).

# 3.2. Variable Definitions

Table 2 summarizes all moderators and variables including dependent variables, either ESs or AESs. We split moderators into two broad categories, one for sampling and the other for methodology.

# 3.2.1. Sampling.

In order to investigate sampling issues, we establish moderators for time, publication status, researcher background, control groups, investment universe, screening procedure, and mutual funds. Each moderator can have more than one variable to test a hypothesis, and variable definitions are shown in Table 2. For example, three variables are used to test publication status. Since publication bias is about statistical significance, we use two variables, Publication and Significance. In addition, we use a Quality variable to examine whether there is a systematic difference in AES according to journal quality. To examine the influence of control groups on ESs and AESs, we use two variables. SRP_CI is used to test Hypotheses 5-1 and 5-3 and SRI_CI is used to test Hypothesis 5-2.

# 3.2.2. Methodology.

As for methodology, we investigate issues related to variable adjustment (risk adjustment, portfolio weighting scheme, data accuracy), adding independent variables (multi-factor model, conditional model) and a matching procedure. To see the impact of the matching procedure, we also use two variables, Matching and Match_N. If

multiple firms are matched to an SRI sample, potential errors caused by the peculiarity of a matching firm in the case of a one-to-one match can be minimized. This will in turn reduce the spurious difference between SRI and control portfolios.

# 4. Data

Since representativeness is crucial in meta-analysis, we try to collect as many papers as possible including unpublished ones to avoid publication bias. We search databases such as EBSCO, JSTOR, Science Direct, Springer Link, Wiley-Blackwell, and SSRN, and utilize web search engines like Google Scholar. We also attempt to collect papers from many academic journals, as shown in Table A2 of the Appendix.

A detailed description of our data collection process is shown in Table A1 and a flowchart in the Appendix. We first compose keywords that are related to SRI as extensively as possible. By using the phrase “socially responsible investment,” we obtain 1,555 articles that include at least one word in the phrase. Then, we check all articles one by one to sort out those that have the potential to be included in our final list of papers. By using the next phrase, “socially responsible investing,” we have 1,226 results. Since the two phrases are quite similar, most observations are duplicates of the first search and we obtain only two additional articles that have the potential to be included in the final sample. The process continues with new phrases until we use “ethical investing,” as shown in Table A1 of the Appendix. Since too many duplicates appear by that time, we begin to use the exact phrase “social investing” to narrow down the search results. We download 151 papers from this keyword search. Another important data collection process is to scrutinize the reference section of selected papers, especially summary or synthesis papers (Renneboog et al., 2008b; Chegut et al., 2011; Capelle-Blancard and Monjon, 2014).

After potential papers are collected, we read them more carefully to decide which papers are to be included in the final sample. Since the quality of data is crucial for an accurate assessment of SRI effects, we pay very careful attention to the data compilation process. The following explains some of the steps we have taken to preserve data integrity. Further details are in the Appendix.

1. We drop qualitative analyses.
2. If there are several versions of the same paper, we use the most recent paper to avoid overrepresentation bias. For example, Derwall et al. (2004) is a working paper version of Derwall et al. (2005), and we use the latter.
3. We include studies with matching firms or studies without matching firms but with market indices as benchmarks of SRI performance.
4. We include all relevant analyses based on important dimensions such as investment universe, sub-periods, conditional versus unconditional regression, matching versus non-matching, value weighted versus equal weighted, risk-adjusted versus risk-unadjusted, one-factor model versus multi-factor model, etc.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

After this screening process, we obtain 51 papers, 18 from the keyword search and 33 from reference checking, which study the impact of SRI on financial performance in the US. López-Arceiz et al. (2018) assert that the influence of SRI varies significantly with a difference in cultural background. Focusing on the US market helps us sharpen the interpretation of results without the need to consider cultural differences. Figure S1 shows the flowchart of the selection process. The publication dates of the final sample run from 1978 to 2016.

From the selected papers, we extract 205 experiments to calculate ESs. In other words, our number of observations is the number of experiments, not papers, since each paper reports multiple analyses. For example, if a paper reports two tables of comparison between SRI and conventional funds, with one based on raw return and the other based on Jensen’s alpha, we end up having two observations. Since a paper often reports results based on various subsamples, different experiments of the same paper can have different values for the number of firms, sample period, and all other relevant variables. We report detailed information including ESs on all 205 experiments in Table A2 of the Appendix.

# 5. Results

# 5.1. Results on Effect Sizes

Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of ESs calculated from 205 comparisons. The median and mean ESs are 0.015 and 0.016 that can be interpreted as having very small ES according to Table 1. This result is consistent with many existing papers (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Humphrey et al., 2016). They find no significant difference in the performance of SRI and conventional funds in the US market, even though they examine different samples and time periods. The distribution of ESs is not normal since skewness and kurtosis are significantly different from normal distribution.

The first result of interest in our meta-analysis is the overall value of ESs that allows us to judge the impact of SRI on investment performance. In order to calculate the weighted ES, we use the reciprocal of variance of each comparison. Table 4 shows weighted ESs from running fixed and random-effect models. The weighted ES from the fixed-effect model is 0.068 and is statistically very significant. Although this result clearly indicates that the influence of SRI is negative to portfolio performance, it can be interpreted as having a very small effect economically.

This table shows weighted ESs and its 95% confidence interval from fixed- and random-effect models. It also reports test statistics for the appropriateness of using the random-effect model, Cochran’s Q or I2 statistic. *** represents statistical significance levels at the 1% levels, respectively.

|0.031|0.054|

Heterogeneity chi-squared = 4058.62*** (d.f. = 204) p = 0.000

I2 (variation in ES attributable to heterogeneity) = 95.0%

Test of ES = 0 : z = 18.16 p = 0.000

Test of ES = 0 : z = 0.51 p = 0.607

According to Table 1. Besides, the test statistic to judge between the fixed- and random-effect models, Cochran’s Q, strongly suggests that the random-effect model should be used in order to control heterogeneity among different studies. The value of I2 indicates that 95% of total variance is caused by between-study heterogeneity.

For the random-effect model, the variance used to calculate weight is the sum of within-study variance and between-study variance. In Table 4, the between-study variance is reported as s2, 0.0764, which is quite large. Unlike the result of the fixed-effect model, the weighted ES from the random-effect model is positive in sign, but the size is negligible and lacks statistical significance. This result largely supports Hypothesis 1 and is consistent with the evidence in many empirical papers on SRI (Sauer, 1997; Bello, 2005; Kreander et al., 2005; Bauer et al., 2007; Gregory and Whittaker, 2007).

Although the overall ES is not significantly different from zero, ESs can be systematically different depending on the moderators. We first report the results for moderators associated with sampling issues and proceed to present the results for moderators related to methodological issues. Predictions for moderators and empirical results are summarized in Table 2.

# 5.2.    Results on Sampling Issues

Table 5 shows AESs and ESs in each decade from the 1970s. ESs are very positive in the beginning. The SRI movement has been initiated by social activists and religious groups who emphasize various merits of SRI. However, the initial positive atmosphere has weakened as more firms engage in CSR activities and SRI performance undergoes more rigorous scrutiny by many researchers and investors, leading to a smaller SRI impact over time. In addition, the impact of SRI tends to decrease.

# Table 5 Changes in the absolute value of effect sizes

This table reports descriptive statistics for the changes in the absolute value of ESs and ESs themselves through decades. The first column indicates each decade from the 1970s. There is no result for the 1980s because our sample does not have any paper published in the 1980s.

|2010s|ES|57|0.053|0.242|1.295|0.471|

with alternating signs, and both AESs and standard deviation tend to decrease over time. This result supports Hypothesis 2-1 in that researchers find a smaller impact for SRI over time and the disagreement among them has become smaller, too. The trend of finding a positive impact of SRI is followed by an average negative impact of SRI in the next decade, which is again followed by no significant influence of SRI as expected by dialectical movements of theory development.

The meta-regression results in Tables 6 and 7 further reinforce this interpretation on research trends in SRI area. The negative coefficients for the publication year variable suggest that researchers have come to obtain smaller AESs over time.

Another interesting result regarding the time dimension is shown in Table 8. During an economic crisis, investment performance is lower than it is in a normal period. SRI is not an exception in this regard. The negative coefficients of the Crisis variable indicate that papers whose sample periods include an economic crisis tend to have smaller ESs, which is consistent with Hypothesis 2-2.

# 5.2.2. Publication status.

We run a random-effect meta-regression with AES as the dependent variable and dummies for publication status and statistical significance as independent variables to (Table 7), where tau23. indicates the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimate test Hypothesis Univariate (Multivariate) results are shown in Table 6 of between-study variance and I2res is a percentage of residual variation due to heterogeneity. Since more than 85% of residual variance is caused by heterogeneity, running a random-effect meta-regression is well justified.

Contrary to the prediction of Hypothesis 3, the sign for the publication dummy is negative and statistically significant. When combined with the statistical significance dummy, the cross-multiplication term has a negative sign, as shown in model (5) of Table 7. It suggests that among statistically significant comparisons,

Published papers have a smaller impact on AESs. This is again inconsistent with the argument of publication bias.

In addition, we perform a test for publication bias using the Egger test of Stata 14.0 and report the result in Table 9. Since the intercept is not significantly different from zero, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no publication bias. Therefore, we can conclude that publication bias is not a serious concern for our paper.

The negative coefficient for the publication variable may indicate the quality of papers. Since authors have to go through a rigorous reviewing process to publish their papers in good journals, overly affirmative or overly negative results will be toned down. Thus, if the reviewing process is more rigorous, the AES will become smaller. To examine this idea, we introduce a new variable, Quality, which captures the quality of papers. It is equal to one for journals above median ranking in the same discipline classified by Journal Citation Reports of Clarivate Analytics, and zero for journals below median ranking. As can be seen in Tables 6 and 7, the coefficients of the Quality variable are negative, indicating that papers published in better quality journals tend to have smaller AESs.

# 5.2.3. Author type.

Academic researchers and industry professionals are different in many respects, including incentives for research (Vaihekoski, 2004). In academic circles, the efficient market hypothesis is widely accepted, but industry professionals are more concerned with finding superior abnormal return opportunities than providing evidence that supports the efficient market hypothesis. This difference will have a dampening effect on AESs for academic researchers. Consistent with this argument, Tables 6 and 7 show that academic researchers tend to find significantly smaller AESs than industry professionals, supporting Hypothesis 4-1. When combined with the statistical significance dummy in model (7) of Table 7, the cross-multiplication term of the two variables shows a significantly negative sign. It implies that among significant results, researchers in academia tend to find lower AESs than industry professionals, which is again consistent with Hypothesis 4-1.

It is possible that researchers in different disciplines may place a different priority on social and economic values. Researchers in the finance area may put a higher priority on profit maximization than social aspects, producing results showing a.

# 5.2.4. Control group.

In general, SRI funds characteristics are not the same as those of the market index, which includes not only SRI funds stocks but also stocks of all other conventional funds. In addition, since SRI cannot have unconstrained access to whole investment opportunities, SRI portfolios are different from well-diversified market portfolios. Owing to this difference, Hypothesis 5-1 predicts that papers comparing SRI portfolios with the market index will produce larger AESs than papers comparing SRI and conventional portfolios composed by author(s) according to their research objectives. Consistent with this hypothesis, the dummy variable for market index as a control group shows a signiﬁcantly positive sign in Tables 6 and 7. This argument is further reinforced by the negative sign of the SRI_CI variable, which is consistent with Hypothesis 5-2. Since the difference is lower when comparing two indexes than when comparing SRI portfolios with the index, the former tends to have smaller AESs.

On the other hand, Table 8 shows meta-regression results on the influence of sampling moderators upon ESs themselves. Consistent with Hypothesis 5-3, the dummy variable for using the market index as a control group shows a signiﬁcantly negative sign. It implies that the relative loss of diversification is larger when SRI portfolios are compared with the market index rather than other control portfolios. The negative sign is also consistent with Luther and Matatko (1994) who obtain mostly negative excess returns of SRI portfolios when they use the market index as benchmark.

# 5.2.5. Investment universe.

In Table 8, the dummy variable for the domestic market shows a positively significant coefficient, which is consistent with Hypothesis 6. Since the cultural aspect is an important determinant of ESs, the effect of SRI will be stronger when the investment universe is domestic rather than international. Markets with a homogeneous cultural background will be affected more strongly by SRI, since fund managers will adopt investment strategies that incorporate values appreciated in their culture (Louche and Lydenberg, 2006).

# 5.2.6. Screening procedure.

Table 8 shows that SRI funds using a positive screening procedure outperform funds with a negative screening, as postulated by Hypothesis 7. This result is consistent with Humphrey and Lee (2011) who find that a positive screening significantly reduces funds’ risk, but a negative screening increases risk since it impairs the ability of funds to form diversified portfolios. More directly, Goldreyer and Diltz (1999) and Statman and Glushkov (2009) show that a positive screening has a

# Meta-analysis on SRI

Positive impact on portfolio performance, but a negative screening has a negative impact.

# 5.2.7. Mutual funds.

Performance of mutual funds is subject to various factors such as transaction costs, fees and expenditures, and managerial compensation that are largely ignored in analyses on portfolios composed by researchers. In addition, it is well known that managed mutual funds do not perform better than the market as a whole (Jensen, 1968; Carhart, 1997). Therefore, ESs on SRI mutual funds will be smaller than ESs on SRI portfolios formed by researchers. A significantly negative sign for the coefficient of mutual fund moderator in Table 8 is supportive of these arguments and is consistent with Hypothesis 8.

# 5.3. Results on Methodological Issues

In this section, we report the impact that empirical methodologies used by author(s) may have on the AES. Table 10 (Table 11) contains the results of univariate (multivariate) regressions.

# 5.3.1. Variable adjustments.

To begin with, the coefficient of the risk adjustment dummy is statistically significant with a negative sign. This is consistent with Hypothesis 9-1, indicating that the AESs calculated from risk-adjusted performance measures are systematically smaller than those calculated from raw returns. Table 12 reports the risk-adjusted performance measures used in the sample. The majority of papers use Jensen’s alpha, and only a small number of papers use the Sharpe ratio or the Treynor index (M’Zali and Turcotte, 1998). Other measures are mostly based on accounting data such as return on assets and the average ES is very large (Cohen et al., 1997). Basically, stock returns are forward looking, but accounting data are not, and it is not uncommon to have conflicting results in finance research. Moreover, the small sample size of other measures makes it difficult to draw any serious inference.

Since SRI funds have a different exposure from conventional funds to small firms, equally weighted portfolio returns can generate undeserved performance differences between the two, unlike value-weighted returns. In Tables 10 and 11, the coefficient of weighting scheme has a negative sign and is statistically significant, indicating that the value weighting scheme tends to have smaller AESs, as predicted by Hypothesis 9-2.

Hypothesis 9-3 suggests that using more accurate data can reduce the possibility of obtaining a spurious difference between SRI and conventional investments. For example, if SRI funds invest more in small firms than conventional funds, ignoring dividends may produce unwarranted differences in SRI and conventional portfolio performance. Therefore, papers improving data accuracy by considering dividends and stock splits when calculating returns will have smaller AESs. The significantly negative sign of data accuracy variable in model (2) of Table 11 is consistent with Hypothesis 9-3 although other regressions do not show statistical significance.

# 5.3.2. Refining benchmark model.

Some authors use a single-index model as a return-generating process to compute excess returns (Hamilton et al., 1993; Reyes and Grieb, 1998; Goldreyer and Diltz, 1999; Statman, 2000; Bello, 2005), while others use multi-factor models (Luther et al., 1992; Luther and Matatko, 1994; Gregory et al., 1997). The negative sign on the Index variable in Tables 10 and 11 suggests that the AESs calculated using multi-factor models are smaller than those calculated using a single-index model, consistent with Hypothesis 10. Since multi-index models control for more dimensions of corporate characteristics than single-index models, a spurious difference in performances between SRI and conventional portfolios tends to be smaller than in the case of using a single-index model.

In practice, fund managers change their portfolio holdings if macroeconomic conditions change, resulting in dynamic risk–return profiles. In this case, conditional models are more appropriate for handling dynamic return-generating.

# 5.3.3. Matching.

Matching procedures will eliminate the spurious difference between SRI and conventional performance caused by confounding factors and induce AESs to be smaller. Consistent with this argument postulated in Hypothesis 11, Tables 10 and 11 show that the coefficient of matching dummy has a significantly negative sign. In addition, the negative sign of the Match_N variable suggests that possible bias caused by the peculiarity of a matching firm in one-to-one matching can be minimized by matching multiple counterparts, leading to a reduction in unwarranted differences between SRI and conventional portfolios.

# 6. Conclusions and Discussions

This article investigated the impact of SRI on investment performance in the US, using a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis makes a comparison across diverse studies possible by computing ES that is a standardized measure of impact derived from treatment and control groups.

The empirical results show that the weighted average ES is not different from zero. It is an important finding for investors since they do not have to be concerned with the possibility of sacrificing returns when they pursue investment strategies that are socially responsible.

We establish various moderators and run meta-regressions in order to examine whether ESs and AESs change systematically depending on research characteristics. For this, we split moderators into two groups, one related to sampling issues and the other related to methodological issues. To begin with, we find that ESs are positive in the earlier period and have become smaller in terms of absolute value with alternating signs as time passes. When the idea of SRI was relatively new, investors seemed to be able to earn excess returns by incorporating SRI elements in their portfolio. However, the excess return opportunity may have decreased over time and researchers seem to find a smaller impact of SRI since spurious differences between SRI and conventional investment performances are eliminated by the improvement in sampling and methodology and this pattern is by and large consistent with a dialectical development of theories. We also find that papers with sample periods containing economic crisis tend to show a lower ES, as expected.

As for publication status, we find no evidence of publication bias, so we can interpret our results without this complication caused by the publication status of papers. An interesting finding is that better quality journals show relatively smaller AESs than lower quality journals, suggesting that rigorous review processes make papers tone down unwarranted excessive claims.

# Meta-analysis on SRI

Whereas the efficient market hypothesis is widely accepted in academia, researchers from industry are more interested in developing a logical backup for industry practices such as active portfolio management and finding the profit potential in SRI. Owing to this difference in research incentives and environment, academic researchers tend to uncover smaller AESs than industry professionals. However, there is no systematic difference in SRI performance among scholars in different disciplines.

Obviously, the chance of having spurious performance difference between SRI and conventional funds becomes higher as the two groups are more different. Consistent with this conjecture, we find that the AESs are bigger when SRI samples are compared with market indexes than when SRI samples are compared with conventional portfolios. And, the AESs are smaller when SRI indexes, not SRI portfolios, are compared with conventional indexes.

Studies comparing SRI portfolios with market portfolios rather than other conventional portfolios tend to show lower ESs. In addition, studies examining negative screening tend to generate smaller ESs than those with positive screening. SRI portfolios and negative screening portfolios seem to sacrifice a diversification benefit, compared with market portfolio and positive screening portfolios, respectively.

Cultural background seems to be an important factor, since domestic SRI funds tend to show higher ESs than international funds. Finally, studies of mutual fund samples show smaller ESs than those of author-composed portfolios. This is largely consistent with capital market efficiency and evidence on mutual fund performances that managed funds rarely beat the market. This result is also related to the fact that mutual fund performance incorporates all costs such as fees, transaction costs, and management compensation, whereas a comparison of composed portfolios in general does not fully take this aspect into account.

We investigate three methodological issues: variable adjustment, the refining benchmark model, and matching procedure. Regarding variable adjustment, our results indicate that any spurious difference in performance between SRI and conventional portfolios can be reduced by using risk-adjusted performance measures, value-weighting schemes, and more accurate variables. Refining benchmark models is related to the issue of return-generating models. Papers using multi-factor models seem to report a lower SRI impact than those using a single-index model. As for matching procedure, papers employing a matching strategy between SRI and control portfolios tend to show smaller AESs. These results suggest that researchers must try to secure similarities as much as possible to minimize a spurious performance difference between SRI and control portfolios. Researchers also have to avoid making various methodological errors.

There is a limitation to drawing a universal conclusion on the impact of SRI upon investment performance, since our empirical result is based only on the US market. However, the findings in this article can be a valid starting point for future research. A natural candidate for future research is an inter-country or inter-

regional comparison of SRI performances. Although data collection and reﬁnement and the interpretation of results based on different cultural backgrounds would be quite challenging, such a study will deﬁnitely enhance our understanding of this important issue.

As for methodology, it is true that meta-analysis is a good tool to summarize many papers on the same subject. However, a wide variety of differences among selected papers in terms of sampling and methodology is a signiﬁcant challenge when performing a sound meta-analysis. Theoretically, the SRI performance can be different depending on the research period, crisis versus normal times, security types, portfolio diversiﬁcation, social and cultural backgrounds, domestic versus international investments, and so forth. However, even though there would be only one true level of performance difference between SRI and control portfolios caused by a particular factor, researchers may ﬁnd a dissimilar performance difference if they use different research methodologies. Therefore, future research should be able to separate out more clearly a true SRI impact and the variation in observed SRI performance caused by differences in the research methodologies employed.

Corporate sustainability confronts managers with tensions between complex economic, environmental, and social issues. Drawing on the literature on managerial cognition, corporate sustainability, and strategic paradoxes, we develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We propose two cognitive frames—a business case frame and a paradoxical frame—and explore how differences between them in cognitive content and structure influence the three stages of the sensemaking process—that is, managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues. We explain how the two frames lead to differences in the breadth and depth of scanning, differences in issue interpretations in terms of sense of control and issue valence, and different types of responses that managers consider with regard to sustainability issues. By considering alternative cognitive frames, our argument contributes to a better understanding of managerial decision making regarding ambiguous sustainability issues, and it develops the underlying cognitive determinants of the stance that managers adopt on sustainability issues. This argument offers a cognitive explanation for why managers rarely push for radical change when faced with complex and ambiguous issues, such as sustainability, that are characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects.

Corporate sustainability requires managers to simultaneously address widely diverging but interconnected concerns for the natural environment, social welfare, and economic prosperity (Bansal, 2002; Gladwin, Kennelly, & Krause, 1995; Maon, Lindgreen, & Swaen, 2008). As a consequence, corporate decision makers “face a great deal of ambiguity in understanding the issues, the implications of these issues for their organizations, and ways to respond to these issues” (Sharma, 2000: 683). The question of how managers make sense of such ambiguous cues from their organizational context has increasingly been addressed from a cognitive perspective (for overviews see Hodgkinson & Healey, 2008; Porac & Thomas, 2002; Walsh, 1995). Through cognitive frames, which act as “cognitive filters that admit certain bits of information into the strategizing process while excluding others” (Porac & Thomas, 2002: 178), managers imbue ambiguous cues with meaning, which leads them to consider specific strategic responses (Weick, 1995).

Several authors have applied a cognitive lens to the analysis of corporate sustainability and related concepts, such as corporate social responsibility or corporate citizenship (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Maon et al., 2008; Sharma, 2000; Sharma, Pablo, & Vredenburg, 1999).

detailed analysis of the effects that cognitive frames with different content and structure have on managers’ sensemaking of the ambiguities around sustainability is still lacking (Angus-Leppan, Benn, & Young, 2010; Byrch, Kearins, Milne, & Morgan, 2007; Zietsma & Vertinsky, 1999). In particular, the strong focus on business case thinking (Carroll & Shabana, 2010) that permeates research on corporate sustainability (Bansal, 2005; Gao & Bansal, 2013; Hahn, Figge, Pinkse, & Preuss, 2010) has resulted in a situation where managerial responses to sustainability issues are conceptualized along an opportunity/threat dichotomy (Andersson Bateman, 2000; Sharma, 2000) dominated by economic objectives of the firm. In contrast, our aim is to generate a better understanding of the underlying cognitive determinants of different responses to sustainability issues that managers consider.

Drawing on the literature on managerial cognition, corporate sustainability, and strategic paradoxes (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005), we develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We propose two cognitive frames—a business case frame and a paradoxical frame—to explore how differences in cognitive content and structure influence the three stages of the sensemaking process—that is, scanning, interpreting, and responding (Daft & Weick, 1984; Thomas, Clark, & Gioia, 1993). The two frames are based on contrasting views of the relationship between the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability and result in different decision-making stances on sustainability issues. We propose that managers with a business case frame focus on environmental and social aspects that align with economic objectives and, thus, interpret sustainability issues univalently as either positive or negative for their business; hence, they adopt a pragmatic stance on sustainability issues, with a propensity to pursue narrow but workable responses along existing routines and solutions. In contrast, with their awareness of multiple and conflicting economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability issues, managers with a paradoxical frame develop more ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues; as a consequence, they adopt a prudent stance, where they consider more comprehensive responses, but because of their higher awareness of risk and tensions, they move forward slowly and carefully.

As our main contribution, we advance theorizing about managerial decision making by considering the effects of alternative cognitive frames on the sensemaking process of sustainability issues. Our examination of the differences in content and structure of managers’ cognitive frames offers a more sophisticated understanding of the responses to sustainability issues they consider. We offer testable propositions on the effects of the two frames on managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues. Our argument results in a cognitive explanation for why managers— owing to the predispositions and limitations inherent in both frames—rarely push for radical change in the face of the immense challenges that sustainability presents. More generally, our plea to consider a greater cognitive diversity contributes to a better understanding of how managers make sense of ambiguous issues that are characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects.

We organize the article as follows. We first develop the business case frame and the paradoxical frame with regard to their content and structure. We then develop propositions on how the two frames influence managerial sensemaking of sustainability issues, as well as on the most important factors that moderate these effects. In concluding the article we discuss key implications and offer avenues for future research.

# COGNITIVE FRAMING AND MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING

Decision makers operate in turbulent organizational contexts with complex and ambiguous signals. According to cognitive categorization theory, individuals use cognitive heuristics to make sense of such complex situations (Mervis & Rosch, 1981; Rosch, 1975). As complexity increases, sensemaking shifts from being perception based to being category based, since people’s “cognitive processing becomes schema-driven . . . and they . . . assign a handful of their direct perceptions to types, categories, stereotypes, and schemas” (Weick, 2010: 541). Correspondingly, research on managerial cognition suggests that managers interpret and make sense of ambiguous and complex signals.

through cognitive frames (for overviews see Hodgkinson & Healey, 2008; Porac & Thomas, 2002; Walsh, 1995). A cognitive frame is a “mental template that individuals impose on an information environment to give it form and meaning” (Walsh, 1995: 281). These frames are produced and reproduced by individuals through labeling objects and situations according to observed attributes.

Because human rationality is bounded, managers do not achieve a complete understanding of strategic situations; rather, they use cognitive frames to “develop subjective representations of the environment that, in turn, drive their strategic decisions and subsequent firm action” (Nadkarni & Barr, 2008: 1395). Through cognitive frames managers reduce complexity and ambiguity by selectively organizing and interpreting signals from the organizational context (Dutton & Jackson, 1987). At the same time, cognitive framing occurs “on the basis of past learning and categorization” (Mervis & Rosch, 1981: 89) and, thus, is self-referring and retrospective, which results in a confirmatory bias that directs attention toward signals that fit existing frames and away from signals that are inconsistent with these frames (Palich & Bagby, 1995). Hence, cognitive framing can also limit decision makers’ understanding of a situation since it “may encourage stereotypic thinking; subvert controlled information processing; fill data gaps with typical but perhaps inaccurate information; prompt one to ignore discrepant and possibly important information; discourage disconfirmation of the existing knowledge structure; and inhibit creative problem solving” (Walsh, 1995: 282).

Following Walsh (1995), we distinguish between the content and the structure of a cognitive frame. Cognitive content “consists of the things he or she knows, assumes and believes,” while cognitive structure denotes “how the content is arranged, connected or studied in the executive’s mind” (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996: 57). The content of a cognitive frame relates to a particular domain, such as corporate strategy making (Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994) or entrepreneurship (Shepherd, 1999). Within a domain, frame content captures a person’s ascription of attributes to objects and events, where an “attribute is any basis a person uses to distinguish or group objects and events” (Scott, Osgood, & Peterson, 1979: 36). Attributes that serve to differentiate objects and events into categories are said to have high cue validity (Dutton & Jackson, 1987). With regard to the structure of a cognitive frame, Bartunek, Gordon, and Weathersby suggested that the two primary dimensions are “differentiation—the ability to perceive several dimensions in a stimulus array—and integration—the development of complex connections among the differentiated characteristics” (1983: 274). Differentiation captures the number of elements within a frame, and integration describes the degree of interconnectedness among these elements (Walsh, 1995). Taken together, structure and content of a particular cognitive frame lead to a particular interpretation of a situation and, in turn, to a particular managerial response (Tikkanen, Lamberg, Parvinen, & Kallunki, 2005).

# COGNITIVE FRAMING IN MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING ON SUSTAINABILITY

Corporate sustainability “refers to a company’s activities . . . demonstrating the inclusion of social and environmental concerns in business operations and in interactions with stakeholders” (van Marrewijk & Werre, 2003: 107). Corporate sustainability deals with a multitude of demands and objectives at organizational and societal levels that appear desirable in isolation but are “inextricably connected and internally interdependent” (Bansal, 2002: 123). It therefore produces a decision-making context with highly ambiguous signals, where decision making strongly depends on the frame managers use (Bogner & Barr, 2000; Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994; Kaplan, 2008). First, from the perspective of sustainability, firms need to address economic as well as environmental and social outcomes, which have to be achieved simultaneously (Elkington, 1997; Gao & Bansal, 2013). This need to address various desirable but interdependent outcomes simultaneously leads to a risk of unintended consequences, since a solution to one issue could be detrimental to that of another (Newton, 2002). Second, sustainability suggests that “business firms are expected to improve the general welfare of society” (Schwartz & Carroll, 2008: 168). This reference to multidimensional outcomes at the societal level complicates the objective function of the firm (Jensen, 2001), because it comes in addition to financial performance goals at the organizational level. Because of a strong focus on intergenerational

fairness (WCED, 1987), sustainability also “emphasizes the long-term nature of the benefit that business is expected to provide to society” (Schwartz & Carroll, 2008: 163), as opposed to the oftentimes short-term focus of managerial decision making (Held, 2001; Slawinski & Bansal, 2012). Third, sustainability involves the simultaneous recognition of various and often conflicting demands of a wider set of stakeholders (Clarkson, 1995; Maon et al., 2008), who apply decision logics that are different from those of managers and shareholders (Hahn, in press).

Overall, sustainability confronts managers with situations in which they need to simultaneously address multiple desirable but conflicting economic, environmental, and social outcomes at firm and societal levels that operate in different time frames and follow different logics. At the same time, firms and managers are being criticized for their reluctance to adopt radical responses to address sustainability concerns (Whiteman, Walker, & Perego, 2013). To gain greater insights into corporate sustainability decision making, it is therefore critical to understand which cognitive frames managers use to cognitively process these ambiguities (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Maon et al., 2008; Sharma, 2000; Sharma et al., 1999).

# Business Case Frame and Paradoxical Frame

Many of the ambiguities that surround sustainability stem from the interrelated yet conflicting nature of economic, environmental, and social outcomes (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). We develop two cognitive frames that reflect decision makers’ assumptions regarding the relationship of these aspects of sustainability on the basis of work by Smith and colleagues (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005), who suggest two approaches for managers to deal with ambiguities. The first approach is based on an alignment logic and reflects the “belief in a unitary truth [which] means inconsistencies cannot fundamentally coexist” (Smith & Tushman, 2005: 525). It holds that managers deal with ambiguities by trying to eliminate tensions—that is, they seek situations with a fit between various factors and look for contingencies that reconcile any inconsistencies (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Such a need to eliminate tensions resonates with the business case for corporate sustainability, which argues for an alignment of social and environmental outcomes with financial performance (Carroll & Shabana, 2010; Salzmann, Ionescu-Somers, & Steger, 2005). We therefore label the first cognitive frame the business case frame.

The second approach of Smith and colleagues stipulates that in complex organizational contexts tensions and inconsistencies are highly salient and cannot be eliminated (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). It emphasizes that by using paradoxical thinking managers accept tensions and accommodate conflicting yet interrelated economic, environmental, and social concerns, rather than eliminate them (Gao & Bansal, 2013; Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Accordingly, we label the second cognitive frame the paradoxical frame (Miron-Spektor, Gino, & Argote, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the two frames.

The two frames represent ideal types (Doty & Glick, 1994) in the sense of accentuated abstractions of how managers conceive of the relationship between and among the economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability. Representing the end points of a continuum, the two ideal-type frames conceptualize this relationship by either aligning environmental and social aspects with the economic dimension (business case frame) or by accepting and accommodating the interrelated yet contradictory nature of all three aspects (paradoxical frame). Since ideal types rarely exist in pure form, the actual frames of decision makers will lie between the end points and resemble the ideal types to different degrees (Doty & Glick, 1994). Actual frames thus consist of different combinations of the underlying constructs—that is, frame content and structure—of the two ideal-type frames.

Content. The content of the two frames is defined by the attributes decision makers use when they make sense of ambiguous cues and differs with regard to the dominance and diversity of these attributes. As developed above, the business case frame follows an alignment logic, which puts economic attributes first.1 Social and

1 Alignment can be based on different rationales, depending on which kinds of attributes dominate the content of a cognitive frame. Conceptually speaking, an ecological case frame or a social case frame, where environmental or social attributes dominate, respectively, would also follow an

# Characteristics of the Business Case Frame and the Paradoxical Frame

|Frame Characteristics|Business Case Frame|Paradoxical Frame|
|---|---|---|
|Content|Exclusive focus on business attributes|Combination of multiple attributes with different rationales|
|Structure|Simple|Complex|
|Differentiation|Low number of frame elements|High number of frame elements|
|Integration|Low degree of connectedness with singular focus on economic means-ends relationships|High degree of connectedness with a plurality of reinforcing, neutral, and conflicting relationships|
|Implicit goal|Improve economic performance at the organizational level|Address economic, environmental, and social concerns at organizational and societal levels|
|Underlying logic|Business case thinking: Alignment of environmental and social concerns with economic objectives|Paradoxical thinking: Juxtaposition of economic, environmental, and social concerns, even if contradictory|
|Treatment of tensions|Elimination|Acceptance|

Environmental aspects are only taken into account when they can be aligned with financial contradictions (Smith & Tushman, 2005: 533)—to accommodate competing yet interrelated economic, environmental, and social concerns that reside at different levels and operate in different logics and time frames (Byrch et al., 2007; Gao & Bansal, 2013). However, since the paradoxical frame does not systematically emphasize one sustainability dimension over any other, it does not offer unequivocal guidance on which aspect of a sustainability issue to prioritize.

Structure. The differences in content and underlying logic between the two frames also influence the frames’ structure, both with regard to the number of salient frame elements (i.e., the degree of differentiation) and the complexity and multitude of connections between these elements (i.e., the degree of integration). For the business case frame, the strong focus on economic attributes results in comparatively low degrees of differentiation and integration. Differentiation is low because the economic focus limits the number of attributes represented. Integration is also low because, owing to its emphasis on aligning environmental and social concerns with financial performance, this frame only considers connections between frame elements that are based on hierarchical means-ends relationships. Other, more complex relations, where social and environmental aspects do not align with financial performance, are not taken into account. However, the consideration of only a limited set of connections does allow managers with a business case frame to eliminate inconsistencies and tensions (Smith & Tushman, 2005).

Lewis, 2011; Weick, 1995) and to reduce com- complexity and ambiguity of the issue (Levinthal & Rerup, 2006; Porac & Rosa, 1996). A paradoxical frame has a more complex structure. The inclusiveness of this frame results in a higher degree of differentiation since it accommodates frame elements covering all three sustainability dimensions. While the high degree of differentiation refers to the inclusion of a wide variety of attributes, this frame also has a higher degree of integration since it takes into account different reinforcing, neutral, and conflicting connections between and among sustainability dimensions.

# Relationship Between the Two Frames

As noted above, the business case frame and the paradoxical frame represent two ideal-type conceptualizations of how managers relate economic, environmental, and social concerns to each other. They represent the end points of a continuum, with a full alignment with economic objectives at the one end and a combination of interrelated yet conflicting economic, environmental, and social concerns at the other end. Although as ideal types the business case frame and the paradoxical frame are distinct, actual frames represent different combinations of content and structure of the two ideal types (see Figure 1). Starting with the business case frame at the one extreme, once a frame starts to include salient environmental and social attributes, in addition to economic attributes, its content gets more diverse and its structure more differentiated (upward move in Figure 1). With the number of frame elements increasing, the number of possible connections between elements grows disproportionately. The higher the number and the greater the diversity of frame elements, the more complex and diverse the interconnections. Hence, the cognitive frame has a higher degree of integration, which will eventually result in the paradoxical frame at the other extreme (rightward move in Figure 1). The more a frame is rooted in an alignment logic (business case frame), the greater its focus but the lower its complexity. In contrast, the more a frame uses paradoxical thinking (paradoxical frame), the higher its complexity but the lower its focus.

We propose that these two ideal-type frames are useful heuristic devices to understand managerial decision making in a sustainability context. We now develop the consequences of each frame for the process of managerial sensemaking of sustainability issues. Exploring the consequences of the two cognitive frames provides a more comprehensive understanding of managerial cognition on ambiguities around sustainability (Walsh, 1995).

# SENSEMAKING OF CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY WITH THE BUSINESS CASE FRAME AND THE PARADOXICAL FRAME

Sensemaking occurs as a sequence of three core processes: scanning, interpreting, and responding (Daft & Weick, 1984; Thomas et al., 1993). Below we develop the differences in terms of managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues depending on whether decision makers hold a business case frame or a paradoxical frame. In the scanning phase decision makers reduce the amount and complexity of information, and, depending on the frame they hold, notice different aspects of a situation, in turn leading to differences in their information processing and interpretation of the situation. In the interpretation phase any given situation may be understood as relevant by some but perceived as irrelevant or completely overlooked by others (Barr & Huff, 1997). Assigning more or less relevance and specific meaning to the information then has consequences for the managers’ strategic response.

# Scanning

“Scanning involves information gathering; it usually is considered an antecedent to interpretation and action” (Thomas et al., 1993: 240). Because of their cognitive limitations, decision makers are exposed to more information than they can process (Mintzberg, 1973); hence, “executives can perceive only a selected portion of the environment” (Das & Teng, 1999: 764). Decision makers scan information according to the relevance they assign to it based on their cognitive frames (Hambrick, 1982; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Owing to the confirmatory bias of cognitive framing, they selectively notice information that conforms to their cognitive frames and ignore information that contradicts these frames (Nickerson, 1998; Palich & Bagby, 1995). They also fill gaps with frame-consistent information and tend to miss extreme or highly surprising information because it escapes their cognitive categories (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982).

Important aspects of scanning refer to the depth and breadth of the information that managers collect (Beyer et al., 1997; Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997; Walsh, 1988) on sustainability issues (Mazutis, 2013). Information collection operates on a continuum between, at one extreme, focused search, where decision makers are looking for specific information with a clear purpose in mind, and, at the other extreme, general browsing through information, “without a particular problem to solve or question to answer” (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997: 83). Regarding the breadth of perceived aspects, Beyer and colleagues found that “the more restricted the observational goals of decision makers, the more selective their perceptions will be” (1997: 720). Similarly, the more managers attend to selected targets and previously formed hypotheses about the relationship between different aspects, the more “they might overlook information and evidence that may prove the opposite” (Das & Teng, 1999: 762). That is, a priori objectives and hypotheses selectively highlight particular cues from the organizational context (Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988).

The business case frame, with its content built on economic attributes and its structure based on an alignment logic, provides managers with strong direction but, at the same time, restricts observational goals. We thus expect managers with a business case frame to perceive a rather narrow portion of the information on a sustainability issue. They will more easily absorb information they perceive as having business relevance and that is structured similar to other business information, which is very often expressed in quantitative terms (Daft & Weick, 1984). For instance, the publication of the “Stern Review” attracted managerial attention because it presented monetary estimates of the economic damage caused by climate change. Crucially, the report presented climate change as a business opportunity, stressing the benefits of early action as a way to prevent the costs of remaining inactive (Stern, 2006).

Decision makers with cognitive frames of low complexity also tend to collect information from fewer selected sources (Karlins, 1967; Stabell, 1978). Accordingly, managers with a business case frame will limit their attention to sustainability-related claims of stakeholders closely related to the market environment, since these will be perceived as more powerful and relevant for business (Mitchell, Agle, & Wood, 1997). People tend to stereotype information depending on its source (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982), so decision makers with a business case frame will attend less to environmental and social issues brought forward by stakeholders having no direct im-

pact on their business. For instance, in the 1970s General Motors’ upper management did not consider many suggestions for smaller, less polluting cars because they were brought forward by groups outside the scope of the executives’ focus (Wright, 1979). Consequently, managers with a business case frame will not take full notice of the multitude of sustainability issues and claims that arise in their organizational contexts. The more the frames of decision makers focus on economic attributes and an alignment logic, the more decision makers tend to perceive issues only once these have progressed to later stages of the issue life cycle—that is, when actors with direct business relevance, such as regulators or competitors, have adopted the issue (Mahon & Waddock, 1992; Wartick & Mahon, 1994).

While the business case frame limits the breadth of managerial scanning, it enables managers to approach decision situations with known objectives (Das & Teng, 1999). Following an alignment logic, managers probe the environmental and social aspects they notice for potential economic benefits. With this narrow focus the business case frame provides clear direction and reduces uncertainties regarding which aspects managers should look for (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). The clear focus on the business relevance of sustainability issues allows managers to employ highly formalized and clearly structured search routines to collect detailed information (Das & Teng, 1999). Consequently, we expect that managers with a business case frame will be more likely to collect detailed information on how selected sustainability issues contribute to financial performance. Overall, we argue that the business case frame will lead managers to notice rather few sustainability issues but to seek detailed information, based on readily available, quantitative information at advanced stages of the issue life cycle, on how selected aspects of these issues relate to financial outcomes (see Figure 2).

# Proposition 1a:

The more business case oriented their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to notice a narrow range of sustainability issues based on focused search with little breadth, but with detailed information on how these issues relate to economic objectives.

# FIGURE 2

Effects of the Business Case Frame and the Paradoxical Frame on Scanning

The paradoxical frame does not direct decision makers toward clearly defined objectives and previously formed hypotheses about one specific type of relationship between different sustainability aspects. Rather, we expect managers with this frame to have a less selective perception of sustainability issues (Beyer et al., 1997). With their more complex frame structure and frame content comprising more diverse economic, environmental, and social attributes, decision makers will scan more broadly and attend to a wider range of aspects of sustainability issues, even if they are contradictory. Moreover, as Stabell argued, decision makers with complex frames will tend “to combine the information from a wide variety of information sources as the individual is able to generate perspectives that can integrate such a diversity of information” (1997: 720). Decision makers with a paradoxical frame will thus gather more diverse information on sustainability issues—that is, information related to economic, environmental, and social aspects—irrespective of immediate financial implications (Byrch et al., 2007). Because they hold a more complex conceptualization of their business (Crilly & Sloan, 2012), they will gather quantitative and qualitative, as well as financial and nonfinancial, information. They will also take note of opinions held by a wider range of stakeholders (Daft & Lengel, 1986; Wong, Ormiston, & Tetlock, 2011) and notice signals from diffuse sources with little or no immediate relevance.

2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 471

diate business relevance, as well as from earlier stages of the issue life cycle (Halme, 2002; Wartick & Mahon, 1994). Since the structure of the paradoxical frame encompasses conflicting relations between different sustainability dimensions, decision makers will be more likely to notice redundant and inconsistent information. Their information collection will be less structured and less formalized, because increasing formalization “constrains the information that decision makers can take into account” (Heidmann, Schaffer, & Strahringer, 2008: 246). For instance, biodiversity represents an issue that is still at an early stage in its life cycle, and managers struggle with how to make sense of it (Financial Times, 2012). Since biodiversity relates to many different ecological processes, managers need to scan beyond traditional business sources to comprehend the complexity of the issue. Hence, the CEO of global cement firm Holcim initiated a partnership in 2007 with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), an environmental NGO dedicated to biodiversity, to collect independent expert opinion on the relevance of biodiversity for Holcim (Imboden, Gross, Meynell, Richards, & Stalmans, 2010).

However, the paradoxical frame does not emphasize one sustainability dimension over any other, so it does not provide an unequivocal direction for information collection. Scanning might be broad, but also rather vague, since breadth comes at the expense of detailed information search (Das & Teng, 1999). With their complex and broad frame, managers may perceive too many issues and aspects as potentially relevant (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). Owing to their limited cognitive capacities (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982), decision makers cannot collect, process, and store detailed information on a wide range of sustainability aspects, as well as on the complex interconnections between them; hence, uncertainties will remain. While decision makers can cope with tensions and uncertainties through paradoxical thinking, their scanning will remain inconclusive. Overall, we expect that the less their cognitive frame is focused on alignment, the wider the variety of aspects of numerous sustainability issues managers will notice but the less they will be able to collect detailed information on the various aspects of these issues and their interrelations (see Figure 2).

# Proposition 1b:

The more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to notice a wide range of aspects of numerous sustainability issues based on broad browsing, but with a lack of detailed information.

Since cognitive frames are acquired and learned through a manager’s career history (Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994; Porac & Thomas, 2002), we expect that the functional background of decision makers will influence their scanning of strategic issues (Beyer et al., 1997; Sutcliffe & Huber, 1998; Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997; Walsh, 1988). According to previous research, functional background influences the breadth and depth of scanning, because managers with different functional backgrounds favor different search modes (Beyer et al., 1997). Managers with a background in internally oriented functions, such as engineering, accounting, and finance, have the tendency to be more task oriented and to focus more on internal efficiency (Hambrick & Mason, 1984), as well as on unidimensional and clearly structured outcomes (Thomas & Simerly, 1994). They are thus more likely to perform focused search in a structured and formalized manner (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). Managers from externally oriented functions, such as marketing, research, and product development (Hambrick & Mason, 1984), are more often exposed to situations where stakeholder demands are in conflict (Maon et al., 2008). Hence, they tend to be “more adept at recognizing the multiple demands of their stakeholders [and the] competing interests of their constituents” (Thomas & Simerly, 1994: 962). These managers are more familiar with collecting information through broad and less structured browsing (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). We therefore expect that managers with a background in externally oriented functions will tend to scan more broadly but in less detail, while those with an internally oriented functional background will tend to scan less broadly but in more detail (as indicated by the arrows in Figure 2).

# Proposition 2a:

Decision makers with a background in externally oriented functions will scan more broadly but with less detail, which will weaken the effects of the business case frame on scanning.

# Academy of Management Review

# Proposition 2b

Decision makers with a background in internally oriented functions will scan less broadly but with more detail, which will weaken the effects of the paradoxical frame on scanning.

Managers’ perceptions of ambiguous cues from the organizational context are not only constrained by their cognitive capacities and personal characteristics but also by situational factors. When dealing with conflicting information and disparate stakeholder interests, managers usually do so under time pressure and resource limitations (Mann & Tan, 1993). Hence, scholars often argue that a greater availability of resources will enhance managers’ ability to collect more detailed and broader information on sustainability issues, since collecting and processing information on a broad range of sustainability issues is time consuming and costly (Bansal, 2005; Bowen, 2002; Sharma, 2000). Additional time and resources “can facilitate search activity which is not necessarily problem-related” (Bowen, 2002: 311) and can provide the latitude to perform searches on aspects and issues that may not have an immediate payoff (Levinthal & March, 1981). However, we argue that the effect of resource availability on managerial scanning of sustainability issues will not be categorical. The breadth of scanning by managers with a business case frame is not primarily limited by a lack of time or resources but, rather, by the focus of the frame content on economic attributes and by its alignment structure. Even with abundant resources, these managers are not likely to perform a broader search. They will still fail to notice information on sustainability issues that is presented in nonfinancial, qualitative terms and that has an ambiguous relation to financial outcomes. Conversely, the information search of managers with a paradoxical frame is limited by their capacity to collect and process detailed information on a broad range of sustainability issues. Part of this limitation will be due to their limited cognitive capacities to handle large amounts of information (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). However, the availability of additional time and resources will allow these managers to collect more detailed information on the broad range of sustainability issues they have noticed. We therefore suggest the following relation between resource availability and scanning (see the dotted curve in Figure 2).

# Proposition 3

The availability of additional time and resources will enable decision makers with a paradoxical frame to scan in more detail but will not increase the breadth of scanning of decision makers with a business case frame.

# Interpreting

“Interpretation is the act of carving out meaning from ambiguous cues and is the very core of the sensemaking process” (Porac & Thomas, 2002: 178). As research on strategic issue diagnosis suggests (Dutton & Duncan, 1987; Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Thomas et al., 1993), managers interpret strategic issues by assessing different aspects of those issues against the categories of their cognitive frames. Individuals with different cognitive frames will attach different labels to information in order to understand it and will interpret information differently (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005). Accordingly, we expect that decision makers with a business case frame will interpret the ambiguities of sustainability issues differently from decision makers with a paradoxical frame.

Managers commonly interpret strategic issues in terms of two dimensions: sense of control over the issue and valence of the issue—that is, their evaluation of the issue as positive or negative (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Plambeck & Weber, 2010). The perceived sense of control reflects the extent to which a manager believes “in his or her ability to effect a change, in a desired direction” (Greenberger & Strasser, 1986: 165). Sense of control is neither a stable personality trait, since it can change over time and differ according to the issue or situation at hand, nor is it objective (Greenberger & Strasser, 1986). Rather, it represents a subjective perception and may even be an illusion (Langer, 1975). With regard to the valence of an issue, in previous work on strategic issue diagnosis, researchers tended to assume that decision makers usually classify an issue as either positive or negative (Chattopadhyay, Glick, & Huber, 2001; Dutton & Jackson, 1987; George, Chattopadhyay, Sitkin, & Barden, 2006; Jackson & Dutton, 1988; Sharma, 2000; Thomas et al., 1993). More recently, how-

2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 473

ever, organizational scholars have devoted attention to ambivalent interpretations of strategic issues (Fong, 2006; Gilbert, 2006; Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010). While univalent interpretations denote an issue as being clearly positive or negative, ambivalent interpretations attach competing positive and negative evaluations to various aspects of an issue (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010).

We argue that managers’ cognitive frames will play an important role in their perceived sense of control and valence of sustainability issues. Their perceived sense of control depends on what information is available to them (Thomas et al., 1993) and how that information is collected (Das & Teng, 1999). “High levels of information use among top managers will be positively related to their interpretation of strategic issues as controllable” (Thomas et al., 1993: 243). Moreover, the more managers believe they understand cause-and-effect relationships between different aspects of an issue, the higher their sense of control will be (Sharma et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 1993). With their frame content focused on economic attributes and frame structure based on an alignment logic, managers with a business case frame will have the clear goal of identifying and gaining a detailed understanding of sustainability issues that contribute to economic objectives. Consequently, we expect managers with a business case frame to perceive a high sense of control over the few sustainability issues they have noticed.

The sense of control will be heightened by their highly structured and formalized search and assessment routines, which have a clear problem focus (Das & Teng, 1999). Since they will systematically probe into how sustainability issues relate to financial performance, they will tend to be confident about their ability to understand the nature of this cause-and-effect relationship. As an example, Royal Dutch/Shell managers defended their plans for oil drilling in the Arctic against criticism from environmental NGOs and competitors by highlighting their positive evaluation in terms of business opportunities and their ability to control potential spills. Through a spokesperson, Shell’s top managers argued that “at Shell, we believe the Arctic has significant untapped potential and will play an increasingly important role in meeting the energy challenge” and emphasized their sense of control by stating that “our experience working in rigorous and challenging conditions in the Arctic means that we are qualified to do the job right—to explore for offshore oil and gas in Alaska in a very safe and careful way” (The Guardian, 2012: 35).

Based on “a feeling that no stone has been left unturned” (Thomas et al., 1993: 243), they will have a high sense of mastery and control over sustainability issues.

Decision makers assess issue valence by evaluating those aspects of an issue they have noticed against the categories of their cognitive frame (Petty, Brinol, & DeMarree, 2007). Rudolph and Popp (2007) found that individuals with strong directional goals tend to interpret issues univalently—that is, as either clearly positive or clearly negative. Because of the strong direction, decision makers with a paradoxical frame will no-

Decision makers notice a wide range of aspects of a sustainability issue. This broad and inclusive approach will increase their sense of control over sustainability issues, since they believe they will not have missed any important dimension of the problem (Das & Teng, 1999). On the other hand, because of the more complex structure of their frame, decision makers will accept that there are tensions and conflicts between different economic, environmental, and social aspects that can never be fully resolved (Hahn, Pinkse, Preuss, & Figge, in press; Smith & Lewis, 2011). This heightened awareness of conflict will lower their sense of control over the issue (Das & Teng, 1999). Overall, then, we expect decision makers with a paradoxical frame to perceive a moderate sense of control over sustainability issues.

The greater diversity of the paradoxical frame also affects the valence of the evaluation of sustainability issues. “Ambivalent evaluations are likely to arise when executives examine more diverse aspects of an issue, which itself is in part driven by the [cognitive] frameworks employed in the process” (Plambeck & Weber, 2010: 692). Research in environmental psychology (Castro, Garrido, Reis, & Menezes, 2009; Costarelli & Colloca, 2004) shows that the multidimensionality of sustainability issues spurs ambivalent issue interpretations. For instance, domestic waste recycling has been found to simultaneously induce both positive evaluations—satisfaction about showing ecological behavior—and negative evaluations—doubts about the overall effect of personal efforts when others do not recycle as well (Castro et al., 2009). With a very low sense of control, decision makers will perceive issues to be beyond their own influence, which will lead them to disengage from the issue and fall back on simpler univalent assessments. With a very high sense of control, decision makers will also evaluate issues univalently because they are overly confident that they can master an issue with existing resources.

routines and fail to consider alternatives (Miller, 1993). Overall, we expect managers with a paradoxical frame, and the resulting moderate sense of control, to experience enough control to handle diverse and competing aspects of an issue, but not enough control to rely excessively on routine evaluations. As a result, such managers will more likely apply distinct and competing positive and negative evaluations simultaneously (see Figure 3).

# Proposition 4b:

The more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to perceive a moderate sense of control over a wide range of sustainability issues and to interpret these issues ambivalently.

Since managerial sensemaking of strategic issues is embedded in an organizational context, organizational identity has been suggested as a critical factor affecting interpretation (Bundy, Shropshire, & Buchholtz, 2013). Organizational identity represents the shared beliefs about the central, distinctive, and enduring features of an organization (Albert & Whetten, 1985). It guides and filters individuals’ interpretation of strategic issues, shaping the meanings given to an issue (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991; Walsh, 1995). Organizational identity defines what aspects decision makers see as positive or negative and what are seen as legitimate interpretations (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991). We therefore expect that the effects of the business case frame and the paradoxical frame on issue valence will be moderated by organizational identity.

A homogeneous identity leads to a single uncontested conceptualization of what is central, distinctive, and enduring about the organization. With its strong self-reinforcing dynamic (Fiol, 2002), a homogeneous identity keeps organizational members focused on organizational goals (Pratt & Foreman, 2000). In the case of a unitary “business” identity (Albert & Whetten, 1985), the “competitive business model in which success is measured in terms of above-market returns and ever-increasing growth rates is more deeply ingrained in . . . beliefs and practices” (Hamilton & Gioia, 2009: 448). Decision makers are primed by such existing routines and are therefore less likely to integrate a diverse set of aspects in their interpretation of strategic issues (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues that include nonbusiness aspects tend to be delegitimized. In contrast, a heterogeneous identity (Gioia, Schultz, & Corley, 2000; Pratt & Foreman, 2000) admits more diverse aspects and, thus, makes ambivalent evaluations more likely (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Organizations with heterogeneous conceptualizations of their central, distinctive, and enduring features accommodate multiple interpretations (Gioia et al., 2000) and tend to have more complex relationships with a wide spectrum of external stakeholders (Brickson, 2005). In such organizations decision makers are more likely to integrate conflicting sustainability aspects in their issue evaluations, because their organization’s identity allows for attending to a wide variety of competing stakeholder demands (Hamilton & Gioia, 2009).

# Proposition 5a:

Decision makers in organizations with a homogeneous business identity are less likely to interpret sustainability issues ambivalently, which will weaken the effects of the paradoxical frame on interpretation.

# Proposition 5b:

Decision makers in organizations with a heterogeneous identity are more likely to interpret sustainability issues ambivalently, which will weaken the effects of the business case frame on interpretation.

Given the role of resource availability as an important contextual factor in strategic issue diagnosis (Dutton & Duncan, 1987), we expect resource constraints to also moderate the influence of cognitive frames on the interpretation of sustainability issues. Resource constraints influence both managerial sense of control and issue valence. In cases where “resources are abundant, decision makers are more likely to feel a sense of control . . . with respect to an issue, than when organizational resources are limited” (Denison, Dutton, Kahn, & Hart, 1996: 459), because they have the means available to deal with the issue adequately (Jackson & Dutton, 1988). In contrast, with limited resources, decision makers feel constrained by their context in the choices they can make and, thus, experience a loss of control (George et al., 2006; Jackson & Dutton, 1988). A lack of resources also makes ambivalent interpretations of strategic issues less likely, since managers tend to lack the time and resources to investi-

gate a greater diversity of aspects of the issue (Plambeck & Weber, 2010).

We expect that resource constraints will particularly influence the interpretation of sustainability issues under a paradoxical frame. Having only a moderate sense of control to start with, decision makers’ sense of control will be further reduced by resource constraints, since these individuals lack time and resources to process the broad range of aspects they perceive. In addition, in times of economic distress, financial aspects are more likely to come to the fore owing to increased shareholder pressure. This will reduce managers’ leeway to consider a wider range of environmental and social aspects that potentially conflict with financial performance. Managers will therefore be forced to take sides and interpret sustainability issues less ambivalently. However, they will feel that this more univalent interpretation is imposed on them rather than being the result of their own reasoning, which will further reduce their sense of control. In contrast, when managers with a business case frame operate under resource constraints, they will still seek univalent interpretations. Resource constraints tend to reinforce their reliance on routine procedures to ascertain the business relevance of sustainability issues in order to maintain control (George et al., 2006). Hence, resource constraints will affect such managers to a lesser degree. They will continue to settle univalently for either positive or negative evaluations, even with a low sense of control (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010). We therefore suggest the following relationship between resource availability and managerial interpretation of sustainability issues (see the dotted curve in Figure 3).

# Proposition 6:

A lack of time and resources will induce decision makers with a paradoxical frame to perceive a lower sense of control over sustainability issues and to interpret sustainability issues more univalently but will not affect the interpretation of decision makers with a business case frame.

# Responding

Once managers have interpreted ambiguous sustainability issues based on their cognitive frame, they will act on that basis. While the cognition of an individual decision maker alone will not determine organizational responses to sustainability issues, we expect that different cognitive frames will lead managers to adopt different decision-making stances. We define stance as a decision maker’s rationalized mental attitude toward an issue, which predisposes the individual to act in certain ways. We argue that the different effects we expect for the two frames with regard to depth and breadth of scanning (Mazutis, 2013) and issue interpretation in terms of sense of control and issue valence (Chattopadhyay et al., 2001; Plambeck & Weber, 2009) will result in different decision-making stances on sustainability issues—that is, either a pragmatic stance or prudent stance. We further characterize these two stances by discussing the scope, novelty, swiftness, and riskiness (Plambeck & Weber, 2009) these different types of responses entail.

As developed above, managers with a business case frame focus in detail on selected aspects of sustainability issues to understand their relevance for economic objectives. Based on focused search routines, they develop a high sense of control over the few sustainability issues they perceive and tend to evaluate these issues univalently as either clearly positive or negative for their business. Consequently, we expect these managers to consider responses that either actively approach an issue—in the case of a positive evaluation—or actively avoid it—in the case of a negative evaluation (Cacioppo, Gardner, & Berntson, 1999). To develop these responses, they refer to existing solutions that have been successfully applied to similarly interpreted issues (Ocasio, 1997): they “access common solutions when faced with common situations that are clearly positive or negative” (Plambeck & Weber, 2009: 998). Being based on incremental adaptations of routine response patterns to positive or negative business issues, the responses these managers consider will be limited in scope. This narrow focus on business routines will enable decision makers to simplify complex sustainability issues (Porac & Rosa, 1996) and to come up with swift responses once they have evaluated an issue as being relevant for economic objectives (Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).

The search for responses to sustainability issues that are in the vicinity of existing solutions also reduces the perceived riskiness and novelty of these responses (Plambeck & Weber,

2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 477

With their high sense of control based on formalized search and assessment routines, as well as existing solutions (George et al., 2006), decision makers with a business case frame tend to underestimate the risk of the responses to sustainability issues that they consider. By relying on established routines to ascertain the profitability of environmental and social investments, such as formal investment appraisal procedures (Epstein & Roy, 2003), and by referring to known solutions, such as incremental improvements of existing technologies (Hart, 1995), they strongly believe in their ability to handle and control risk (Das & Teng, 1999). The higher their sense of control, not only the lower the perceived risk but also the greater the likelihood that risk will be underestimated and the more optimistic the forecasts managers will make about the outcomes of their responses to an issue (Durand, 2003; Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). Consequently, these decision makers will be willing to consider investments of considerable magnitude as long as these do not entail radical departures from established routines but rely on skills and solutions, which they perceive they are able to master.

When responding to regulatory pressure in the European Union for lower carbon emissions during the 2000s, top management of carmaker Volkswagen followed a pragmatic stance and developed the BlueMotion line of more fuel-efficient cars based on incremental improvements of its trusted diesel technology (Financial Times, 2007). This stance, however, came at the expense of developing alternative propulsion systems, such as electric vehicles, that required a departure from existing technologies. At the same time, the BlueMotion line was deployed swiftly across the entire model range, resulting in a large-scale response. Even if this reliance on incremental improvements of conventional technology was probably insufficient to meet more stringent emission regulations in the future, Volkswagen management seemed confident in its focus on responses with limited scope but high controllability (Financial Times, 2011).

Overall, we expect that holding a business case frame will induce a stance on sustainability issues that is characterized by pragmatism. With this stance decision makers prefer “workable” solutions to sustainability issues based on strategies that remain within existing technological systems, producing as little disruption as possible (Prasad & Elmes, 2005). On the one hand, such a stance is rather parochial, since managers only consider responding to those aspects of a sustainability issue for which they perceive immediate business relevance; they will discard other aspects and fail to develop a comprehensive perspective of the issue. On the other hand, their focus on workable solutions is more likely to lead to concrete measures and responses that are actually implemented, thus “proposing working solutions for seemingly insurmountable problems” (Prasad & Elmes, 2005: 850).

Proposition 7a: The more business case oriented their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to adopt a pragmatic stance on sustainability issues.

Building on their broad but less detailed scanning on a wide range of sustainability issues, managers with a paradoxical frame experience a moderate sense of control and develop ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues that integrate positive as well as negative evaluations with regard to economic, environmental, and social outcomes. This ambivalence simultaneously activates response patterns for approaching positive and avoiding negative aspects (Cacioppo et al., 1999; Plambeck & Weber, 2009). Managers will consider not only environmental and social aspects that provide financial benefits but also aspects where such benefits are unclear, or even unlikely. Their cognitive ability to accommodate conflicting aspects enables them to consider responses with a broader scope that are internally consistent, but “may be inconsistent or contradictory across [responses]” (Smith, Binns, & Tushman, 2010: 449). However, the higher cognitive complexity associated with ambivalence impedes swift responses (Levinthal & Rerup, 2006; Porac & Rosa, 1996), since decision makers take more time to assess and integrate more diverse and potentially competing aspects of a sustainability issue (Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).

Because ambivalence activates a broad set of positive as well as negative evaluations of a sustainability issue simultaneously, managers with a paradoxical frame tend to perceive issues as unique. Consequently, they feel that these issues cannot be adequately addressed through existing solutions and routines, and this

triggers a search for alternative responses (March & Simon, 1958). During the search for alternative responses, the activation of different response patterns increases the “likelihood of finding multiple [yet competing] responses that match the issue” (Plambeck & Weber, 2009: 998). This brings together response repertoires that are usually applied separately—for instance, working with peripheral stakeholders, such as social activists (Hart & Sharma, 2004), while defending established business practices. While decision makers with a paradoxical frame perceive a greater novelty of the responses they consider, their tendency to see sustainability issues as unique problems also heightens the perceived riskiness of their responses (Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). Managers with a paradoxical frame do not underestimate the riskiness of potential responses because they lack established routines and have only a moderate sense of control. Rather, they accept that there is some uncontrollable risk. To handle risk they avoid taking a stand on the issue too early and keep their options open (Das & Teng, 1999). Thus, while decision makers with a paradoxical frame see the need to consider novel and unusual responses that go beyond existing routines, they are aware of the risk that is associated with such responses. In particular, they are aware that addressing sustainability issues comprehensively entails conflict and undesired side effects. As research in environmental psychology has shown, this awareness of ambivalent effects of more comprehensive responses to sustainability issues lowers the propensity to take concrete action (Castro et al., 2009; Costarelli & Colloca, 2004).

Recent debates on sustainability issues in agribusiness—food security, biodiversity loss, and genetically modified seeds—illustrate the impact of ambivalence on the types of response decision makers consider. For example, Unilever’s sustainability manager recently conveyed an ambivalent position on organic agriculture by emphasizing a reluctance to go fully organic because this would jeopardize food production on the usual scale (NRC, 2013). Yet at the same time Unilever’s upper management pioneered novel sustainable agriculture practices (Whiteman et al., 2013). These have resulted in innovative practices for sustainable agriculture but have had limited business impact, since “it was difficult (at the time) to translate the treatments involving extreme reductions in fertilizers and pesticides into marketable stories” (Pretty et al., 2008: 57–58). Ambivalence on the part of Unilever’s management regarding organic farming led to innovative solutions going beyond using established routines, but these innovations were used on a small scale only.

Overall, we expect that holding a paradoxical frame will induce a stance on sustainability issues that is characterized by prudence. On the one hand, with their comprehensive view on sustainability issues, these managers will see the need to consider responses that break with established routines and business practices in order to achieve environmental and social benefits at the societal level. On the other hand, they will be aware of “the massive uncertainty and unpredictability, nonlinear interaction between system components, unknown thresholds, and complex dynamics in ecological and social systems” (Gladwin et al., 1995: 879) and, hence, tend to approach sustainability issues by moving slowly and carefully (Das & Teng, 1999). Decision makers with a paradoxical frame might even perceive sustainability issues as overly problematic, which would prevent them from envisaging workable solutions and assuming responsibilities for their practical implementation (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982).

# Proposition 7b

The more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to adopt a prudent stance on sustainability issues.

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Our main objective in this article is to develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We advance theoretical understanding of the stance managers take on sustainability issues by proposing how two ideal-type cognitive frames, with their differences in content and structure, affect the stages of the sensemaking process of ambiguous issues. In previous research scholars have underlined the importance of managerial cognition and sensemaking of sustainability (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Byrch et al., 2007; Sharma, 2000; Sharma et al., 1999); we add to this literature by offering a more fine-grained understanding of the role individual cognition plays in managerial decision making on corporate sustainability. By address-

ing a wider variety of alternative cognitive frames, we advance research in corporate sustainability, which so far has almost exclusively relied on business case thinking (Bansal, 2005; Gao & Bansal, 2013; Hahn et al., 2010).

As our main contribution, we advance theorizing about managerial decision making on sustainability issues. Building on previous work on the role of interpretation of sustainability issues in explaining strategic choice (Sharma, 2000), we uncover the effects of differences in cognitive frames on the underlying sensemaking process that links cognition with a manager’s decision-making stance. This cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability connects to a number of key aspects of the debate on managerial interpretations of and responses to sustainability issues. For instance, while the strategic management literature has recently drawn attention to the role of ambivalent issue interpretations (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010), the corresponding debate in the sustainability literature has remained within an opportunity/threat dichotomy (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Sharma, 2000). We advance this field of research not only by introducing ambivalent managerial interpretations of sustainability issues but also by elaborating on the cognitive determinants of univalent and ambivalent interpretations. In previous research on the antecedents of managers’ ambivalent interpretation of strategic issues, scholars have focused on organizational factors (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Our cognitive framing perspective adds individual-level factors to the picture. While Barr, Stimpert, and Huff (1992) found that decision makers’ cognitive frames link cues from the organizational context to managerial decision making, we explain how differences in the content and structure of a manager’s frame act at the different stages of the sensemaking process.

As another important implication, we add to research on the different types of responses managers consider with regard to sustainability issues. In this context, a manager’s sense of control and perception of risk have been discussed as key determinants of the choice of different responses (George et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 1993) and of associated decision-making biases (Das & Teng, 1999; Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). Our analysis of the effects of differences in frame content and frame structure sheds new light on the sometimes contradictory implications that have resulted from the application of different theoretical lenses to managerial risk and perceptions of control (Chattopadhyay et al., 2001; George et al., 2006). We suggest that with different cognitive frames managers’ sense of control over an issue may stem from fundamentally different sources. Likewise, we expect managers to perceive and deal with the riskiness of potential responses differently, depending on which of the two frames they hold. These cognitively determined differences have important implications for managerial decision making on ambiguous sustainability issues. The pragmatic and prudent stances that we expect to be associated with the business case frame and the paradoxical frame, respectively, suggest that commonly used classifications of issue responses along general classifications, such as the reactive, defensive, accommodative, and proactive (RDAP) scale (Clarkson, 1995; Wartick & Cochran, 1985), may be too simplistic. Managers with a pragmatic stance favor responses of limited scope based on established routines and practices, which considerably limits their proactiveness, yet their propensity to develop workable solutions can potentially bring about large-scale change. Managers with a prudent stance may consider unusual and more radical departures from established routines, yet they are hampered in their ability to implement workable solutions because of their ambivalence and higher awareness of risk and tensions. The often-bemoaned reluctance of firms and their managers to address in a radical fashion the immense challenges that sustainability presents (Whiteman et al., 2013) may thus be rooted in the cognitive predispositions and limitations inherent in both frames. Owing to their pragmatic stance, managers with a business case frame rarely consider deviating from established routines but rely instead on incrementalism; paradoxically minded managers may well see the need to consider bolder responses to sustainability issues but shy away from such endeavors since they are hampered by ambivalence and prudence.

This argument highlights the need to address the interplay of the two cognitive types, since both business case and paradoxical frames have their role to play in bringing about change but may operate at different stages. Because they go beyond a focus on economic attributes alone, the relatively few managers with a more

paradoxical frame might act as pioneers to propose comprehensive responses that depart from existing routines. However, the translation of these responses into practice may well require managers with a more business case–oriented frame, who are cognitively predisposed to reducing the complexity of sustainability issues to a level that enables the implementation of these novel practices at a large scale. Neither of the two frames alone will be sufficient to bring about managerial responses that measure up to the immense challenges sustainability presents.

The interplay of different cognitive types has various practical and theoretical implications. With regard to managerial practice, in the nascent field of sustainable human resource management (Ehnert, 2009), the composition of teams of different cognitive types may play an important role in the management of sustainability issues. Mirroring findings on the combination of different cognitive styles in the composition of successful innovation teams (Miron-Spektor, Erez, & Naveh, 2011), teams dominated by either business case–minded or paradoxical types may be less successful in implementing innovative responses to sustainability challenges than mixed teams. By avoiding a strong bias in such teams toward one of the two cognitive types, firms can make sure they remain aware of the complexity of sustainability issues (due to the presence of paradoxical types) without losing sight of the need to implement workable solutions (due to the presence of business case types).

Our argument also has theoretical implications for the growing body of literature on hybrid organizations. While this literature conceptualizes conflicting financial and social goals in terms of competing institutional logics (Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Pache & Santos, 2013), our focus on the interplay of different cognitive types highlights the relevance of individual-level factors when organizations face competing demands. Our argument suggests that the presence of decision makers who accept competing financial, environmental, and social objectives through paradoxical thinking (Smith, Gonin, & Besharov, 2013) might not be sufficient. Rather, the coexistence and the interplay of different cognitive types, where some are aware of tensions but others are not, appear to play a critical role not only for the management of corporate sustainability in for-profit firms but also for the successful implementation of hybrid business models.

Finally, we believe that addressing a greater cognitive diversity of managers promises considerable further insights into the nature and contingencies of managerial responses to issues other than sustainability that are also characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects and where the debate is also dominated by a business case perspective. For instance, diversity in organizations represents a complex issue that scholars and managers alike often frame as having business value (Herring, 2009; Robinson & Dechant, 1997). Here, too, business benefits are unclear (Cox & Blake, 1991), and critical voices call for approaches that go beyond business case thinking (O’Leary & Weathington, 2006). We expect that considering alternative frames on such an issue will shed new light on how and why decision makers approach diversity issues in different ways.

We propose two ideal-type cognitive frames through which individuals make sense of sustainability issues, based on different views on how economic, environmental, and social dimensions relate to each other, a key debate in corporate sustainability (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). However, we acknowledge that frames can be based on various rationales (Zietsma & Vertinsky, 1999). Cognitive perspectives that correspond to other debates within the corporate sustainability literature will result in alternative ideal-type frames and promise further insights into the effects of frame content and structure on managerial responses to sustainability issues.

While not being exhaustive, Table 2 offers a starting point for exploring such alternative frames. One set of frames may form around governance issues, exploring the question of who is responsible for taking action to address sustainability concerns—for example, private sector versus state (Matten & Crane, 2005; Reinhardt, Stavins, & Vietor, 2008). Other frame sets could relate to the discussion of different motivations to take action on sustainability—for example, altruism versus (enlightened) self-interest (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Jensen, 2001)—or could address the different time dimensions that are being discussed in the sustainability literature—for example, present generations versus future generations (Held, 2001; Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).

We contribute to the discussion of alternative cognitive frames by going beyond a descriptive typology (Zietsma & Vertinsky, 1999) to address in detail the effects of differences in frame content and structure. However, we do not suggest that any particular frame automatically determines the sensemaking of decision makers. Rather, we expect that the effects of managers’ cognitive frames on their decision making will be moderated by a range of personal, situational, and contextual factors. We propose that the effects of the two frames on scanning and interpretation will be attenuated by the functional background of managers and by organizational identity, respectively. In addition, our argument on the availability of resources illustrates that not all frames are susceptible to contextual factors. Some cognitive constraints, as in the case of narrow scanning by business case–minded decision makers, cannot be simply overcome by providing abundant resources, whereas in other instances—for example, with the sense of control of paradoxically minded managers—resource constraints prevail over cognitive predispositions. The moderators we propose provide only an initial step toward understanding the various factors that influence the role of cognitive frames. We are aware that there are further relevant moderating factors, beyond the individual- and the organizational-level factors we address, providing ample opportunities for future research into a cognitive framing perspective on managerial sensemaking of ambiguous issues. It would be particularly fruitful to address the moderating role of institutional factors since these prime and trigger cognitive frames (Weber & Glynn, 2006). Future research could thus investigate how multiple, competing institutional logics (Besharov & Smith, 2014; Jay, 2013) moderate the effect of cognitive frames on sustainability decision making.

Another relevant question for future research refers to the origin of cognitive frames. Since managers’ frames “do not spring up randomly, but rather are the encoding of their prior history” (Kaplan & Tripsas, 2008: 791), we would expect that a range of factors at personal, organizational, and institutional levels will influence the formation of cognitive content and structure. With regard to personal background, researchers have argued that personality traits, such as need for closure (Webster & Kruglanski, 1994) and tolerance for ambiguity (Furnham & Ribchester, 1995), play an important role in sensemaking under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity (McKenzie, Woolf, van Winkelen, & Morgan, 2009). With regard to the organization as a context for managerial decision making (Gioia & Thomas, 1996; Weick, 1979), the influence of organizational structure on managers’ cognition (Hannaway, 1985) may differ between centralized and decentralized organizations (Pugh et al., 1963). Moreover, since managers’ cognitive frames are shaped by the particular institutional fields they have been exposed to (Weber & Glynn, 2006), dominant and contested institutional logics (Purdy & Gray, 2009; Reay & Hinings, 2009) may prime different cues and privilege certain frames over others (Weber & Glynn, 2006). Future research into the antecedents of the business case frame and the paradoxical frame will help us to understand who the managers are that are more likely to adopt a pragmatic or a prudent stance on sustainability issues.

Our focus on cognition at the individual level raises the question of how different cognitive frames and the resulting decision-making.

stances relate to organizational action (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Thomas et al., 1993). We see at least two key aspects at the interface between individual cognition and organizational action that merit further investigation: the activation of frames and the dominance of frames. A better understanding of the factors that trigger a stronger or weaker activation of the two frames promises relevant insights. Such factors may be found within the organization—for instance, in an organizational climate of participation (Tesluk, Vance, & Mathieu, 1999) and creativity (Ekvall, 1996)— or outside the organization—in major regulative, technological, or economic discontinuities (Griffith, 1999; Tushman, Newman, & Romanelli, 1986). Moreover, since managerial cognition is a social process within an organizational context (Daft & Weick, 1984), individual frames will only translate into organizational action when they are transformed “into the organization’s predominant collective frames” (Kaplan, 2008: 730). Collective cognitive frames are the outcome of a political process where organizational members compete over the dominant interpretation of an issue (Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991). Future research could address the factors that enable decision makers to translate their own cognitive frame into the dominant collective frame. Overall, further development of the cognitive framing perspective may result in a more comprehensive theory that establishes a connection among individual history, cognition, and agency.

We believe that our cognitive framing perspective and our propositions provide ample opportunities for future empirical studies. Given the nascent state of research into tensions and cognitive diversity in sustainability, scholars may find it most fruitful to use both quantitative and qualitative methods (Edmondson & McManus, 2007). However, testing our propositions through quantitative research presupposes the development of measurement scales for the business case frame and the paradoxical frame. To gain insights into the cognitive processes of decision makers who use business case frames or paradoxical frames, (semi-)qualitative methods, such as interviews, content analyses, and exploratory case studies, will be particularly suitable (Gregoire, Barr, & Shepherd, 2010; Luscher & Lewis, 2008).

In conclusion, we believe that a cognitive framing perspective offers a better understanding of managerial decision making on sustainability issues by recognizing the importance of a greater cognitive diversity of managers with regard to the content and structure of their frames. Our goal in this research, therefore, has not been to advocate a specific cognitive frame but, rather, to pave the way for the consideration of different cognitive perspectives on complex and ambiguous issues, such as corporate sustainability.

# Corporate Social and Financial Performance: A Meta-analysis

# Authors

Marc Orlitzky, Frank L. Schmidt, Sara L. Rynes

# Abstract

Most theorizing on the relationship between corporate social/environmental performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) assumes that the current evidence is too fractured or too variable to draw any generalizable conclusions. With this integrative, quantitative study, we intend to show that the mainstream claim that we have little generalizable knowledge about CSP and CFP is built on shaky grounds. Providing a methodologically more rigorous review than previous efforts, we conduct a meta-analysis of 52 studies (which represent the population of prior quantitative inquiry) yielding a total sample size of 33,878 observations. The meta-analytic findings suggest that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is likely to pay off, although the operationalizations of CSP and CFP also moderate the positive association. For example, CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators, and CSP reputation indices are more highly correlated with CFP than are other indicators of CSP. This meta-analysis establishes a greater degree of certainty with respect to the CSP–CFP relationship than is currently assumed to exist by many business scholars.

# Introduction

The performance of business organizations is affected by their strategies and operations in market and non-market environments (Baron 2000). The increasing power of activist groups and the media in pluralist western societies can be expected to make organizations’ non-market strategies even more important. One construct that might capture a major element of these non-market strategies is corporate social performance (CSP). CSP can be defined as ‘a business organization’s configuration of principles of social responsibility, processes of social responsiveness, and policies, programs, and observable outcomes as they relate to the firm’s societal relationships’ (Wood 1991a: 693).

The impression that ‘in the aggregate, results are inconclusive’ regarding any theoretical conclusions about the relationship between CSP and corporate financial performance (CFP) has persisted until today (Jones and Wicks 1999: 212; cf. also Donaldson 1999; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Roman et al. 1999). Ullmann (1985) and Wood and Jones (1995) argued that during the past three decades of empirical research on this relationship, researchers have engaged in a futile search for stable causal patterns. A number of narrative reviews and theories (for example, Aupperle et al. 1985; Griffin and Mahon 1997; Husted 2000; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985; Wartick and Cochran 1985; Wood 1991a, 1991b; Wood and Jones 1995) have proposed conceptual explanations for the existence (or lack thereof) of a causal relationship between CSP and CFP, but failed to provide clear answers. Previous reviews of this area have suggested that such factors as stakeholder mismatching (Wood and Jones 1995), the general neglect of contingency factors (for example, Ullmann 1985), and measurement errors (for example, Waddock and Graves 1997) may explain inconsistent findings. Other authors, failing to see important differences between theory and operational context, are even more pessimistic and call for a moratorium of CSP–CFP research (Margolis and Walsh 2001; Rowley and Berman 2000). Before we embark on a costly search for contingencies or abandon a line of inquiry altogether, a theoretically and empirically meaningful integration of this area might be useful. In this article, we argue that this line of inquiry contains a number of theoretical conclusions that have hitherto been overlooked or ignored by many organizational scholars.

This article presents a meta-analytic review of primary quantitative studies of the CSP–CFP relationship. Meta-analysis has proven to be a useful technique in many substantive areas where multiple individual studies have yielded inconclusive or conflicting results (for example, Damanpour 1991; Datta et al. 1992; Gooding and Wagner 1985; Schwenk 1989; see also Hedges 1987; Hunt 1997; Rosenthal and DiMatteo 2001; and Schmidt 1992 for broader reviews of meta-analysis). By statistically aggregating results across individual studies and correcting for statistical artefacts such as sampling error and measurement error, psychometric meta-analysis allows for much greater precision than other forms of research reviews. Ironically, those researchers that question the meaningfulness of the CSP–CFP research stream the most (Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001) have integrated the empirical evidence with the so-called ‘vote-counting’ technique, which, for a variety of reasons, has been shown to be invalid by many statistical experts (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Rosenthal 1995; Schmidt 1992). When, in ‘vote counting’, studies are simply coded as showing significantly positive, negative, or statistically non-significant results, conclusions are likely to be false (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). In contrast, psychometric meta-analysis quantifies the impact of theoretical and methodological deficiencies in a given line of inquiry and is, therefore, at present, the most sophisticated research-integration technique.

The specific objectives of this meta-analysis are to: (1) provide a statistical integration of the accumulated research on the relationship between CSP and CFP.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

CFP; (2) assess the relative predictive validity of instrumental stakeholder theory in the context of the CSP–CFP relationship; and (3) examine several moderators, such as operationalization of CSP and CFP (that is, measurement strategies) and timing of CSP and CFP measurement. In so doing, it builds on earlier research by: (a) including market (stock) return measures in addition to accounting returns; (b) including CSP measures other than social-responsibility audits performed by Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co., Inc.; (c) responding to Waddock and Graves’ (1997: 315) call for research on the temporal consistency of results, independent of the time lag chosen between CSP and CFP measures; and (d) integrating empirical results across diverse study contexts and enabling us to look for theoretical moderators and statistical artefacts that might explain the highly variable results across previous studies.

# Theory and Hypotheses

# Overall CSP–CFP Relationship

Instrumental stakeholder theory (for example, Clarkson 1995; Cornell and Shapiro 1987; Donaldson and Preston 1995; Freeman 1984; Mitchell et al. 1997 (the classification of these studies as exemplifying ‘instrumental stakeholder theory’ was made ex post)) suggests a positive relationship between CSP and CFP. According to this theory, the satisfaction of various stakeholder groups is instrumental for organizational financial performance (Donaldson and Preston 1995; Jones 1995). Stakeholder-agency theory argues that the implicit and explicit negotiation and contracting processes entailed by reciprocal, bilateral stakeholder–management relationships serve as monitoring and enforcement mechanisms that prevent managers from diverting attention from broad organizational financial goals (Hill and Jones 1992; Jones 1995). Furthermore, by addressing and balancing the claims of multiple stakeholders (Freeman and Evan 1990), managers can increase the efficiency of their organization’s adaptation to external demands.

Additionally, according to a firm-as-contract analysis (Freeman and Evan 1990), high corporate performance results not only from the separate satisfaction of bilateral relationships (Hill and Jones 1992), but also from the simultaneous coordination and prioritization of multilateral stakeholder interests. These strategic and tactical steps may be necessary to reduce the likelihood of the organization’s becoming stuck in a high-density network. High network density can reduce CFP in a number of ways (Rowley 1997). For example, in a high-density network, firms may become stuck in the role of compromiser or subordinate, depending on the degree of the firm’s network centrality (Rowley 1997). Either of these roles may lead to further consumption of valuable firm resources such as time, labour, and capital. Conversely, high CSP bolsters a company’s competitive advantage by weighing and addressing the claims of various constituents in a fair, rational manner. This perspective, which is primarily derived from instrumental.

stakeholder theory (Jones 1995), has also been identified as the ‘good management theory’ (Waddock and Graves 1997). Therefore, we predict that:

# H1:

Corporate social performance and financial performance are generally positively related across a wide variety of industry and study contexts.

# Temporal Sequence

Like the ‘good management theory’, slack resources theory also proposes a positive association between CSP and CFP. However, it proposes a different temporal ordering — namely, that prior CFP is directly associated with subsequent CSP. Prior high levels of CFP may provide the slack resources necessary to engage in corporate social responsibility and responsiveness (Ullmann 1985; Waddock and Graves 1997). Because CSP often represents an area of relatively high managerial discretion, the initiation or cancellation of voluntary social and environmental policies may, to a large extent, depend on the availability of excess funds (McGuire et al. 1988).

To distinguish between slack resources theory and the good management theory, the meta-analytic data set will be examined for three sets of temporal associations: (a) prior CSP related to subsequent CFP; (b) prior CFP related to subsequent CSP; and (c) contemporaneous (cross-sectional) associations. If effect sizes are highly similar across all three meta-analytic subgroups, Waddock and Graves’s (1997) argument about a virtuous cycle between CSP and CFP would be supported irrespective of study context, sampling error, and measurement error. Based on prior theory and empirical findings (McGuire et al. 1990; Waddock and Graves 1997), we believe that both instrumental stakeholder theory and slack resources descriptions are accurate, such that the two constructs are related to each other reciprocally.

# H2:

There is bidirectional causality between corporate social performance and financial performance.

# Mediating Effects

CSP may be an organizational resource that provides internal or external benefits, or both. Internally, investments in CSP may help firms develop new competencies, resources, and capabilities which are manifested in a firm’s culture, technology, structure, and human resources (Barney 1991; Russo and Fouts 1997; Wernerfelt 1984). Especially when CSP is pre-emptive (Hart 1995) and a firm’s environment is dynamic or complex, CSP may help build managerial competencies because preventive efforts necessitate significant employee involvement, organization-wide coordination, and a forward-thinking managerial style (Shrivastava 1995). Thus, CSP can help management develop better scanning skills, processes, and information systems, which increase the organization’s preparedness for external changes, turbulence, and crises (for example, Russo and Fouts 1997).

which are acquired internally through the CSP process, would then lead to more efficient utilization of resources (Majumdar and Marcus 2001). According to the ‘internal resources/learning’ perspective, whether CSP behaviours and outcomes are also disclosed to outside constituents is largely irrelevant to the development of internal capabilities and organizational efficiency.

In addition, however, CSP may have external effects on organizational reputation. According to the reputation perspective, an organization’s communication with external parties about its level of CSP may help build a positive image with customers, investors, bankers, and suppliers (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). Firms high in CSP may use corporate social responsibility disclosures as one of the informational signals upon which stakeholders base their assessments of corporate reputation under conditions of incomplete information (Fombrun and Shanley 1990). Furthermore, firms with high CSP reputation ratings may improve relations with bankers and investors and thus facilitate their access to capital (Spicer 1978). They may also attract better employees (Greening and Turban 2000; Turban and Greening 1997) or increase current employees’ goodwill, which in turn may improve financial outcomes (Davis 1973; McGuire et al. 1988; Waddock and Graves 1997). In sum, the reputation perspective postulates reputational effects as mediators of the CSP–CFP linkage, while the internal-resources perspective proposes managerial competencies and learning as the intervening generative mechanism between a positive CSP–CFP association. Therefore, we propose that:

# H3: CSP is positively correlated with CFP because (a) CSP increases managerial competencies, contributes to organizational knowledge about the firm’s market, social, political, technological, and other environments, and thus enhances organizational efficiency, and (b) CSP helps the firm build a positive reputation and goodwill with its external stakeholders.

# Measurement Strategy: An Important Moderator Variable

Because both CSP and CFP are such broad meta-constructs, a given study’s operationalization of each construct may act as an important moderator. To test this hypothesis, the entire meta-analytic set is broken down into different CFP and CSP subsets employing different measurement strategies. This breakdown can establish whether correlations between different CSP and CFP measures are similar across subgroups, or whether different operationalizations lead to systematically different effect sizes across studies. The following section gives an overview of how CFP and CSP have been measured in the past.

The three broad subdivisions of CFP consist of market-based (investor returns), accounting-based (accounting returns), and perceptual (survey) measures. First, market-based measures of CFP, such as price per share or share price appreciation, reflect the notion that shareholders are a primary stakeholder group whose satisfaction determines the company’s fate (Cochran).

# 24(3)

The bidding and asking processes of stock-market participants, who rely on their perceptions of past, current, and future stock returns and risk, determine a firm’s stock price and thus market value. Alternatively, accounting-based indicators, such as the firm’s return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), or earnings per share (EPS), capture a firm’s internal efficiency in some way (Cochran and Wood 1984). Accounting returns are subject to managers’ discretionary allocations of funds to different projects and policy choices, and thus reflect internal decision-making capabilities and managerial performance rather than external market responses to organizational (non-market) actions. Lastly, perceptual measures of CFP ask survey respondents to provide subjective estimates of, for instance, the firm’s ‘soundness of financial position’, ‘wise use of corporate assets’, or ‘financial goal achievement relative to competitors’ (Conine and Madden 1987; Reimann 1975; Wartick 1988).

The construct of CSP is associated with the following four broad measurement strategies: (a) CSP disclosures; (b) CSP reputation ratings; (c) social audits, CSP processes, and observable outcomes; and (d) managerial CSP principles and values (Post 1991). First, CSP disclosure measurement consists of content analysis of annual reports, letters to shareholders, 10Ks, and a number of other corporate disclosures to the public as surrogates of CSP. Content analysis is employed to compare units of text against particular CSP themes in order to draw inferences about the organization’s underlying social performance (Wolfe 1991).

A second approach to measuring CSP is the use of reputational indices, such as Moskowitz’s (1972, 1975) tripartite ratings (‘outstanding’, ‘honourable mention’, and ‘worst’ companies; for example, Cochran and Wood 1984; Sturdivant and Ginter 1977) or Fortune magazine ratings of a corporation’s ‘responsibility to the community and environment’ (for example, Conine and Madden 1987; Fombrun and Shanley 1990; McGuire et al. 1988). Other researchers (Alexander and Buchholz 1978; Heinze 1976; Vance 1975) have developed their own reputational measures by surveying business professionals and business students. Reputation indices are based on the assumption that CSP reputations are good reflections of underlying CSP values and behaviours.

Social audits and concrete observable CSP processes and outcomes are the third broad measurement category of CSP. Social audits consist of a systematic third-party effort to assess a firm’s ‘objective’ CSP behaviours, such as community service, environmental programmes, and corporate philanthropy. Objective data are the foundation for so-called ‘behavioural’ measures of CSP. However, behavioural measures based on social audits may still result in a ranking, such as the measure provided by the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP). Various studies have used the CEP social audit rankings of companies’ pollution records (for example, Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Fogler and Nutt 1975; Spicer 1978; see also the overview of studies in Appendix A). Although this subset of studies differs from the other three subsets, it is still very broad. Therefore, this third group will be broken down further to examine the instrumental effectiveness of processes of social responsiveness.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

The fourth measurement category of CSP assesses the values and principles inherent in a company’s culture. Aupperle (1984) developed a forced-choice survey of corporate social orientations, drawing on Carroll’s (1979) corporate social responsibility construct with its four dimensions of economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary responsibilities. The last three elements comprise the construct ‘concern for society’. Volume 12 of Research in Corporate Social Performance and Policy (Post 1991: Part III, 265–401) reviews in greater depth the history and psychometric properties of the different CSP measures briefly delineated here (Aupperle 1991; Carroll 1991; Clarkson 1991; Gephardt 1991; Wokutch and McKinney 1991; Wolfe 1991; Wolfe and Aupperle 1991).

Differences in CSP–CFP statistical associations across these four measurement subsets may result from three sources. First, there might be ‘real’ (substantive) cross-study variation in correlations between CSP and CFP, as predicted by Wood and Jones’s (1995) mismatching thesis. Wood and Jones (1995) argued that effects would vary depending on expectations and evaluations of CSP, which differ from one stakeholder group to another. No positive correlations would be expected between measures that cannot be linked theoretically, such as CSP disclosures and accounting-based efficiency measures of CFP. For example, Wood and Jones’s (1995) review suggested that the match between market measures and market-oriented stakeholders (for example, customers) would produce significant positive results, while the correlation between market measures and charitable contributions, for instance, would not.

Alternatively, differences in correlations across variable measurement subsets may simply be a function of statistical artefacts. For example, if one measurement subgroup were found to contain many studies with very small sample sizes, this subgroup would show a relatively large random sampling error. Thus, differences in sampling error across measurement subgroups may explain CSP/CFP correlational differences in primary studies. In addition, measurement error of CFP and CSP (that is, unreliability) might act as another artefactual source of cross-study variability in correlations. If, for example, CSP disclosure measures were plagued by comparatively low psychometric quality (for example, Abbott and Monsen 1979; Ingram and Frazier 1980; Wiseman 1982), observed correlations between CSP disclosures and CFP would be systematically lower than the correlations between CFP and other, more reliable measures of CSP. Therefore, this meta-analysis hierarchically breaks down the overall data set in order to compare the relative magnitudes of correlations arising from different CSP and CFP measurement subcategories, and to test for these three possible sources of cross-study variation of correlations (substantive differences, sampling error, and measurement error). We hypothesize that:

# H4a:

A large proportion of cross-study variance is due to statistical or methodological artefacts (sampling error and measurement error).

# H4b:

Consistent with stakeholder mismatching, after accounting for statistical artefacts, there will still be differences in the statistical associations between different sub-dimensions of CFP and CSP (after correct matching).

# Methods

Prior summaries of the CSP–CFP literature have relied mostly on narrative reviews (for example, Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985) or the vote-counting method of aggregation (for example, Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Wood and Jones 1995). Narrative reviews are literature reviews that attempt to make sense of past findings verbally or conceptually. The vote-counting method refers to the cumulation of significance levels or, in the simplest case, to the tabulation of significant and non-significant findings (Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Light and Smith 1971). Both of these research integration techniques tend to draw false inferences because they do not correct for sampling and measurement error, two important study artefacts (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). In fact, the statistical errors in the typical ‘vote-counting’ literature review tend to be more serious than in the average narrative review because the statistical power of the vote-counting procedure decreases with increasing.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

number of studies reviewed (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). Although we have known for more than 20 years that vote counting is marred by a lack of validity, the technique is still widely used today (for example, Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis and Walsh 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Wood and Jones 1995).

In contrast, effect-size (r) meta-analysis is a rigorous approach to external validation, which calculates population parameter estimates (ρ) by correcting for the aforementioned artefacts. The effect of sampling error is important because sample sizes that are smaller than the population cause observed sample correlation statistics r to vary randomly from the population parameter, the true-score correlation ρ. In addition, as mentioned before, measurement error (that is, unreliability) systematically attenuates observed correlations (Nunnally and Bernstein 1994).

# Search for Relevant Studies

Computer searches of ABI/Inform Global and PsycINFO were conducted, using the keyword search ‘organizational effectiveness and corporate social performance’. Synonyms for the former, used in separate computer searches, were ‘organizational performance’, ‘profitability’, ‘economic success’, and ‘financial performance’. ‘Corporate social performance’ as a keyword search term was alternately substituted with ‘(corporate) social responsibility’, ‘corporate environmental performance’, ‘responsiveness’, and simply ‘resp?’. ABI/Inform Global gives access to the full text and images of more than 1,200 US and international business and trade journal articles (1970-current), while PsycINFO indexes abstracts of journal articles and book chapters in psychology starting in 1974. To increase the scope of our search, cross-citations from previous narrative reviews (for example, Aldag and Bartol 1978; McGuire et al. 1988: 857 –860; Preston 1978a; Waddock and Mahon 1991; Wood and Jones 1995) were explored as well.

# Criteria for Relevance

The studies that were deemed relevant for the meta-analysis had the following characteristics. First, the studies quantitatively examined the relationship between CSP and CFP. The reported effect size did not have to be a Pearsons’ product-moment correlation r, but could also be a t-test statistic or effect size t d (both t and d can be transformed to r; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). Second, the studies were concerned with at least one aspect of a firm’s economic performance, as circumscribed by the definition of CFP. For the purpose of this study, CFP was defined as a company’s financial viability, or the extent to which a company achieves its economic goals (Price and Mueller 1986; Venkatraman and Ramanujam 1986). Third, all retrieved studies were double-checked for conformance to Wood’s (1991a) definition of CSP (see Introduction above). Wood’s (1991a) now classic definition is used because it is one of the most influential, helpful, parsimonious, and yet comprehensive conceptualizations of CSP. If the particular variable could not be classified.

# Organization Studies

# 24(3)

as an example belonging to one of the nine subcategories of Wood’s model, the study was excluded. In addition, unclear reporting of empirical results was also a reason for exclusion.

Studies of environmental management and CFP are included in the meta-analysis for several reasons. First, several studies, especially earlier ones, use environmental performance as a proxy for social responsibility. Second, stakeholder proxies, such as environmental interest groups and government agencies, may in fact give voice to, or claim a social ‘stake’ for, non-human nature (Starik 1995). Lastly, the business community tends to regard social responsibility as including both social and environmental performance (for example, Willums 1999). Still, the argument can be made that the literature on CSP differs from the one on corporate environmental performance in various aspects. To investigate differences between social and environmental performance, the entire set (k = number of effect sizes integrated = 388) is disaggregated into purely social performance measures only (that is, excluding all environmental performance measures; k = 249) and environmental measures only (k = 139).

# Characteristics of Primary Studies

The most important study characteristics, such as author(s), date of study, study sample size N i, observed r or transformed and/or partially corrected r (that is, corrected for dichotomization and unequal sample sizes in the two groups compared in a t-test), number of correlations per study, operationalization of CSP and CFP, and estimates of reliability are listed in Appendix A.

Reliability is traditionally defined as the ratio of true-score variance to observed-score variance (Traub 1994). Thus, classical measurement theory is concerned with the correspondence between observed scores and true scores. Some of the reliability coefficients used in this study are in the tradition of classical reliability theory, such as coefficient alpha. Sometimes, however, it becomes necessary to count not only variation due to item sampling, but also day-to-day variation in scores as measurement error. In classical theory, one can accomplish this task by using an alternate-forms coefficient of reliability. Generalizability theory is less restrictive in its assumptions than classical theory (Cronbach et al. 1972). The coefficient of generalizability reflects the degree to which observed scores (of CSP or CFP in this case) allow for generalization about a firm’s behaviour in a defined universe of situations (Cronbach et al. 1972; Shavelson et al. 1989). Generalizability is estimated through ‘alternate-forms’ correlations between different CSP, and CFP, measures.

The present study estimates reliability by including coefficients of generalizability (76 percent), stability (4 percent), internal reliability (8 percent), and inter-rater reliability (12 percent). Both stability and generalizability coefficients are underestimates of reliability (Orlitzky 1998). Because of the predominance of coefficients of stability and generalizability, the meta-analysis provides conservative estimates (that is, lower-bound estimates) of the reliability of the CSP or CFP measurement instrument.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

In addition to listing the reliabilities of both constructs, Appendix A shows the great variety of study contexts and operationalizations of both constructs. From the vantage point of generating cumulative knowledge, multiple operationism is an advantage because it helps determine whether a ‘true’ relationship exists in different industry contexts with different operationalizations of the two focal constructs (Cook and Campbell 1979; Cooper 1989; Webb et al. 1981). In past meta-analyses, integrated studies often contained broad meta-constructs as well, such as job or organizational performance, operationalized in many different ways (for example, Gooding and Wagner 1985; Ketchen et al. 1997; Roth et al. 1996; Wagner and Gooding 1987). During data collection, the inclusion criteria for relevance (see above) served as constant checks on the operationalizations’ conformance to the broad conceptual definitions of CSP and CFP.

Empirically, the standard deviation of ρ serves as an indicator of cross-study heterogeneity. The percentage of cross-study variance explained by artefacts is another indicator of the degree of cross-study generalizability (Hunter and Schmidt 1990).

# Statistical Conventions Used in the Meta-analysis

The meta-analysis uses Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) statistical aggregation techniques for cumulating correlations and correcting for various study artefacts in order to estimate the true score correlation (ρ) between CSP and CFP. Meta-analysis arrives at a mean true-score correlation by correcting observed correlations for sampling error (which can be written as σe = (1−ρ2) / (N−1)) and for measurement error. Since sampling error varies directly with sample size, all studies are weighted by sample size Ni before correcting for the average attenuation factor (Schmidt and Hunter 1977).

Because measurement error data points are not always available for individual studies (see Appendix A), study correlations cannot be corrected individually for measurement error. Instead, correlations are meta-analysed using artefact distributions (for more details on artefact-distribution meta-analysis, see Hunter and Schmidt 1990). The moderator analyses use Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) subgrouping algorithm, as described in the Results section below.

Non-independence in any meta-analytic data set can present certain problems. Therefore, sensitivity analyses were conducted by using two other aggregation techniques. In the first sensitivity analysis, we used only one independent correlation per study, that is, composite scores. Furthermore, a second sensitivity analysis tested the stability of our transformations of effect sizes (reported t or d statistics into r).

observations is .18, with an observed variance of .06. The study artefacts of sampling and measurement error in CSP and CFP explain 24 percent of the cross-study variance of robs. After correction for sampling and measurement errors, the true score (corrected) correlation (ρ) was .36, which is twice the size of the observed correlation, with a variance (.19), which is slightly more than three times the size of the observed variance. As shown in the second line of Table 1, the relationship remains positive even after we removed studies that may be affected by response bias (survey measures of CFP) and halo (CSP reputation indices; Brown and Perry 1994); the remaining meta-analytic set showed an average observed correlation of .08 and a true-score correlation of .15. Although this true-score correlation is smaller than in the larger set including CSP reputation and CFP survey measures, it is not trivial. Thus, the meta-analytic findings support hypothesis H1.

The sensitivity analyses tend to confirm this conclusion. The first sensitivity analysis, which uses only one effect size per study (thus, k = 52, N = 4924), showed a mean observed correlation of .21 and a corrected correlation of .42. The second sensitivity analysis, on 210 product-moment correlations (k) with a total sample size of 22,218 observations (N), also showed slightly higher estimates (robs = .20, ρ = .41) than the overall meta-analysis reported in Table 1. Thus, in both ‘sensitivity’ meta-analyses (not reported in the tables), the mean observed and corrected correlations were positive and of similar magnitude as the correlations in the entire meta-analytic set. If anything, the sensitivity analyses suggest that our meta-analytic estimates are actually conservative estimates of the relationships between CSP and CFP.

# Corporate Social and Environmental Performance

Table 1 also shows analyses for two different conceptualizations of CSP. When the entire meta-analytic set was divided into two sets, that is, (a) those studies using a narrow definition of ‘social’ performance (thus excluding measures of environmental performance; k = 249, N = 24,055) and (b) studies of corporate environmental performance only (k = 139, N = 9823), the findings show that corporate environmental performance has a smaller relationship with CFP (robs = .06, ρ = .12) than do all other measures of CSP (robs = .23, ρ = .47), such as managerial principles and corporate reputations for minority hiring, for example. In the corporate environmental performance subset, the variances of observed and true-score correlations were also smaller than those in the ‘pure’ CSP subset. Furthermore, measurement error and sampling error explained more of the cross-study variance of robs in the corporate environmental performance subset than in the ‘pure’ CSP subset. Thus, the last two lines of Table 1 (entries 3.a and 3.b) demonstrate that the relatively lower correlation between corporate environmental performance and CFP is, in fact, much more consistent across industry and study contexts than the primary empirical studies would have us believe.

bias. Availability bias is one of the most common criticisms levelled against meta-analysis, in that critics of meta-analysis often suspect that published studies will report larger effect sizes than unpublished studies. File drawer analysis addresses this issue by computing the number of additional unlocated (that is, ‘lost’ or overlooked) studies needed to cause the correlation to decrease to a minimal critical level (r crit), which is set at .05 in this study. Hunter and Schmidt (1990) present the underlying assumptions and techniques of file drawer analysis. For each correlation computed in Tables 1–4, the results of the file drawer analysis are presented in the last column. As shown in Table 1, a very large number of studies (1,037) would be needed to change the overall substantive conclusions of this meta-analysis (entry 1 in Table 1).

# Temporal Sequence

Tables 2a and 2b show the results relevant to Hypothesis 2, which suggested a virtuous cycle between CSP and CFP. Consistent with that hypothesis, the primary studies supported the instrumental stakeholder and slack resources theories to about the same degree. Specifically, both the prior CFP and subsequent CFP subsets yielded observed correlations of .15, and corrected correlations of .29 (first two lines in Table 2a). Concurrent studies yielded observed and corrected correlations with CFP of .22 and .44, respectively (third line of Table 2a). Taken together, these findings suggest a virtuous cycle with quick cycle times or concurrent bidirectionality. However, the low percentages of observed cross-study variance explained by artefacts, ranging from 20 percent to 26 percent, and large true-score variances ranging from .17 to .19, indicate the presence of at least one moderator. As Table 2b shows, consistent with the overall analysis (Table 1, entries 3.a and 3.b), the results are stronger after corporate environmental measures were removed from CSP. Generally, though, the relationships reported in Table 2b confirm the conclusions of Table 2a.

# Mediator Variables: Learning and Reputation

To investigate Hypothesis 3, studies were divided into two broad subsets: (a) studies that correlated both internal and external measures of CSP with only accounting CFP measures (that is, measures of internal resource utilization, such as ROA or ROE); and (b) studies which correlated only externally visible measures of CSP, such as CSP reputation or disclosures, with exclusively external (for example, market return or sales growth) measures of CFP. The reputational argument is further subdivided into studies correlating external indicators of CFP with: (a) reputation indices of CSP; (b) CSP disclosures in annual reports and letters to shareholders; and (c) other externally visible measures of CSP such as social audits and charitable contributions.

Based on the magnitude of the meta-analytic correlations, the meta-analysed studies support the reputation-effects viewpoint relatively more strongly than the internal viewpoint, as shown in Table 3 (compare first two).

lines in Table 3, that is, entry 1 with entry 2). In addition, further hierarchical breakdown of the reputation view subset indicates that CSP disclosures appear to have a low reputational impact on CFP. This statistical conclusion is generalizable across study settings because a high proportion of variance (93 percent) is explained by study artefacts (entry 2.b in Table 3). Moreover, timing of measurement (temporal sequence) is not an important moderator within the ‘reputation view’ argument. As was the case in the overall meta-analysis, the correlations between CSP and subsequent CFP are almost identical to the ones found between CSP and prior CFP (ρ = .75 and .73, respectively; entries 2.a.1 and 2.a.2 in Table 3). Again, the correlations are highest when CSP and CFP were measured less than a year apart (ρ = .91, and 51 percent of cross-study variance explained by artefacts; entry 2.a.3).

# Moderator Analysis

The analyses relevant to Hypothesis 3 already alluded to an important feature of Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) meta-analytic technique; namely, detection of cross-study moderators. Because this algorithm will be used extensively in the remaining meta-analyses, a brief explanation seems in order. Hunter and Schmidt’s (1990) moderator analysis consists of two distinct methods. First, the ‘75% rule’ can be applied, stating that if 75 percent or more of the observed variance of correlations across studies is due to artefacts, then probably all of it is artefactual variance (on the grounds that the remaining 25 percent is likely due to artefacts not corrected for). Thus, in cases where 75 percent or more of the variance is explained by artefacts, including sampling error variance, moderators are unlikely to have caused a real variation in observed correlations (robs). This first method is able to detect the existence of unsuspected moderators.

The second method, which can detect discontinuous, theoretically predicted moderators, compares mean observed and true-score correlations across study domain subsets of the original entire set of studies aggregated in the meta-analysis. If in these meta-analytic subgroups, a higher percentage of variance is accounted for by study artefacts relative to the entire meta-analytic set, moderators are said to exist.

# Measurement Strategy as Moderator

To examine Hypotheses 4a and 4b, the entire data set of 388 correlations was broken down hierarchically to investigate the presence of moderator effects based on the operationalizations of CSP and CFP (see Table 4a). First, CFP and CSP operationalizations were disaggregated separately. Second, the four broad CSP operationalization subsets were broken down hierarchically into the two (or three, where available) CFP measurement categories. The lowest level in Table 4a is the only one that is not confounded by lack of standardized measurement and, thus, is the most informative.

In general, Table 4a indicates that the association between CSP and CFP depends on the firm’s or researcher’s operational definition of each construct, or both. Accounting measures were more highly correlated with CSP than.

Market-based measures (ρ = .42 as against .15; entries 1.b versus 1.a in Table 4a), and were particularly highly correlated with CSP reputation indices (ρ = .61; entry 2.b.2). In fact, overall the findings with respect to CSP operationalizations suggest that studies that used reputation indices as proxies for CSP showed the highest average correlation with CFP (ρ of .73 with a large variance of .19; entry 2.b in Table 4a). Of course, this high correlation may partially be due to halo (Brown and Perry 1994).

Furthermore, repeating the pattern of results testing reputation-theory effects (Table 3), disclosure measures appear to be only minimally related to CFP (robs = .04, ρ = .09, as shown in entry 2.a). This finding is generalizable because almost all the observed variance is explained by artefacts. Social audits, CSP processes, and outcomes are only modestly correlated with CFP (robs = .09, ρ = .18; entry 2.c). Similar mean correlations were found for the relationship between corporate social responsibility values or attitudes and CFP (robs = .10, ρ = .21; entry 2.d). The second level in the hierarchical breakdown supports the view that differences in previous findings resulted from study artefacts, stakeholder mismatching, other theoretical mis-specifications, or lack of theory (cf. also McWilliams and Siegel 2000). As discussed above, the overall percentage of cross-study variance (in robs) explained is 24 percent. In general, this percentage tends to increase in the measurement subgroups listed in Table 4a, which suggests that studies systematically differ with respect to the distortions caused by (previously uncorrected) statistical and methodological artefacts. The fact that artefacts account for 15 –100 percent of cross-study variance (the notorious ‘inconsistencies’ of this research stream) provides support for Hypothesis 4a.

The support for theoretical inconsistencies (stakeholder mismatching) becomes apparent by looking at some second-level hierarchical subgroups. First, the correlation of CSP disclosure measures with accounting CFP measures is slightly negative (ρ = –.02; entry 2.a.2). This small correlation supports the stakeholder mismatching thesis because there is no theoretical causal mechanism between CSP disclosures and internal (that is, accounting) CFP measures. Second, the observed and corrected correlations between (a) social audit and other observable or ‘objective’ (for example, dollar amount of charitable contributions) measures of CSP processes and (b) market-based measures of CFP are close to zero (Table 4a, entry 2.c.1), which again supports the stakeholder mismatching thesis. As Wood and Jones (1995: 242) argued earlier, ‘There is no theory to explain why stockholders would or would not prefer a company that gives one percent of pre-tax earnings to charity, that hires and develops minority or women workers, or that ranks higher in pollution control indices.’ In other words, the data suggest that capital market participants dismiss certain concrete behavioural measures of CSP (such as charitable donations), perhaps because they are perceived as direct attempts by firms to manage external impressions.

To examine the measurement moderators within subgroup 2.c even more closely, Table 4b shows results for social audits disaggregated from other CSP behaviours, which are further broken down.

# Orlitzky et al.: Corporate Social and Financial Performance

worthy. First, social audits were consistently, but only modestly, correlated with CFP (ρ = .23, 100 percent of cross-study variance explained). Second, across industry contexts, philanthropic donations were related with CFP at ρ = .29, which was higher than the respective correlation coefficients found for all other measures of CSP behaviours. However, the file drawer analyses (last column of Table 4b) suggest that some of the findings presented in Table 4b are not conclusive because a small number of additional studies could change our conclusions.

# Discussion

# Theoretical Implications

Based on this meta-analysis integrating 30 years of research, the answer to the introductory question posed by Business Week is affirmative. The results of this meta-analysis show that there is a positive association between CSP and CFP across industries and across study contexts. In that sense, we can confirm Frooman’s (1997) conclusions, based on event studies, supporting the validity of enlightened self-interest in the social responsibility arena. The data accumulated over the past 30 years do not support the latest contingency theory in the area of corporate social responsibility (McWilliams and Siegel 2001). Like earlier research reviews, McWilliams and Siegel (2001) take inconsistent findings in primary studies at face value (that is, ignore the possible impact of sampling error and measurement error) and explain the (apparent) inconsistency with a demand/supply model of corporate social responsibility. Moreover, the temporal analysis of our meta-analysis shows that the positive association between CFP and lagged CSP (slack resources argument) does not mask a weaker negative association between CSP and lagged CFP.

Can CSP be motivated by an ‘ecological selection process based on profit maximization or organizational survival’ (Wholey and Brittain 1986, in Husted 2000: 33)? Husted (2000: 34) agrees with the narrative reviews in this area, stating that it is ‘premature’ to conclude that adaptation to market and non-market environments might force organizations to consider social issues and CSP in their day-to-day strategizing. Our meta-analysis suggests the opposite. In fact, some of our observed correlations are higher than the correlations typically found between strategy-structure fit and CFP (Amburgey and Dacin 1994; Donaldson 1987). Despite those lower correlations, the strategy-structure-performance paradigm is firmly grounded on an economic survival mechanism (across industry contexts) analogous to Hypothesis 1. On the one hand, our meta-analysis contradicts Rowley and Berman’s (2000) suggestion that there cannot be a consistently positive relationship between CSP and CFP. On the other hand, in agreement with Rowley and Berman (2000), we demonstrate that the universally positive relationship varies (from highly positive to modestly positive) because of contingencies, such as reputation effects, market measures of CFP, or CSP disclosures.

# 24(3)

Traditionally, researchers have worried that any positive correlations are artefactual, due to halo effects (Brown and Perry 1994, 1995; Wood 1995). However, it is important to keep in mind that the only credible halo linkage would be from CFP to CSP; that is, companies that perform better financially receive higher CSP ratings, regardless of their true underlying CSP. The meta-analytic breakdown has shown that the potential halo effect (CFP → lagged CSP correlation) does not dominate a weaker CSP → lagged CFP correlation and distort results. In fact, the two correlations are identical at two digits (.29, see Table 2a). Also, when all potentially problematic studies are removed (that is, those that measure CSP reputations only and those that measure CFP with a survey instrument), the meta-analysis still shows a non-trivial positive ‘true-score’ correlation of .15 (see Table 1). Furthermore, the halo argument would suggest a much higher correlation between external (market) CFP and CSP reputation than between internal (accounting) CFP and CSP reputation. In fact, however, the correlations in both subgroups were similar (entries 2.b.1 versus 2.b.2 in Table 4a).

When the CFP survey measures and CSP reputation measures are removed, the cross-study variation of robs can be shown to be increasingly a function of the artefacts of sampling and measurement error (44 percent; see entry 2 in Table 1). Thus, many of the negative findings in individual studies are artefactual, so that the generalization of a positive CSP –CFP relationship applies more broadly than previously suggested (for example, Jones and Wicks 1999; Pava and Krausz 1995; Ullmann 1985; Wood and Jones 1995). We can, therefore, state with some confidence that the association between CSP and lagged CFP is not negative. Moreover, the causation seems to be that CSP and CFP mutually affect each other through a virtuous cycle: financially successful companies spend more because they can afford it, but CSP also helps them become a bit more successful. Moreover, the le drawer analysis indicates that the present findings cannot be dismissed by availability bias.

This meta-analysis both rejects and confirms notions developed by neo-classical economists. On the one hand, it rejects the idea that CSP is necessarily inconsistent with shareholder wealth maximization (Friedman 1970; Levitt 1958). Instead, organizational effectiveness may be a broad concept encompassing both financial and social performance (Andrews 1987; Judge 1994). It is also worth noting that, according to most credible versions of stakeholder theory, shareholders are legitimate stakeholders. On the other hand, our findings also confirm the notions of libertarians such as Friedman that government regulation in the area of CSP may not be necessary. If the statistical relationship between CSP and CFP were negative, bottom-line considerations might constitute barriers to outcomes desired by the public, which in turn would make government intervention, which serves the public ‘interest’, a necessity. Yet, with CSP, the case for regulation and social control by governments (acting on behalf of ‘society’ or ‘the public’) is relatively weak because organizations and their shareholders tend to benefit from managers’ prudent analysis, evaluation, and balancing of multiple constituents’ preferences. Therefore, these actions are most likely adopted.

voluntarily, based on managers’ cost-benefit analyses of a firm’s investments. In contrast, ‘socially responsible’ command-and-control regulation may prescribe inflexible means–ends chains that are inappropriate for a particular firm’s non-market and market environments (Majumdar and Marcus 2001).

# Implications for Future Research

The meta-analysis helps to identify areas in which there have been relatively few studies conducted, and which warrant more research (for example, social responsibility values and market CFP; see Table 4a). Additionally, the analysis shows areas in which the unexplained variance across studies remains relatively large, so that further inquiry is needed to identify moderators (for example, CSP reputation measures and market-based CFP; see Table 4a).

Moreover, Appendix A shows that the field must make a concerted effort to improve the reliability of CSP and CFP measures. In several subgroups, the percentage of variance of r obs explained by measurement error (that is, low reliability) was substantial. In addition to psychometric refinements, CSP researchers must decide whether CSP ‘processes’ should really be regarded as a social performance measure. Including processes is equivalent to acknowledging effort. More broadly, some readers may share the authors’ concern that previous studies were over-inclusive with respect to definitions of stakeholders and, thus, the CSP proxies (cf. also Roman et al. 1999). We would argue that in future studies, only social and environmental performance ‘outcomes’ should count as CSP and that the concept of ‘stakeholder’ must be more restrictive than it currently is.

Another concern that may be raised concerns the different variable CSP measures. This issue needs to be examined in future theoretical and empirical work. We believe that CSP, like CFP, is a valid theoretical construct — admittedly a meta-construct — which can be measured in a variety of ways. Like Meyer and Gupta (1994), we see the possible independence of the operationalizations as a natural outcome of differences in organizational strategies, structures, and environments. Moreover, we share the view of many meta-analysts (for example, Cooper 1989; Dalton et al. 1999; Hunter and Schmidt 1990; Smith and Glass 1977) that broad constructs can, and should, be operationalized in a number of ways. As long as researchers’ choices of CSP (and CFP) measures are informed by prior judgments of their theoretical meaningfulness and subjected to peer review, then relatively low correlations across measurement categories do not present an obstacle to research integration. More important to the present case, however, is that our review of CSP generalizability coefficients shows that different CSP measures are, in fact, rather highly correlated (average rxx = .71; Appendix A). In other words, conceptual speculations about the impossibility of meaningful integration of prior research are not supported by empirical evidence (for a detailed review of this topic, cf. Orlitzky 1998).

Overall, we reach very different conclusions than Margolis and Walsh (2001). Although we agree with some of their more definitive conclusions as to a positive CSP–CFP relationship, we also argue that our data analysis.

# Organization Studies

# 24(3)

shows that interesting questions remain. The research effort does not have to be abandoned because of poor theory or poor methods in this line of inquiry. We are particularly concerned with the conclusions of Margolis and Walsh (2001) because their criticism of other studies is argued from the vantage point of a method (the ‘vote-counting’ literature review) whose lack of validity has been known for more than 20 years (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter and Schmidt 1990). First, they do not take into account sampling and measurement errors. Moreover, their review relies on a binary world-view, which holds that a relationship between CSP and CFP either exists (if results are statistically positive, or negative) or does not exist (if results are mixed or statistically non-significant, which they falsely call ‘zero’ effects (cf. Cohen 1990, 1994)). The relationship between business and society is too important theoretically to base our conclusions on methodologically ill-advised research reviews.

# Implications for Managers

Despite previous assumptions of inconclusive findings (for example, Jones and Wicks 1999; McWilliams and Siegel 2001; Roman et al. 1999; Ullmann 1985; Wood and Jones 1995), we can legitimately derive implications for corporate strategy from the meta-analysis. First and foremost, market forces generally do not penalize companies that are high in corporate social performance; thus, managers can afford to be socially responsible. If managers believe that CSP is an antecedent of CFP, they may eventually actively pursue CSP because they think the market will reward them for doing so. Top managers must learn to use CSP as a reputational lever (ρ= .73) and be attentive to the perceptions of third parties, regardless of whether they are market analysts, public interest groups, or the media. Whereas social audits in and of themselves are only moderately beneficial (ρ = .23), a company that is high in CSP may especially benefit from receiving public endorsement from federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency or Occupational Safety and Health Administration. As Fombrun (1996) suggested, the key to reaping benefits from CSP is a return from reputation (cf. also Roberts and Dowling 2002).

As findings about the positive relationships between CSP and CFP become more widely known, managers may be more likely to pursue CSP as part of their strategy for attaining high CFP. These strategic management considerations would be consistent with Baron’s (2000) managerial approach to the business–society interface. Baron (2000) argues that successful executives are able to integrate market strategies with non-market strategies in order to position their firm for optimal effectiveness. Baron’s (2000) book offers guidelines as to how firms can strategically achieve this integration in a number of areas (such as the news media, activists, social movements, legislatures, ethics, and so on). Alternatively, social performance may increase through less deliberate decision processes, as firms emulate others that are experiencing high financial success (DiMaggio and Powell 1983). Either evolutionary process would reduce the importance of coercive control.

mechanisms (in the form of government regulations) for effecting public welfare and ecological sustainability. If the mental models of managers and regulators moved to this more libertarian framework, the primary role of regulations would be their signalling function with respect to prioritizing certain issues and certain constituents’ claims over others.

# Conclusion

Theoretically, portraying managers’ choices with respect to CSP and CFP as an either/or trade-off is not justified in light of 30 years of empirical data. This meta-analysis has shown that (1) across studies, CSP is positively correlated with CFP, (2) the relationship tends to be bidirectional and simultaneous, (3) reputation appears to be an important mediator of the relationship, and (4) stakeholder mismatching, sampling error, and measurement error can explain between 15 percent and 100 percent of the cross-study variation in various subsets of CSP–CFP correlations. Corporate virtue in the form of social and, to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility is rewarding in more ways than one.

# Abstract

The purpose of this study is to analyze the connection between the sustainability performance and financial performance of Bangladeshi banks to explore the impact of the Bangladesh Environmental Risk Management Guideline. We analyzed all 56 scheduled commercial banks that are currently operating in Bangladesh under the guidelines of the Central Bank of Bangladesh. Data for the sample has been collected from publicly available reports such as annual, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, disclosed sustainability and financial information on the banks’ websites, including all bank branches, and data published from the Central Bank. Data has been analyzed using panel regression. Our results indicate that higher sustainability performance creates a higher financial performance, and that bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks. The analysis did not find, however, that higher financial performance influences the sustainability performance of the banks positively. Consequently, this research contributes to the research on legitimacy-driven behavior of Bangladeshi banks. This behavior rather leads to a reactive adoption of sustainability activities instead of proactive behavior.

# 1. Introduction

Recently, there has been an increasing number of calls for a more sustainable financial industry [1] that even motivated the Financial Stability Board of the G20 to establish a Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosure [2]. With the economic rise of many Asian countries, integrating sustainable finance into the financial industry of these countries is important to address environmental and social issues, such as environmental pollution [3] and inequality [4]. To address both organizational ethics and financial sector stability, several countries, among them China and Bangladesh, introduced financial industry sustainability policies in addition to voluntary codes of conduct implemented by the industry. These countries experience severe environmental issues, such as air and water pollution, that have significant effects on their population and therefore try to decrease lending to and investing in polluting industries as well as to increase financing of more environmentally friendly industries. Bangladesh Bank, for instance, introduced the Environmental Risk Management Guidelines (ERM) in 2011 [5] to engage the financial sector in green finance.

As financial sector sustainability regulations are relatively new, there is a lack of research about the effect of these policies on both the financial and the sustainability performance of the regulated industries. Furthermore, there is a gap in the knowledge about the connection between sustainability performance and the financial performance of banks in countries with such policies. Most of the studies published so far address the Chinese Green Credit Policy [6–10]. Those studies found a positive effect of green banking activities, such as green lending and the financial performance of the financial sector.

institutions. Studies addressing a South Asian country such as Bangladesh are sparse, and their results are controversial. However, they agree that sustainable banking, including corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting, is in an early phase in Bangladesh [11–15].

Though ERM has been introduced in 2011, only a few banks in Bangladesh even adopted green banking guidelines at this time [16]. However, Ahmed and Ahmed [17], for instance, found that the sustainability performance of Bangladeshi banks has increased since then. Nevertheless, they did not find a correlation between their environmental and financial performance. Other studies that addressed the lending business, however, found that integrating sustainability criteria into the lending business decreases the number of default loans and consequently has a positive impact on a lender’s financial performance [18]. Despite some research on sustainability in Bangladeshi banks, the question remains whether regulatory sustainability guidelines improve both the environmental and financial performance of the regulated banks.

We use legitimacy theory [19, 20] to explain why and how Bangladeshi banks adopt sustainability strategies and what the consequences are for their financial performance. The theory states that banks will adopt environmental regulations and increase their sustainability performance if there is outside pressure. Furthermore, the theory claims that external pressure is stronger for bigger banks than smaller banks. Finally, according to the theory, adopting guidelines because of legitimacy concerns will not lead to integration into the banks’ strategies. Consequently, our three research questions are whether higher sustainability performance increases financial performance, whether better financial performance leads to higher sustainability performance, and whether bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks.

To respond to the research questions, we analyzed all 56 regulated Bangladeshi banks between 2012 and 2016 based on their annual reports, CSR, or similar reports and on the information from their websites. In line with a study that addressed a similar question in China [8], an indicator system that consists of social and environmental sustainability indicators has been used to calculate a sustainability score (SS) for the banks. The score has been used as the independent variable to predict the financial performance of the banks as well as the dependent variable based on a lagged panel regression and Granger causality calculation [21].

The results of the study demonstrate that higher sustainability performance creates higher financial performance. However, the analysis did not find that higher financial performance influences the sustainability performance of the banks positively. Finally, we could show that bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks.

Following legitimacy theory, we conclude that the analyzed banks are rather reactive concerning their sustainability strategy and that they mainly respond to the institutional pressure of Bangladesh Bank because of legitimacy purposes. Instead of integrating sustainability aspects into their core business to decrease risks and to increase the opportunities of green banking, and consequently increase their financial performance, banks rather react in a stakeholder-oriented fashion to keep their legitimacy. Consistent with legitimacy theory, they are biased towards activities favorable to stakeholders instead of a strategic sustainability approach.

The study contributes to legitimacy theory in sustainable banking and its financial consequences. It demonstrates that increased sustainability performance has a positive effect on the financial performance of banks, as intended by Bangladesh Bank’s ERM, but that this information is not integrated into the banks’ business strategies. Furthermore, the research contributes to legitimacy theory by adding knowledge about the legitimacy-driven behavior of South Asian banks. Moreover, our results contribute to theory by suggesting that legitimacy-driven behavior might not lead to strategic corporate sustainability that addresses the main societal issues in a proactive way.

The remainder of the paper describes the background literature and the theory, followed by the presentation of the sample and methods. Finally, we report the results of the study and finish with a discussion and conclusions.

# 2. Background

Several studies have analyzed financial sustainability regulations and their impact on regulated banks. Most of these studies explore the impact of the Chinese Green Credit Guidelines. Some studies, however, also examine Bangladeshi banks with regard to their sustainability. In general, however, studies on this topic in South Asia are sparse. The following sections present an overview of empirical findings on banks and sustainability, financial sector sustainability regulations and policies, as well as theoretical findings on financial sector sustainability regulations and sustainability in banking.

Banks started integrating non-financial environmental and social aspects into their business during the 1980s. Firstly, they addressed internal environmental management [22], resulting in water, energy, and materials savings, as well as in lower emissions and high reputation [23]. As the second step, banks integrated environmental issues into lending, investing, asset management, and project finance [24]. Hence, they became CSR intermediaries [25] that influence the CSR of their clients, because higher corporate social performance (CSP) mitigates borrowers’ financial risks [26]. Consequently, voluntary sustainability codes of conduct, such as the United Nations Environmental Program Financial Initiative (UNEPFI), the UN Principles for Responsible Investing (UNPRI), and the Equator Principles have been instigated [27].

Sustainability risks, such as those caused by climate change or negative environmental impacts of commercial borrowers or investees, have a significant influence on the financial risk of credit and investment portfolios. Consequently, they have to be managed thoroughly [7, 28]. Therefore, many banks have implemented sustainable credit risk assessment procedures [29] and have been using environmental, social, and governance criteria to conduct responsible investments [30 – 32]. Some studies, however, suggest that the sustainability strategies of many banks are not substantially addressing their core business and the main societal issues [33].

For a long time, the pressure on the financial sector to perform well concerning the sustainability impact of their main products and services, such as lending and investing, has been lower than in many other industries (Weber et al., 2014). Studies have found, however, that environmental and sustainability reporting positively correlates with the size and the profitability of financial institutions [14, 34, 35]. Furthermore, the integration of environmental and sustainability issues into financial sector products and services has been increasing over time and has positive effects on the banks’ financial performance (Scholtens, 2008a).

Consequently, one of the motivations for integrating sustainability into the banking business is the correlation with the financial performance of banks. Igbudu and Garanti [36] suggest that sustainable banking increases the banks’ loyalty and corporate reputation, while a study in Germany identified a strong growth potential for social banking [37] and, therefore, a new market to tap into. Furthermore, studies found a positive connection between corporate social responsibility and financial performance in the banking sector [38, 39], between sustainability, measured by the membership in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), and efficiency [40], as well as between responsible investing and financial returns [41, 42]. However, Climent [43] found that ethical banks are less profitable than their conventional counterparts but that they have more substantial growth in their lending business.

Additionally, several studies suggest that banks are rather reactive and defensive concerning the incorporation of sustainability aspects into their core businesses [44, 45]. Many of them focus on short-term results and do not integrate sustainability into their core business [46]. The need for a sustainability culture [47] to develop capabilities and to provide resources to improve corporate sustainability performance, however, is not only a phenomenon in the financial industry but in all sectors [48 – 51]. Consequently, financial sector sustainability regulations should take into account that banks might not have the necessary capabilities and resources to implement the regulations efficiently in a way that increases their financial performance.

Though heavily regulated compared with other industrial sectors, the financial sector’s exposure to institutional pressure and regulations addressing sustainability [52], environmental, and societal risks [53, 54] is relatively small. Financial sector regulations focus mainly on risk-adjusted.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

financial capital provisions, financial risks, and guaranteeing the stability of the financial industry. Newer approaches, however, also address the impact of the financial sector on sustainable development and risks for the stability of the financial industry caused by sustainability risks, such as climate change [55]. Mainly, regulations and policies addressing the impact of climate change on the financial sector are discussed, for instance, by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures [56], but also in academia [57].

Financial sector sustainability regulations are implemented mainly for two reasons: (1) to increase green lending and investment and (2) to enhance the financial sector’s financial stability [7, 18, 58]. The financial sector sustainability regulation that is most frequently discussed in academic publications is the Chinese Green Credit Policy, introduced by the China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2012 [6]. Whether the Chinese regulation has achieved its goals is controversial. Zhao and Xu [59] state that the Green Credit Policy will increase green lending and consequently contribute to sustainable development. Additionally, studies that analyzed the sustainability performance of Chinese banks found that banks with a higher green lending ratio and higher sustainability performance are exposed to lower risks [7–9]. Jiguang and Zhiqun [60] are more critical and claim that additional regulations and internationalization is needed to promote green finance, particularly carbon finance. Similarly, another study asks for better implementation mechanisms to guarantee the success of the green credit policy [10]. A study that addresses financial industry sustainability regulations in South America from a macro perspective, however, found a positive effect of these regulations on the financial stability of the financial industry [58].

The need to increase capabilities to become more sustainable, even in the presence of regulations, is emphasized by two studies. They suggest that environmental risk management practices have to be improved to avoid a trade-off between the sustainability performance of banks and their financial performance [61, 62].

A study that addresses the implementation problem in Bangladesh came to a similar conclusion. Though there is a potential for sustainable banking to have positive effects on banks’ financial performance, the necessary capabilities for sustainable banking, such as sustainable credit rating expertise and systems, are often missing [18]. Additionally, a study analyzing the situation in India suggests that the public sector banking industry addresses sustainability in a defensive and preventive way. The research indicates that banks adopt the regulatory norms but are not pro-active in addressing sustainable development in their business [45].

Positive impacts of sustainable banking on sustainable development, however, have been identified in a study analyzing Nigerian banks [63]. Similar to banks in China and Bangladesh, Nigerian banks are regulated through a sustainable banking policy overseen by the domestic banking regulator [55]. Hence, such regulations might change banks toward a direction where they contribute to sustainable development and reduce their financing of unsustainable businesses and projects [64].

Bangladesh Bank introduced the Environmental Risk Management (ERM) Guidelines for Banks and Financial Institutions in Bangladesh in 2011 [5]. Their goal is to incentivize banks to integrate environmental and social criteria into their credit risk management procedures and consequently to improve the environmental and social standards in Bangladesh’s industries. ERM introduced guidelines and tools to improve the sustainability assessment as well as refinancing schemes for environmentally sustainable projects [18]. Consequently, if adopted, the policy should influence the environmental sustainability performance of Bangladeshi banks. Several studies assessing the corporate sustainability performance of Bangladesh companies and banks, however, suggest that corporate sustainability and corporate sustainability reporting is on a low level compared to other countries.

One of the earliest studies, as well as newer research on corporate sustainability reporting in Bangladesh, state that both the quantity and the quality of environmental disclosures are poor compared to those in many other countries [34, 65], though many stakeholders in Bangladesh ask for transparent corporate reporting [66]. The reasons for the lack of disclosure are a shortage of resources, the exclusive

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

focus on profit, lack of legal requirements, lack of awareness and capacity, poor sustainability performance, and the fear of bad publicity [67]. Additionally, studies on the sustainability reporting of Bangladeshi banks echo these results [12]. Khan and Islam [13], for instance, found that only a few Bangladeshi banks address all the criteria proposed by the Global Reporting Initiative. For example, only a few banks conduct environmental disclosure [68]. A reason for these results might be low stakeholder pressure, particularly from the general public [15]. Since 2010, however, funds allocated to green banking are increasing in Bangladesh, though the absolute value is still low [11]. Finally, public commercial banks in Bangladesh adopted the ERM guideline and increased their green lending [16] as well as their sustainability activities [69]. To close the gap in the literature about the adoption of green banking regulations in South Asia, the objective of our study is to analyze the sustainability performance of Bangladeshi banks, the connection between their sustainability performance and financial performance, and the influence of the banks’ size and their sustainability performance.

# 3. Theory

The study is based on legitimacy theory [20]. In line with Suchman, we define legitimacy as a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of Bangladeshi banks are appropriate within the norms created by the regulator Bangladesh Bank. Related research found that legitimacy-based sustainability activities of firms are reactions to external pressure [70]. The emphasis here lies on reactive, meaning that corporations do not engage in sustainability activities as a proactive way to increase their business performance but as a reaction to stakeholder pressure or events. Consequently, activities decrease when pressure decreases [71].

Another implication based on legitimacy theory is that bigger institutions are more exposed to public pressure and therefore react more strongly [72]. In our study, we assume that bigger banks are more exposed to the influence of the public, including the regulator. Consequently, they conduct sustainability activities because of self-interest and normative approval [20]. Finally, in line with legitimacy theory, we hypothesize that banks report more about the environment than about social issues because the ERM mainly addresses environmental sustainability.

Sustainability activities triggered by legitimacy concerns, however, are not stable and do not address the core strategies and activities of banks but try to satisfy stakeholders. Therefore, we hypothesize that banks do not increase their sustainability activities even if they were able to improve their financial performance because of their sustainability activities. Hence, they do not follow a strategic corporate sustainability approach [73].

To summarize, our main hypotheses are (1) that Bangladeshi banks are reactive with regard to their sustainability activities, (2) that bigger banks perform a stronger reaction than smaller banks, (3) that Bangladeshi banks mainly focus on the environmental aspect of sustainability, and (4) that the financial success of sustainability activities does not lead to increased activities in the following year.

# 4. Materials and Methods

We analyzed all 56 scheduled commercial banks that are operating under the guidelines of the Central Bank of Bangladesh. Data for the sample was collected from publicly available reports, such as annual, sustainability, and CSR reports, disclosed sustainability and financial information on the banks’ websites, including all bank branches, as well as data published by the Bangladesh Bank. We conducted a document analysis using NVIVO software. The keywords are in line with similar studies [8,24] and are based on the criteria of the Global Reporting Initiative [74–76].

The sample consists of four types of banks, state-owned commercial banks (SOB), specialized development banks (SDB), private commercial banks (PCB), and foreign commercial banks (FCB) (see Table 1). Data was collected for the years between 2012 and 2016. The year 2016 was the year we found full disclosure for all banks in the sample at the time of gathering the data. The first year is the

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

year of the implementation of the ERM guides. Only 22 out of the 56 banks, however, have published any information related to environmental, social, and sustainability aspects.

Financial data was gathered from the banks’ annual reports. We used total assets (TA), net profit after tax (NPAT), return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE) as key financial accounting indicators. In line with [19], TA was used to measure the size of the banks. The other indicators have been used by similar studies that address the link between sustainability performance and financial performance in the banking sector (see, for instance, [7,8,38,77]).

The analysis of the sustainability performance was conducted in line with earlier studies that analyzed the sustainability performance of banks [8]. It is based on the framework of the Global Reporting Initiative [74]. The analysis assessed the presence of strategies, activities, products, and services in the categories of social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services. The latter were assessed because they are addressed by the ERM. If an indicator was mentioned, a bank achieved a value 1 for the indicator. Otherwise, it achieved the value 0.

To analyze Granger causality [21], we used panel regression models with one-year lags for sustainability performance and financial performance, respectively. As the Hausman test [78] was significant, we used fixed-effects models. To control for accuracy of the regression, we used bootstrapping [79].

# 5. Results

We start by presenting the major financial and sustainability indicators of the banks in the sample, split by banking types (see Table 2). In line with Bangladesh Bank, we distinguished between conventional commercial banks, foreign commercial banks, Islamic banks, specialized banks, and state-owned commercial banks.

The three categories, social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services, were tested for homogeneity using Cronbach’s alpha [80]. All three categories achieved a value higher than 0.8, with αsocial = 0.87, αenvironment = 0.87, and αgreen = 0.85. Consequently, based on the disclosure of the indicators, a sustainability score was calculated for each bank. First, we calculated the sum of the values for environmental, social, and green indicators. Then, the banks’ results were divided by the maximum achievable value to standardize the values for the banks’ performance in the respective category. Lastly, a sustainability score (SS) was calculated using the average of the environmental, social, and green scores. As a result, SS is an equally weighted combination of the environmental, social, and green products and services scores. The descriptive statistics of the categories and SS are presented in Table 4.

# Test Statistics

To control for differences between government banks and other banks as well as between domestic banks and international banks, we conducted t-tests with SS as the dependent variable. We found a statistically significant difference between domestic and international banks with regard to their SS performance (df = 278, t = 3.274, p = 0.001). Domestic banks performed better with regard to the sustainability score than international banks (𝑥domestic = 0.435, 𝑥international = 0.338). The t-test for government-owned banks and other banks did not result in a statistically significant difference between these two groups (df = 278, t = −1.097, p = 0.274).

Secondly, we tested the difference between the three categories: social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services. The results of the Hotelling Test [82] indicate a significant difference between the three categories (T2 = 1871, F = 619.2, p < 0.0001). Environmental sustainability achieves the highest average, with social sustainability as the second-highest category, followed by green products and services (𝑥environment = 0.61, 𝑥social = 0.41, 𝑥green products = 0.24).

As the next step, we analyzed the change in the sustainability performance SS as well as of the three sustainability sub-groups over time, as we assumed that the introduction of the ERM created a change with regard to the banks’ sustainability performance. The change over time is presented in Figure 1, suggesting a slight increase in all three sustainability fields over time.

|2014|0.2|
|2015|0.3|
|2016|0.4|

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

We tested the increase of the sustainability performance over time using an ANOVA for repeated measurement with the year and the banks as factors and the sustainability score as the dependent variable. The results of the ANOVA show that the change of the sustainability score over time is significant (F = 24.86, df = 4, p < 0.0001) and that there is a significant difference in the sustainability score between the banks (F = 12.83, df = 55, p < 0.0001). Additionally, the full model is significant (F = 13.65, df = 59, p < 0.0001) and explains 79 percent of the total variance.

In addition, Figure 1 shows that the development over time is very similar for all three categories. As tested above, the environmental sustainability category has the highest value before social sustainability and green products and services.

As the next step, we conducted a fixed-effects panel regression (see above for the Haussman test indicating fixed effects). The financial indicators and the sustainability score were used as independent and time-lagged dependent variables, respectively, to analyze cause and effect between the sustainability score and the financial performance using Granger causality (see Table 5). To control for accuracy, we used bootstrapping with 50 replications. The results of the one-year time lags are presented in Table 6. Two- and three-year time lags did not suggest different results but are based on fewer data.

| |Sustainability Score|ROE|−0.004|0.099|0.712|
| |ROE|Sustainability Score|2.13|0.20|0.0130|

The results show significant regressions for SS predicting the lagged financial indicators. The higher SS, the higher the financial indicators of the banks. The coefficients are positive and significant. Concerning the ability of the financial indicators to predict SS, only total assets, the indicator for the size of the banks, can predict the sustainability performance of a bank. There are no significant regressions for the other financial indicators as independent variables. Hence, the sustainability indicator is able to predict the financial performance, but financial indicators are not able to predict the sustainability performance of banks.

To test these findings for robustness, we used bootstrapping with 50 repetitions [79] and added the bank type as specified in Table 1 to the panel regressions. The results are presented in Table 7.

The results presented in Table 7 indicate that the regression is robust. The same regression is significant after 50 bootstrapping repetitions. Furthermore, we did not find significant impacts of the type of bank on the prediction of the financial or the sustainability performance. The only significant coefficient for the type of bank is for the prediction of the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio, because state-owned bank have a higher NPL ratio than other banks.

# 6. Discussion

This study analyzed the connection between sustainability performance and the financial performance of Bangladeshi banks. We used panel regressions with one-year time lags and both financial indicators and a sustainability score SS as dependent and independent lagged variables, respectively. The analysis of all scheduled commercial banks in Bangladesh found that a higher SS performance leads to better financial performance one year later. However, the study also suggests that better financial performance does not lead to higher sustainability performance in the following year. The results shine a light on organizational ethics and sustainability in the Bangladeshi banking industry.

Concerning the type of sustainability performance, our results indicate that all three, social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services, have been increasing in parallel over time. Environmental sustainability and green products and services, however, are not growing stronger than social sustainability, as could have been expected after the introduction of the ERM guidelines. Finally, we found that bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks.

The following sections will discuss the results based on legitimacy theory [20]. According to this theory, the banks in our sample should react to institutional pressure reactively. They do not engage in sustainability activities proactively as would be predicted by strategic CSR [73].

The institutional pressure conducted through the ERM guidelines drives Bangladeshi banks to become more sustainable. They want to take the opportunity of the lower-cost capital provision by Bangladesh Bank and wish to avoid the adverse effects on their legitimacy of not reacting to the.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

guidelines. This reaction increases the banks’ sustainability performance and finally improves their financial performance, as found in many other studies [8,38].

The somewhat surprising result that increased financial performance does not improve sustainability performance can also be interpreted based on legitimacy theory. The banks in the sample react to outside factors and perform socially desired sustainability activities in return for approval of their business activities. However, they do not strategically internalize sustainability. If they did, the additional financial returns would lead to increased sustainability activities in the following year. In our study, however, we only found an impact of the sustainability performance on the lagged financial performance and not the other way around as, for instance, Waddock and Graves [83] report.

We also found a strong connection between the size of the banks, measured by their total assets, and their sustainability performance. This result is also in line with the legitimacy theory [19, 20], stating that bigger organizations are more exposed to public pressure and therefore invest more in their reputation [84] and stakeholder relations [85]. Additionally, Alberici and Querci [35] found that the quality of environmental activities of finance organizations increases with their size.

Similar to Islam and Kokubu [85], we found a general increase in all three types of sustainability activities. Again, legitimacy-based activities are rather reactive and general instead of addressing particular business activities and trying to improve their sustainability performance. Instead, the Bangladeshi banks address prevailing societal norms asking for corporate sustainability in general instead of specific actions that are connected to the banks’ business. Therefore, we also found only a few banks that have implemented green financial products and services.

Concerning organizational ethics and sustainability in South Asia, the results suggest that regulatorily induced sustainability activities have a positive effect on Bangladeshi banks. Some studies in other world regions came to similar conclusions, for instance, in China [7, 86], but also in North America and Europe [87]. The missing connection between financial performance and sustainability performance at a later stage, however, seems to be specific for the Bangladesh sample. Waddock and Graves [83] established this connection and explained it with the institutional impact on both corporate sustainability performance and financial performance. Furthermore, they explain the positive impact of the sustainability performance on financial performance with the good management theory [88, 89]. Hence, it seems that sustainability is not a part of good management in Bangladeshi banks yet and that the banks in the sample do not realize that they can create additional value through sustainability approaches [90].

Another interesting issue related to corporate sustainability in South Asia is that environmental sustainability is more often mentioned by the banks in the sample than social sustainability. However, topics such as inclusion and equality are a top priority in many South Asian countries [4, 91]. The latter includes stakeholder engagement, community building, social inclusion, and so on. These issues should be at the core of sustainable banking in Bangladesh and other South Asian countries. However, an earlier study by Khan and Islam [13] suggests a similar result. Hence, it looks like there has not been much change in addressing social sustainability issues. As expected, the Bangladesh ERM did not improve this situation but only influenced the environmental performance of the banks. As Bangladeshi banks seem to have reputational motivations to integrate sustainability into their business, regulations addressing social sustainability might lead to an improvement in this regard.

Overall, it looks like the Bangladeshi banking sector has been increasing its sustainability performance between 2012 and 2016. One reason for this development might be the ERM that has been introduced in 2012. Because of the correlation between sustainability performance and financial performance, it not only contributes to improving the industry’s environmental and social performance, but also to its financial performance. This finding is in line with the goals of the ERM and other financial industry sustainability regulations, such as the Chinese Green Credit Policy [7–10]. However, to increase the influence of the banking industry on sustainable development, a more long-term sustainability orientation is needed [92] that is supported by investments in sustainability performance.

# 7. Conclusions

The results of our study contribute to legitimacy theory by showing that legitimacy is not only a driver for CSR reporting but also for CSR-related activities. The banks in our sample have implemented some sustainability activities because external stakeholders expect this behavior. However, the activities are reactive and not firmly connected to the banks’ businesses. Green financial products and services, for instance, are not growing more than general social and environmental sustainability activities.

Our practical contribution addresses strategic sustainability in banking. The results suggest that banks should not only follow sustainability regulations but that they need to develop a strategy to benefit from the sustainable business approach. With regards to regulators, our results suggest that they should also offer training and tools to enable banks to build the necessary capacity to implement sustainability into their businesses.

Our research was limited with regard to data gathering. We only used publicly available data. Future research might use data from the banks that is gathered through interviews, portfolio analyses, as well as product and services analyses. Furthermore, the impacts of the sustainability performance on the environment and society should be analyzed in future research to explore the sustainability effects of financial sustainability regulations. This analysis should be done from a stakeholder perspective.

Increasing evidence suggests that corporate sustainability is paradoxical in nature, as corporates and managers have to achieve economic, social, and environmental goals, simultaneously. While a paradox perspective has been broadly incorporated into sustainability research for more than a decade, it has resulted in limited improvement in our understanding of corporate sustainability paradox management. In this study, the authors conduct a systematic review of the literature of corporate sustainability paradox management by adopting the Smith–Lewis three-stage model of dynamic equilibrium. The results reveal the following:

1. Both environmental and cognitive factors manifest tensions arising from the sustainability paradox.
2. While both proactive and defensive strategies are adopted to manage the tensions embedded in the corporate sustainability, the proactive strategy is more extensively studied in the current literature.
3. Management strategies of corporate sustainability paradox are characterized as multi-level, multi-stage, and dealing with multiple paradoxes.
4. Proactive strategies enable organizations to enjoy short-term and long-term sustainability benefits.

The authors call for further research explicitly addressing the following areas:

1. the paradoxical nature of corporate sustainability management;
2. corporate sustainability paradox management of for-profit organizations;
3. the micro-foundations of corporate sustainability paradox management;
4. defensive strategies and new proactive strategies; and
5. a unified standard of sustainability outcomes.

The practical implications of this review are then elaborated. In practice, the results imply that organizations would best manage the corporate sustainability paradox by understanding the paradox and its equilibrium stages. This review and proposed research agenda are expected to deepen interdisciplinary knowledge and set the stage for interested scholars to undertake in their future inquiries.

# INTRODUCTION

Although organizations have been pursuing their economic goals as primary interests for a long time, concerns about the natural environment and social welfare have become essential for organizations to deal with when considering sustainable development (Gladwin et al., 1995; Bansal, 2002; Zollo et al., 2013). Corporate sustainability juxtaposes economic, social, and environmental.

goals in parallel (Bansal, 2005; Schaltegger et al., 2016) to achieve overall social welfare (Schwartz and Carroll, 2008). Organizations that proactively take up their social responsibility display impressive competitiveness and vitality (Thiel, 2017; Ivory and Brooks, 2018; Daddi et al., 2019). Meanwhile, socially or environmentally irresponsible behavior still commonly occurs, even though it hurts the companies’ image and reputation (Lin-Hi and Müller, 2013). While it is challenging to engage simultaneously with economic, social, and environmental goals, it is critical to consider how organizations and managers can successfully manage these multiple goals is critical to gain long-term competitiveness.

Three theoretical perspectives have emerged to address the relationships among economic, social, and environmental responsibilities: business frame, win–win, and business case perspectives. The business frame perspective from earlier scholarly work proposes that pursuing profit goals is an organization’s primary responsibility and criticizes other pursuits as insignificant, as these essentially contradict an organization’s economic benefit (Friedman, 1970). Corporate sustainability scholars have almost abandoned such a view, as it assumes a narrow scope of corporate responsibility and ignores the social and environmental aspects of corporations’ operations (Wood, 1991; Hahn and Figge, 2011; Barnett, 2019). By contrast, the win–win perspective argues that both economic and social missions are attainable at the same time (Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015). However, this view overemphasizes their reciprocity or interdependence and ignores the tensions from conflicts between these missions (Turban and Greening, 1997; Albinger and Freeman, 2000; Wagner, 2010), and the trade-offs between specific stakeholder groups are not always avoidable (Bridoux et al., 2016). Meanwhile, the business case frame regards these conflicts as being canceled out, by advocating the instrumental utilization of social pursuits to advance economic aims (Hahn et al., 2015; Hafenbrädl and Waeger, 2017); however, the business case frame has been criticized as insufficient to depict the true notion of corporate sustainability (Dyllick and Hockerts, 2002; Hahn and Figge, 2011), resulting in opportunism and a lack of intrinsic motivation for corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement (Nijhof and Jeurissen, 2010).

In this study, the authors attempt to adopt a fourth perspective, the paradox perspective, to review how previous organizational sustainability research has deepened knowledge, echoing Margolis and Walsh’s (2003) call for intricate theorization. The paradox perspective, building on the recent advancement of organizational paradox theory, posits that organizations are rife with persistent, contradictory, yet mutually interdependent demands (Smith and Lewis, 2011). The paradox theory has been applied to explain diverse organizational phenomena, including leadership (e.g., Zhang et al., 2015, 2017) and innovation (e.g., Andriopoulos and Lewis, 2009). For corporate sustainability, pursuing competing economic, social, and environment goals at the same time is essentially an organizational paradox (Hahn et al., 2014). The paradox perspective acknowledges the tensions underlying opposing goals. However, in contrast to other perspectives, the paradox perspective centers on the tensions with which organization and management scholars have little choice but to engage (Lindgreen and Maon, 2019), exploring how organizations and decision-makers experience and manage the tensions underlying the sustainability paradox (Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Gao and Bansal, 2013; Hahn et al., 2015). For example, in contrast to ignoring or eliminating conflicts (an “either/or” solution), scholars have found that embracing the tensions can lead to an innovative (“both-and”) solution, followed by sustainable outcomes (Tracey et al., 2011; Jarzabkowski et al., 2013; Jay, 2013; Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015; Ortiz-de-Mandojana and Bansal, 2016).

In this study, the authors adopt the dynamic equilibrium model proposed by Smith and Lewis (2011) on organizational paradox theory, attempting to offer a systematic review of academic developments in the management of the corporate sustainability paradox. The dynamic equilibrium model is influential in the literature of organizational paradox. It assumes that opposing forces of a paradox are dynamic rather than static, are persistent rather than transient within complex systems, and can be beneficial and powerful rather than detrimental and threatening. Specifically, the model encompasses three stages: how latent tensions turn into salience, how management strategies enable reinforcing cycles, and the outcomes of paradox management. The first stage introduces environmental factors and individuals’ cognition and rhetoric as the major two types of manifestation forces that render the latent paradoxical forces (e.g., social goal and economic goal) salient and tensional. The second stage proposes how resolution and acceptance strategies fuel vicious and virtuous cycles. The last stage describes how, while focusing on one goal might achieve short-term success, long-term sustainability depends on constant efforts to address the diverging goals in a mutually reinforcing fashion. As a meta-theoretical perspective, the model encompasses the nature, approach, and impact of paradox management, providing a holistic guide to frame and explore how sustainability as disciplinary knowledge deals with its own inherent paradoxes (Smith and Lewis, 2011, p. 297).

The current work is not the first review on the paradox perspective in the corporate sustainability field. In an earlier review, Van der Byl and Slawinski (2015) identify four major approaches in corporate sustainability, that is, win–win, trade-off, integrative, and paradox perspectives. The reviewers mainly offer a conceptual distinction of the paradox perspective from the other three perspectives and highlight the emergence of the paradox perspective in corporate sustainability research. However, up to 2014, the year before Van der Byl and Slawinski’s review was published, only eight articles (e.g., Berger et al., 2007; Wijen and Ansari, 2007) were found to adopt such a paradox lens. Later, in 2018, the Journal of Business Ethics published a thematic symposium on “paradoxes in corporate sustainability.” Among the issued articles, Hahn et al. (2018) are the first to develop a three-aspect framework, namely, descriptive, instrumental, and normative, and locate the six articles in the symposium within different aspects. Thereafter, the paradox perspective gained increasing recognition and sparked intensive research work among corporate sustainability scholars (e.g., Smith and Besharov, 2019; Hengst et al., 2020; Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020).

2020). However, as a disciplinary approach, this perspective is still in its infancy in the corporate sustainability area. Considering the rapid emergence of recent literature and the insufficient exploitation of existing research, a comprehensive and systemic review of corporate sustainability from the paradox perspective is timely and imperative. There is no preexisting published review specifically on this topic.

Guided by the three-stage dynamic equilibrium model, in this review, the authors aim to reveal the existing approaches to the manifestation of corporate sustainability tensions, the management of such tensions, and the downstream outcomes. In the rest of this article, the authors first outline the method for the selection of papers in the literature, then present the findings and discuss a future agenda for further corporate sustainability research, and finally outline the implications and conclusions of the review.

# RESEARCH METHODS

To conduct a systematic review of the literature of corporate sustainability from an organizational paradox perspective (Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015), the authors followed the PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al., 2009) to the extent that they apply to non-medical systematic reviews. The time span for the search was up to December 31, 2019. To ensure the initial search was broad enough, the authors mainly followed two influential reviews, the CSR review of Aguinis and Glavas (2012) and the corporate sustainability review of Van der Byl and Slawinski (2015), and targeted a total of 35 top management journals and specialized niche ones (see Table 1). Finally, the authors searched in corresponding journal databases (e.g., Web of Science) or homepages, using the following keywords in the titles, keywords, or abstracts of the journal articles:

Paradox OR ambivalen∗ OR ambidexterity OR integrat∗ OR institutional logic OR tension OR dilemma OR conflict OR dialect OR Yin-yang OR Tao

AND

sustainab∗ OR CSR OR social enterprise OR social entrepreneurship OR social partnership OR cross-section partnership OR hybrid organization OR microfinance OR social responsib∗ OR social performance OR social responsiveness OR corporate citizenship OR corporate responsibility OR stakeholder responsibilities OR triple bottom line.

To reduce the risk of bias, the whole process of identification and selection of articles was guided by the PRISMA method (see Figure 1 for the PRISMA flow diagram). After searching for each pair of keywords, the initial search returned 2,905 articles, including repeated ones. After filtering out any articles repeated more than once, three authors (coders A, B, and C) scanned the abstracts of the remaining papers to rule out ones irrelevant, or with only minimum relevance. Each article was assigned to two coders. The expected agreement due to chance between coders A and B was 0.59 (κ = 0.96), that between B and C was 0.50 (κ = 0.98), and that between A and C was 0.53 (κ = 0.92). These results illustrate high inter-rater reliability. The articles obviously deflecting from the corporate sustainability theme were removed from the literature pool (these papers concerned business school curricular development, organizational learning, incentive systems, work meaningfulness, trust, organizational innovation, entry decision-making, risk management, supply chain management, etc.). For the remaining articles, the authors further skimmed through the full text to decide whether they should be included in the review and then cross-validated the results. In this step, articles were excluded mainly if they (1) did not reflect a paradox perspective of corporate sustainability; (2) merely focused on the business frame, business case, or win–win perspective, rather than the paradox perspective of corporate sustainability; and (3) had a main theme concerned with sustainability over and above the corporate level, such as government procurement (Preuss, 2007) and the rise of socially responsible investment funds at the regional or national level (Yan et al., 2019).

After the screening, the authors retained a total of 141 articles. Through this process, the extensiveness and concentration of the literature review were simultaneously guaranteed. The journal distribution of these articles is presented in Table 2.

When conducting further analysis, the authors mainly concentrated on the three stages that Smith and Lewis (2011) proposed in their study on the dynamic equilibrium model of organizational paradox. In this theoretical piece, building on earlier foundational work (e.g., Cameron and Quinn, 1988; Lewis, 2000), they define a paradox as consisting of “contradictory yet interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time” (p. 386). A paradox, by definition, cannot be eliminated. Furthermore, any attempt to eliminate the paradoxes will only spark more tensions, resulting in vicious cycles (Vince and Broussine, 1996). To holistically address this cyclical nature of experiencing and managing paradox, Smith and Lewis (2011) theorize three phases: how tensions arise from latency and turn into salience under the stimulation of environmental and individual factors, how actors take purposeful responses to manage paradox mainly through resolution and acceptance, and how short-term outcomes fuel long-term success. An increasing number of studies in broader organizational context have demonstrated that if actors can embrace and be more comfortable with the paradoxes rather than defending themselves and denying the existence of paradoxes (Miron-Spektor et al., 2018), a virtuous cycle would occur and eventually lead to sustainable development. Leaders who display paradoxical traits (e.g., humility and narcissism, Zhang et al., 2017) and are more prominent in leading their subordinates also enable work-promoted outcomes (Zhang et al., 2015). Thus, corporate sustainability studies focusing on addressing the cyclical nature of paradoxes and relevant management practices at different stages are needed.

The three stages and specific items that the authors focused on when this model was applied to investigate corporate sustainability issues are as follows: (1) the manifestation of paradoxical tensions, (2) the management of sustainability paradoxes, and (3) outcomes. First, the authors identified the factors that could render paradoxical tensions salient and categorize them into environmental and individual ones (i.e., environmental plurality, change, scarcity, and

paradoxical cognition, respectively, according to the dynamic equilibrium model). Second, to depict the characteristics of these management processes, the authors analyzed the strategies and decided whether a proactive or defensive response is taken, and further coded these strategies as multi-level (e.g., involving managers from different levels), multi-stage (e.g., a dynamic and cyclic management process), or multi-paradox (e.g., both performing and organizing paradoxes are concerned). Finally, the authors investigated the short-term impacts (e.g., creativity and organizational learning) and long-term outcomes (e.g., economic and social performance enhancement) of these management strategies and their related practices. As for the initial screening of the focal articles, three of the authors independently analyzed the data. After each round of analysis, the authors discussed the coding together to resolve inconsistencies and ensure the accuracy and validity of the findings.

# FINDINGS

In this section, the authors answer the following questions. First, what factors make sustainability tensions salient? Second, what are the strategies (e.g., proactive or defensive characteristics) to manage sustainability paradoxes? Third, what are the outcomes (short-term and long-term)? A list of the representative articles and their coding information is found in Table 3.

In corporate sustainability research (see Table 3), hybrid organizations, such as social enterprises, attract much attention. Other hybrid forms, such as cross-sector collaboration, are also discussed in sustainability studies. Unlike social enterprises, which focus on the centrality of their social mission (Chell, 2007), for-proﬁt ﬁrms are under increasing attention because of their greater emphasis on economic values; nevertheless, this is still under-researched. On the methodology front, while single-case longitudinal research is still the most popular, quantitative examinations have been increasing in recent years.

# The Manifestation of Corporate Sustainability Paradoxes

Two sets of triggering factors that could manifest organizational paradoxical tensions have emerged, consistent with Smith and Lewis’ (2011) dynamic equilibrium model, namely, environmental factors and actors’ paradoxical cognition. The former emphasizes plurality, change, and the scarcity of the external environment, which all contribute to providing the material conditions of a paradox. The latter focuses on the actors themselves and highlights the role of personal frames and cognition. The research into paradoxical corporate sustainability also underlines these factors (see Table 3).

# Environmental Factors

In general, organizational paradox research has recognized the importance of environmental factors in providing the material conditions that lead to perplexing choices (Scherer et al., 2013). In the context of accelerated globalization (Slawinski et al., 2020), marketization and professionalization (Bruneel et al., 2020), environmental degradation (Daddi et al., 2019), and public health concerns (Iivonen, 2018), plurality, change, and scarcity emerging from complex environments enable sustainability paradoxes to occur, owing to competing economic, social, and environment goals (Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020). Specifically, plurality has been manifested in the pursuit of the triple bottom line (Elkington, 1997), multiple institutional logics (Dahlmann and Grosvold, 2017), and multiple stakeholder demands (Smith et al., 2013). Any excessive concern about any goal may be detrimental to sustainability outcomes (Jay et al., 2017; Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020); thus, tensions appear. These kinds of tensions would directly reflect on firms’ mission statements that combine economic pursuits and social or environmental visions. Some researchers show that the co-existence of social and economic/financial logics (Yan et al., 2019; Bruneel et al., 2020), market and community logics (Smets et al., 2015), or separate and integrated logics (Gümüsay et al., 2020) would provoke thorough tensions around the organization’s structure and identity and change would ensue as institutional logics define the material practices, assumptions, values, and beliefs of organizations (Thornton et al., 2012). Other researchers, mainly from the perspective of stakeholder management, find that tensions would emerge as a consequence of heterogeneous opinions, confusion around roles, and diffused power or responsibility (Slade Shantz et al., 2020) when considering a wider range of stakeholders (both insiders and outsiders) in the sustainability context, of whom there are essentially inconsistent expectations (Iivonen, 2018).

Many studies have stressed that, apart from changes due to prominent trends, the dynamic nature of an organization’s environment requires proactive adaptation for both the present and the future (Waldman and Bowen, 2016). For instance, the changes in organizational temporal structure and leadership styles (Sharma and Jaiswal, 2018), which are deeply rooted in a disparity in practice between “what should be” and “what is” (Winkler et al., 2020), would significantly provoke corporate sustainability tensions.

The triggering role of scarcity is magnified when researchers investigate special settings, such as entrepreneurship and social enterprises. Entrepreneurs with a paradoxical frame have limited resources, time, and expertise for sustainability options (Hahn et al., 2014). Davies and Doherty (2019) suggest that social enterprises struggle with more intensive sustainability tensions because of their insufficient attractiveness for capital.

the difficulty of hiring employees with similar identities, and stakeholder legitimacy. However, almost the entire discussion around environmental factors concentrates at the theoretical level. At this conceptual level, contradictory elements manifest more than interrelated ones, which essentially distinguishes paradoxical tensions of corporate sustainability from other tensions.

# Managing Sustainability Paradoxes

# Proactive vs. Defensive Responses

While firms constantly experience sustainability paradoxes, how firms or critical actors respond varies. Broadly, responses or management strategies can be categorized as proactive versus defensive (Hahn et al., 2018; Iivonen, 2018). Three major distinctions have been made between the two types. First, active response requires acknowledging the existence of paradoxes and the correlation between their conflicting elements (Lewis and Smith, 2014), whereas a defensive response involves actors who often deny or ignore the existence of such contradictions. Second, proactively responding actors regard it as feasible to achieve multiple contradictory goals at the same time, whereas those with a defensive strategy tend to divert or eliminate the tension between economic, environmental, and social demands (Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015). Third, actors adopting proactive responses often propose or make a fundamental change or a deviation from the existing stable state, while defensive responses constitute only a minor “natural extension” (Iivonen, 2018, p. 318) of the existing pattern.

# Proactive strategies

Proactive strategies encompass two critical components, differentiation and integration (Poole and Van de Ven, 1989; Smith and Tushman, 2005; Andriopoulos and Lewis, 2009; Smith, 2014). Differentiation includes spatial and temporal separations of competing elements within different boundaries (Smith et al., 2013). For example, the segmentation mechanism divides partnerships into sub-tracks, which then act as intermediaries among cross-departmental partners to buffer conflicts (Stadtler, 2018). Moreover, by separating and differently managing stakeholders’ benefits and expectations, a hybrid organization could successfully navigate between “community-focused” and “client-focused” orientations (Kannothra et al., 2018). For integration, previous work highlights the role of linking mechanisms (Hahn et al., 2016). A structural design, such as a hybrid set of members of the board (Bruneel et al., 2020), could combine business and social logics, and formal processes that regulate cross-function interaction (Battilana et al., 2015) could facilitate coordination and resource exchange. The authors observe that integration mechanisms are specifically addressed by some multinational enterprises. For example, Acquier et al. (2018) observe the international Japanese enterprise processes in multi-functional teams and cross-regional CSR projects to achieve highly integrated CSR, namely, increased professionalization and globalization, worldwide coordination, and the institutionalization of CSR. Some researchers argue that both differentiation and integration are indispensable for the organization (Smith and Tushman, 2005; Smith and Lewis, 2011) and can be utilized ambidextrously to produce a synergistic effect. For instance, Smets et al. (2015) came up with a segmenting–bridging–demarcating loop whereby both integration and differentiation are applied to daily work. When entering the German market, an Islamic bank uses polyphony (segmentation) to support individuals’ practices and polysemy (integration) to provide uniformity, which combine to foster organizational elasticity (Gümüsay et al., 2020). However, it is noteworthy that the current literature fails to answer the extent to which the firm should differentiate between and integrate its competing economic, social, and environmental goals simultaneously.

Existing research has investigated other proactive paradox management practices. First, well-utilized communication, as is important in the CSR research (e.g., Zhao et al., 2020), could be a vital method to engage in the sustainability paradox. A good example could be the transformation from self-persuasive rhetoric to the three-step agonistic CSR rhetoric (Winkler et al., 2020). By using (1) invitational rhetoric to define visions as provisional and revisable, (2) listening rhetoric to understand the reasons for dissension, and (3) rearticulation rhetoric to transfer authority from the speaker to the audience, the dynamic communication process finally leads to a virtuous cycle. Apart from internal conveyance, external communication strategies emphasizing the firms’ commitment to the environment, which may be further reinforced by third-party certifications, could maintain customers’ trust (Daddi et al., 2019).

Second, ongoing engagement of stakeholders helps them to live with paradoxes, as their expectations of conflicts are the primary source of paradoxical tensions. The interaction between managers and stakeholders could be regarded as a process of knowledge co-creation, generating the “power from below” to reshape the power relations to manage the tensions (Bolton and Landells, 2015), and the proactive engagement of both internal and external stakeholders could lead to mutual appreciation (Slawinski et al., 2020) to further address the paradoxical issues.

Third, some researchers regard paradoxical thinking itself as a valid approach to handle tensions, but the guardrails—leadership expertise, formal structures, stakeholder relationships—are still needed to keep the practice on track (Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020).

# Defensive strategy

Existing research favors investigating the proactive kind of responses to the sustainability paradox. However, in practice, companies often adopt defensive actions (Lewis, 2000; Smith and Lewis, 2012). When an organization’s primary goal is threatened (e.g., by institutional complexity), the organization tends to react defensively to minimize internal conflicts and/or external threats to its legitimacy. In the organizational paradox literature, a focus on defensive reactions to paradoxical situations has generated a vast array of categorizations (see Schad et al., 2016, for a recent review). For example, Lewis (2000) divides defensive reactions into six categories: splitting, projection, repression, regression, reaction formation, and ambivalence (Lewis, 2000; Iivonen, 2018). To blame a scapegoat, which is actually the combination of splitting and projection, and to simply repress unpleasant emotions and thoughts are much more heatedly discussed than other defensive reactions in the current corporate sustainability paradox management literature (Vince and Broussine, 1996). Personal framing, such as looking at a big picture or making favorable comparisons, could also be regarded as an effective defensive mechanism to neglect problematic elements (Child, 2020).

In addition, some researchers observe that firms adopt defensive actions to transfer tensions to their external stakeholders, such as customers. For example, Iivonen (2018) points out that the Coca-Cola Company completely denies the tensions between its economic goals and the obesity problem, blaming customers for their irrational choices and lack of self-regulation. Another example is the practice of the European Oil and Gas Supermajors, which reduce or avoid tensions through impression management (Ferns et al., 2019). By making use of three myths—the techno-fix, the Promethean oilman, and climate partnerships—these companies have successfully legitimized their environmentally harmful businesses. Daddi et al. (2019) also investigate how paper producers, textile companies, and tanneries tried to balance environmental engagement and competitiveness through defensive strategies. To obtain recycled raw material, the paper producers focused on improving their competitiveness through more significant technological inputs or improved selection management. For instance, to avoid such tension arising from paradoxes, a tannery that produced high-quality leather for luxury brands directly sold.

chrome (a material used to produce leather) recovered from the process to tanneries that produced inferior leather. In general, organizations tend to adopt defensive responses when their core business collides directly with sustainability development, as they consider these contradictions to be irreconcilable and threatening their survival (Iivonen, 2018; Daddi et al., 2019).

# Factors spurring proactive actions

The academic community concurs that defensive reactions would create negative feedback loops (Smith and Lewis, 2011) and ethical hazards (Hall et al., 2007) in the long run. Some researchers have investigated the individual and environmental factors that could encourage a proactive response and promote a virtuous cycle. Several scholars have reiterated the role of individual factors, including cognitive and behavioral complexity and emotion regulation, in the dynamic equilibrium model, among others (Corner and Pavlovich, 2016; Hahn et al., 2016; Waldman and Bowen, 2016; Slawinski et al., 2020). Leaders’ capabilities to maintain consistency in their behavior and emotions while navigating toward inconsistent goals are particularly highlighted (Smith and Lewis, 2011; Slawinski et al., 2020). Prior work has also pointed out some organizational factors in shaping the actions taken concerning the tensions. In addition to the organizational dynamic capability proposed in the dynamic equilibrium model (Smith and Lewis, 2011; Schneider and Clauß, 2020), strategic agility, including strategic sensitivity, collective commitment, and resource fluidity (Ivory and Brooks, 2018), and knowledge absorptive capability (Garst et al., 2020) have been found to be crucial in managing the corporate sustainability paradox.

# Characteristics of Management Strategies

Corporate sustainability paradoxes are “not linear or singular but were experienced by any actor, at any stage in the strategy process, according to the specific tasks they were implementing” (Hengst et al., 2020, p. 258). When handling the sustainability paradox, changes in the external environments may trigger new tensions that are sustained in accordance with previous tensions (Hahn et al., 2018). Thus, to manage sustainability paradox, coordination at different levels and stages as well as varied types of paradoxes have to be considered.

# Multi-Level

Tensions in sustainability can appear at different levels, including individual, organizational, and societal levels (Hahn et al., 2015). Most prior research concentrates on the individual and organizational levels. At the individual level, sustainability-related managers and key decision-makers, rather than employees, are the primary targets of focus. For instance, Carollo and Guerci (2018) explore how sustainability managers manage ambivalence in identity, and Wry and York (2017) analyze how social entrepreneurs understand the contradictions between different logics. At the organizational level, most studies investigate tensions in inter-organizational and cross-sectional (i.e., government, business, and civil society) relations (Le Ber and Branzei, 2010; Vurro et al., 2010; Stadtler, 2018). In mainstream CSR research, some efforts have been made to connect the micro-level to the macro-level (e.g., Jones et al., 2017; Poonamallee and Joy, 2018), but organizational paradox scholars point out that cross-level interactions around the sustainability paradox are underexplored (Schad et al., 2016), with a few exceptions. For example, Soderstrom and Heinze (2020) investigate a business collective from a social aggregation perspective. They reveal how such a type of organization serves as an intermediary based on how individual actions could converge into organizational responses, and how organizational practice influences individuals’ reactions. Furthermore, managers from middle management and top management teams could change and reshape each other’s frames, including business, business case, and paradoxical frames, among others (Sharma and Jaiswal, 2018). Managers may also be influenced by stakeholders and react differently, such as by adjusting priorities and constraining discretion responsibilities (Liu et al., 2015). Notwithstanding the growing literature on this topic, societal level and cross-level investigations are still scant.

# Multi-Stage

It is critical to recognize that the sustainability paradox is embedded in “long-term, iterative, reflexive, adaptive and co-evolving processes” (Smith and Lewis, 2011, p. 23). While most scholars agree that paradox management is a dynamic multi-stage process, researchers’ understanding of what dynamic means varies. Some scholars have argued that, as enterprises develop, the management goes through different periods that require stage-specific investigations, whereas other scholars emphasize a circular process. A good illustration of the former view is Puma’s practice in managing sustainability paradoxes in different periods (Baumann-Pauly et al., 2016). Puma has gone through three main development stages, paired with specific communication strategies for each. When forming connections with stakeholders, Puma first used a universal language through a dialogue platform. Then, Puma tried to select an appropriate language and reasons for each stakeholder group establishing common ground. Finally, Puma adopted a mixed legalization policy. A new reporting structure that directly linked sustainability data to financial data was developed in the third period. While these conversations may initially have been manipulative, they resulted in committed partnerships over time.

The existing literature has proposed a cyclic approach to understanding the dynamic nature of the sustainability paradox. Amaeshi (2010) uses a case study to develop a recursive model of paradoxes in social enterprises, conceptualizing the governance paradox as part of a social behavior cycle consisting of social context and structure. The governing paradox requires a (re)interpretation of the paradox, leading to a (new) continuous cycle of action. The recursive model describes the cyclical process of gradually improving the ability of boards to understand and manage these paradoxes over time. Smets et al. (2015) explore how insurers balance the contradictory relationship between market logic and community logic. They find that only the segmentation practice needs to be bridged, that bridging leads to demarcating, and that demarcating is confirmed again as a method to minimize this contradiction and maintain logical clarity. Therefore, these three mechanisms follow a circular.

# Resulting Downstream Effects

# Multi-Paradox

Organizational paradox theorists have categorized organizational paradoxes into various types. For example, Feldman and Pentland (2003) depict the tensions in organizational routings as stability vs. flexibility, Waldman and Bowen (2016) identify the tensions between agency and communion in leadership practice, and Besharov (2014) argues that there are relational tensions between managers and frontline employees. To understand the nature of paradoxes better, a more nuanced typology has been developed. Here, the authors keep with the widely accepted four-type categorization, namely, performing, learning, organizing, and belonging paradoxes, following Smith and Lewis (2011). While the sustainability paradox can be any combination of these four types of paradoxes, the authors contend that the performing type is most fundamental to understand the sustainability paradox. A performing paradox arises from competing goals, demands, and strategies, such as the simultaneous pursuit of economic, social, and environmental goals (Hahn et al., 2018). Most existing research on the sustainability paradox focuses on the performing paradox.

Some other researchers have also looked at multiple types of sustainability paradoxes. For example, the co-existence of a social mission and economic goals can involve various types of paradoxical tensions. First, an organizing paradox emerges when firms hire and socialize employees (Battilana and Dorado, 2010; Battilana et al., 2015), or (re)design their organizational structure (Battilana et al., 2012; Stadtler, 2018) and legal forms (Haigh and Hoffman, 2011; Battilana et al., 2012). Second, a belonging paradox occurs when organizational actors have opposing values, beliefs, or identities while confronting and resolving a set of competing goals (Phillips and Tracey, 2007; Battilana and Dorado, 2010; Smets et al., 2015; Demers and Gond, 2020). For example, employees conceptualize their roles differently in CSR activities (Seivwright and Unsworth, 2016). Third, a learning paradox could be salient since success in sustainability requires both short-term and long-term efforts (Midttun, 2007; Hahn, 2009; Pache and Santos, 2013).

However, in articles that identify multiple types of sustainability paradoxes, regardless of how the authors classify the types, they tend to simplify the complexity underlying the simultaneously co-existing paradoxes. Instead, the existing literature has concentrated on certain types of paradoxes (mostly the performing paradox), and/or discussed the identified paradoxes separately. This separation tendency could constrain our understanding of the sustainability paradox’s intricate nature. A few exceptional studies have appeared recently. For example, Vallaster et al. (2020) adopt a comprehensive framework to investigate how dynamic capabilities affect various paradoxes differently. Winkler et al. (2020) show how agonistic rhetoric solves performing, organizing, and belonging paradoxes jointly. Therefore, the authors conclude that the complex relationships between various types of sustainability paradoxes, Theoretically, proactive responses to organizational paradoxes could lead to sustainable outcomes. In the short term, individuals, teams, and organizations are likely to display excellence through enhanced learning and creativity, flexibility and resilience, and stimulated potential, which would pave the way for long-term success (Smith and Lewis, 2011).

# Short-Term Effects

A body of research has empirically proved that proactive strategies could lead directly to tension mitigation. For instance, Smets et al. (2015) reveal how contradictory elements could co-exist, alleviating tensions and bringing benefits in daily work at the same time. The proactive shift toward agonistic rhetoric helps the organization to transcend tensions and to foster CSR (Winkler et al., 2020). Proactive strategies could also facilitate knowledge creation. Bolton and Landells (2015) suggest that the knowledge base created during the process of management–stakeholder interaction could further generate the power that impacts business vision. While Hahn et al. (2014) theoretically propose that sustainability challenges stimulate creative insights, Calic and Mosakowski (2016) prove that a sustainability orientation improves the innovation of entrepreneurs’ final projects. Wry and York (2017) also show that entrepreneurs who navigate dual logics have greater possibility of proactively integrating these and developing creative business models. Gümüsay et al. (2020) regard this resilience as the ability the organization gains from the adoption of a proactive mechanism to avoid permanently suffering the loss or being estranged. This can help the corporation to perceive and correct a tendency toward deviation and to handle emergencies.

Some researchers have discussed how the management of the corporate sustainability paradox affects corporate legitimacy. For example, sustainability efforts (Calic and Mosakowski, 2016) and paradoxical thinking (Scherer et al., 2013) could enhance and maintain the legitimacy gained from collective awareness and value (Dart, 2004). Moreover, organizations could obtain other instant benefits, such as corporate credibility (Schneider and Clauß, 2020), greater market engagement (Kannothra et al., 2018; Soderstrom and Heinze, 2020), and competitiveness (Fosfuri et al., 2016) by positively reacting to sustainability paradoxes, which would contribute to long-term value creation.

# Long-Term Effects

Scholars have usually used synergistically increased organizational economic and social performance to depict sustainability success, even though economic and social pursuits could be detrimental to each other in the short run (Margolis and Walsh, 2003) and the effects on social or environmental performance are assumed only to manifest after a long period of time (Hoffman et al., 2010). Typical indicators of economic performance include profit, sales, or their annual rates of increase (Pache and Santos, 2013). Social performance is reflected in greater social impact, such as higher social employment.

# Corporate Sustainability Paradox Management

(Pache and Santos, 2013; Battilana et al., 2015; Smith and Besharov, 2019), community regeneration (Slawinski et al., 2020), and community income increase (Kannothra et al., 2018). Proactive responses to the corporate sustainability paradox, which is the determining precondition for a virtuous cycle (Smith and Lewis, 2011), have been verified to enhance economic and social performance simultaneously (Crilly and Sloan, 2012; Pache and Santos, 2013; Smith and Besharov, 2019).

By contrast, defensive reactions that would lead to a vicious cycle cannot facilitate sustainable development (Smith and Lewis, 2011). Defensive responses, which are usually argued to be a potential barrier to sustainability, may counterintuitively bring some positive effects (Ferns et al., 2019). For example, a luxury leather producer that sells recycled material to other tanneries and refuses to produce inferior leather itself (a defensive strategy) successfully maintains the trust of its customers toward their own product quality (Daddi et al., 2019).

# AGENDA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

In this study, using the PRISMA methodology, the authors reviewed the existing research with a paradox perspective on sustainability. By adopting Smith and Lewis’ (2011) dynamic equilibrium model, the authors revealed how the prior sustainability literature concerns the investigation of the manifestation process of tensions among sustainability goals, the management strategies that organizations use to respond to the tensions, and resulting outcomes.

During synthesizing and mapping of previous studies, ample future research opportunities appear. First, the authors propose that the nature of the corporate sustainability paradox (i.e., its constitution vs. its social construction) requires further exploration, including theoretical clarity and empirical examination. In the mainstream organizational paradox literature, there is an ontological debate on whether paradoxical tensions are inherent in the system or socially constructed (Clegg, 2002; El-Sawad et al., 2004; Ashcraft et al., 2009). Smith and Lewis (2011) propose an integrative approach by arguing for the corporate sustainability paradox’s dual nature in simultaneously highlighting the roles of material conditions and organizational actors during the manifestation process. With a quantum approach, Hahn and Knight (2020) conceptualize the paradox as both inherent and socially constructed (for a counterpoint, see Li, 2020).

This debate penetrates sustainability research and potentially shapes management strategies. With a few exceptions, such as Sharma and Bansal (2017), who directly bring the opposing poles together by revealing the interaction between action and cognition, the nature of the sustainability paradox in the current literature is yet to be fully explored. Rather than looking for clues as to whether the researcher holds a material view (e.g., Waldman and Bowen, 2016) or a socially constructive view (e.g., Child, 2020; Vallaster et al., 2020), this fundamental question requires more in-depth exploration.

Second, it is desirable to investigate the sustainability paradox management of for-profit organizations. When investigating management of the corporate sustainability paradox, the main focus of the existing literature is on social enterprises or non-profit organizations, not for-profit organizations (Smith et al., 2013; Battilana et al., 2015; Wry and York, 2017; Child, 2020). Yet tensions are also embedded in the often hybrid forms of for-profit organizations, bringing paradox management insights to researchers (e.g., Smets et al., 2015; Acquier et al., 2018; Schneider and Clauß, 2020). Moreover, for-profit organizations, originally holding a business logic, may experience hurdles that are significantly different from those of social enterprises when pursuing corporate sustainability. Therefore, drawing from the “tensions” between researching social organizations and for-profit business organizations, the authors suggest that an organization’s form (non-profit vs. for-profit) could largely influence how the organization responds to and manages the sustainability paradox.

Third, the authors encourage more research on the micro-foundation of management of the corporate sustainability paradox. Organizational psychology would shed light on this line of research. There is a need to explore how the cognitions, attitudes, and emotions of managers and employees (cf., Chin et al., 2013; Li et al., 2020; Sarfraz et al., 2020) play a role in corporate sustainability paradox management. For instance, the significant role of paradoxical thinking is reflected in its dual effect. On one hand, individuals with the paradoxical frame are more acutely sensitized to and aware of the interconnections among seemingly opposing demands. On the other hand, a general tendency to endorse paradoxical thinking can “motivate” actors to seek solutions proactively. In the organizational paradox literature, paradoxical thinking has been identified as an effective factor to benefit creative behavior and in-role performance (Miron-Spektor et al., 2011, 2018). In the sustainability literature, some researchers have investigated the paradoxical frames of managers (Hahn et al., 2014; Sharma and Jaiswal, 2018; Schneider and Clauß, 2020), specifically CSR managers (Carollo and Guerci, 2018). The authors argue that paradox leadership (behavior) (Zhang et al., 2015, 2017) also has the potential to foster the paradoxical thinking and behaviors of subordinates, thereby creating a supportive climate for corporate sustainability.

Furthermore, the role of employee engagement together with its underlying micro-foundation are greatly ignored when using a paradox perspective compared to those in the traditional CSR research (Glavas, 2016; De Roeck and Maon, 2018). Based on the current efforts (e.g., Demers and Gond, 2020), the authors consider the mechanisms underlying the actors’ cognitive frames to be missing in the context of sustainability issues. While Child (2020) mentions that one’s cognitive frame can be altered, questions like how managers reconstruct their frames or how the manipulation of framings on suitability issues impact the paradox management and sustainability outcome would extend our understanding of the micro-foundation of the sustainability paradox (Sharma and Jaiswal, 2018).

Fourth, some researchers challenge the prevailing opinion on proactive and defensive strategies, which urges more research.

investigations. Originally, a proactive strategy was favored as it would lead to a virtuous cycle and achieve sustainability outcomes (Smith and Lewis, 2011). There is increasing research, especially by those observing controversial industry practices, implying the lack of a direct link between proactive responses and immediately appealing performance outcomes (Iivonen, 2018; Ferns et al., 2019). Moreover, some recent studies have revealed successful sustainability achievement through defensive strategies, in addition to proactive management strategies (Daddi et al., 2019; Garst et al., 2020). The authors propose that these inconsistencies require further examination of hybrid of proactive and defensive strategies in corporate sustainability management.

Finally, a unified standard for a sustainability outcome is needed in future research. In some studies, the authors use the short-term effects to claim promising long-term achievements without substantial supporting evidence. In other cases, some researchers investigate whether the company could use its profit to cover the costs of social extension (e.g., Slawinski et al., 2020). Essentially, these examples reflect the lack of a unified standard on what sustainability outcomes actually mean. Therefore, the authors propose that sustainability scholars and practitioners should work together on a list of more effective indicators and a proper time span for which to evaluate sustainability outcomes.

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The paradoxical nature of corporate sustainability, namely, the need to address social, ecological, and commercial concerns simultaneously, is at the core of corporate sustainability research. The literature on how corporations and firm decision-makers should address the sustainability paradox has rapidly evolved in the past decade. Hence, in this study, the authors reviewed existing sustainability research prior to 2020 when the paradox perspective received direct attention (Van der Byl and Slawinski, 2015; Hahn et al., 2018). After a systematic review of 141 articles published in the top management and corporate sustainability journals, the authors adopted Smith and Lewis’ (2011) dynamic equilibrium model to inductively reveal how prior sustainability researchers have investigated how tensions have manifested among sustainability goals, the management strategies by which organizations respond to the tensions, and the resulting outcomes. The authors then offered a road map for future inquiries on integrating the organizational paradox perspective and corporate sustainability research.

This review has several practical implications. Leaders of firms would best manage the corporate sustainability paradox by understanding the paradox and its equilibrium stages. Understanding how and why firms are affected by opposing tensions and the stage they are in enables firms to better position their firms and develop their own strategies, for example, by pursuing social aims associated with their core business (Kaul and Luo, 2018). Even though firms struggle to reach all their competing goals, which constitutes the sustainability paradox (e.g., Davies and Doherty, 2019), the key to achieving sustainability is not to ignore or escape any contradictory goals. Instead, leaders should learn to be “paradox-savvy” to promote proactive strategies at different levels of their management practice (Waldman and Bowen, 2016).

For middle managers of firms, this review suggests that firms could provide development training on how middle managers attend to these tensions and how middle managers communicate this information from firm leaders and top managers to operational managers and employees. Middle managers are recognized as the major force resisting organizational change (Miles, 1997; Floyd and Lane, 2000). Without adequate commitment to organizational change actions, middle managers can cause organizational inertia or chaos (Huy, 2002). Therefore, attention should be paid to how middle managers, as the information synthesizer and facilitator between top and operating management levels, categorize, blend, and sell information on the sustainability paradoxes in the overall setting of a firm’s strategies and implementations.

In conclusion, an understanding of how the existing literature has advanced knowledge of the management corporate sustainability paradox is timely for both scholars and practitioners alike. By incorporating Smith and Lewis’ (2011) dynamic equilibrium model, this review has distinguished the paradox perspective from previous major approaches in corporate sustainability management. It further provides findings on how corporate sustainability tensions manifest and are managed, and how they impact firms and society as a whole.

Abstract: Green shared vision (GSV) has provided a research prototype for past green management research topics; however, few studies have examined the confusion related to environmental issues among employees. Therefore, to fill the aforementioned research gap, this study used psychological ownership theory and expectancy–valence theory to establish a research framework for GSV. This study explored the relationships of GSV with employee green confusion (EGC) and employee environmental performance (EEP) as well as the mediating effect of green product psychological ownership (GPPO) on these relationships. The research results indicate that GSV positively affects GPPO, EGC, and EEP. Moreover, GSV also influences behavior and performance through personal psychological processes. Thus, if an enterprise wishes to establish GSV, it must adopt a series of supporting measures, including improving members’ GPPO, to effectively reduce EGC and improve EEP to realize the goal of sustainable development.

# 1. Introduction

Corporate strategies worldwide are affected by environmental management issues [1]. When enterprises support environmental protection and actively participate in environmental management, they not only pursue corporate values but also improve their image by complying with environmental regulations [2]. Enterprises should embrace the philosophy of sustainability with a creative mind in this environmentalistic age [3, 4]. In general, shared visions are developed at the organizational, group, or individual levels to generate motivation for achieving transformation from a present status to a desirable end status [5]. When the organizational planner has a strong vision, the sustainable development of a company is promoted [6]. Obtaining a better understanding of the driving forces behind the phenomena might help new companies to integrate resources and enhance their corporate performance [7]. A corporate shared vision is a key factor affecting the competitive advantage of a corporation over other entities. Currently, sustainable development has become an important issue worldwide. The pursuit and achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) has become a trend for companies. Therefore, corporate sustainability has become a major topic.

Corporate sustainability refers to decreasing the waste of natural resources (especially nonrenewable resources) to zero during enterprise operational activities to reduce the damage caused by corporate activities on society or the environment [8]. Corporate sustainability has become an indispensable strategy for many companies today [9 – 11]. Such strategies are gradually being integrated into company activities and culture, whether with respect to the corporate system (including operations), strategies, organizational systems, or stakeholders (internal and external as well as social and environmental) [12]. Corporate sustainability has become the basis of sustainable success [13]. When employees and organizations have different values, implementing a developed sustainability plan is difficult [14]. Employees are the core resource of an enterprise [15]. Employees play an important role in maintaining the competitive advantage of an organization. They also determine the performance of the organization [16]. A company’s ability to achieve a competitive advantage is related to its ability to employ excellent talent [17].

Given the aforementioned information, employees play an important role when designing sustainable development strategies for an enterprise. The occurrence of employee green confusion (EGC) cannot be ruled out when employees promote green shared vision (GSV). However, studies on green confusion have not focused on the views of an enterprise’s employees. Most of these studies have examined consumer orientation and have focused on the effects of greenwash on consumers, such as the effects of greenwash on green consumer confusion and green trust [18] as well as environmental and product perceptions [19]. Thus, employee orientation related to confusion in the field of corporate sustainability has been rarely discussed. To fill this research gap, the present study proposes a new concept called EGC. This study refers to the definition of Chen and Chang [18] to define EGC as the confusion of employees regarding the environmental characteristics of company products or services. The present study developed an integral framework of employee environmental performance (EEP). It also investigated the relationships of GSV with EGC and EEP as well as the mediating effects of green product psychological ownership (GPPO) on these relationships. Environmentalism is an important corporate issue today, and EEP is critical to corporate sustainability. This research enables a better understanding of the effects of a shared vision and various types of integration on corporate management.

Studies have rarely used a theoretical basis to explore the effect of organizational members’ psychological processes on the organization’s environmental management performance [1,20 – 26]. This study investigated the effect of GSV on GPPO, EGC, and EEP by focusing on company staff and using psychological ownership (PO) theory and expected price theory. We used the obtained findings to fill the research gap on EGC issues in corporate sustainability research. This study proposes a comprehensive conceptual structure to explore the effect of company members’ psychological processes regarding the company’s green issues on the company’s green management performance. The integrated conceptual structure is displayed in Figure 1.

# 2.1. Negative Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Employee Green Confusion (EGC)

Given the global trend of concern for environmental issues, existing strict environmental regulations, and customers’ perception of the environment, companies must develop suitable legal strategies to gain valuable resources [27,28]. A collective strategic direction can be encapsulated in a shared vision, which guides company members’ actions according to a certain approach [29]. A shared vision can also be used to encourage corporate employees to exhibit excellent performance [30]. A shared vision is a key aspect of strategic management for a company because it indicates the unique objective, general direction, and practices of the company [31]. The method used by an organization to develop a shared vision has become the primary focus of environmental management research. The concept of GSV is defined on the basis of environmental friendliness and sustainable development [24]. Managers establish clear and common environmental goals for future organizational development, which enables the organization to supervise the green behavior and performance of employees as well as minimize EGC.

Staff confusion may occur when a company provides excessively similar, excessively complex, or an excessive amount of product or service information regarding SDGs. The larger the amount of information processed by an individual, the higher is their likelihood of experiencing information overload [32]. Information overload creates confusion [33], and EGC may affect a company’s SDGs. This research refers to the definition of EGC provided by Chen and Chang [18], who stated that EGC refers to employees’ inability to correctly understand the environmental characteristics of their company’s products and services as well as the characteristics of its environmental policy during information processing. Therefore, companies must formulate a clear green common vision and effectively obtain employee recognition to encourage the green behavior and performance of employees [24, 34,35]. GSV can encourage the green behavior and performance of employees, effectively develop employee recognition, and eliminate EGC. GSV is negatively related to EGC. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:

Hypothesis 1 (H1). GSV is negatively associated with EGC.

# 2.2. Positive Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)

Currently, many companies are facing challenges caused by the rise of global environmental awareness, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and increasing consumer environmental awareness. To ensure that valuable resources are obtained legally, an organization must formulate a suitable legal strategy [27, 28]. A carefully planned and designed company vision facilitates employees’ actions and decisions and inspires them to move toward a shared vision [36]. A shared vision is a common future goal set by an organization’s manager for the development of the organization. It conveys the norms and beliefs of the company to members. A shared vision can motivate employees to perform [30] and exceed expectations related to their work performance [34].

When an organization proactively performs environmental actions, its long-term goals with respect to corporate greening are conveyed to its staff [37]. Environmental improvement performance depends on whether a shared vision exists between staff and managers, especially when environmental strategies require intensive staff engagement [38]. Above all, the process of combining corporate environmental performance and strategy is profoundly affected by the shared vision [39]. A shared vision can reduce the adverse effects caused by senior team members setting different goals and having conflicting views [40,41]. Moreover, such a vision can prevent the fragmentation of a team.

Team members must establish a shared vision, and continual interaction, practice, and reflection can improve team performance [42]. With regard to EEP, organization managers can influence green purchasing behavior [43], promote environmental market-oriented strategies [44], and encourage

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

employees to have a responsible attitude toward environmental issues [ 45 ]. Organizations should always encourage members who possess good intentions, especially those who adopt a responsible attitude toward environmental issues. This step would enable employees to perform responsible actions when environmental problems arise.

Employees play an important role in promoting green management in an enterprise. Paillé and Meija-Morelos [ 46 ] defined EEP as the performance of employees’ compliance with company norms, and their interaction and communication based on personal environmental knowledge to relevant stakeholders. Expectancy–valence theory is a cognitive motivation theory that connects the energy of an individual’s motivation or willingness to strive for goals and expectations and obtain the expected value of the incentives to a specific purpose [47].

According to expectancy–valence theory, the choice, performance, and continuity of organization members’ achievement behaviors are affected by expectations and values [48], which results in individuals investing increased efforts to obtain expected values [49 ]. When a company develops a suitable GSV, the GSV motivates employees to strive for goals and values that contribute to employee behavior. Related research has indicated that a shared vision is crucial for enhancing employee environmental behavior [24,34,35,50]. Consequently, the following hypothesis is proposed:

# Hypothesis 2 (H2). GSV is positively associated with EEP.

# 2.3. Effects of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)

Psychological Ownership (PO) refers to the relationship between a person and an object that is closely connected with the self [ 51 ]. The concept of ownership is partially based on the research of consumer behavior regarding the extended self and possession [ 52 ,53 ]. Isaacs [ 54 ] indicated that the thoughts in a person’s mind become a part of them. For an individual, when property is accepted in the mind, it becomes “mine” [55]. Legal ownership can provide an opportunity for individuals to assimilate themselves into a company and become part of it, which can enhance the emergence of ownership as a mental status [56]. Because ownership connects possessors to targets, when employees link work with emotion, their connection with the work becomes closer. Furthermore, positive attitudes and thoughts are generated to further promote work performance [57 ]. Ownership is a mental status experienced by humans in which people consider themselves to own a target (nonmaterial or material in nature) completely or partially [ 58]. According to Pierce et al. [58 ], PO refers to a personal sense of possession held by an individual for an immaterial or material object (“this is mine!”). Due to PO, an individual is willing to take responsibility or sacrifice for their organization [59].

For the sustainable development of an enterprise, the degree of PO of company members for their company’s green products affects their behavior and attitude as well as the company’s green management performance. GPPO occurs when a company member has a psychological sense of ownership for the company’s green products, treats the products as subject matter, generates positive attitudes and thoughts, and is willing to engage in off-role behavior and take risks for this behavior such as dedication and sacrifice [ 35 ]. Therefore, for companies that are moving toward sustainable development, the degree of GPPO affects employees’ behavior, attitudes, and organizational green management performance. Furthermore, when a company employee has strong GPPO, they would exhibit a positive attitude and positive ideas, be willing to take risks for the company, and make additional efforts and sacrifices [35].

# 2.3.1. Positive Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)

Personal PO in organizations mainly originates from the four motivations of human needs: (1) Efficacy and effectance, (2) self-identity, (3) having a place, and (4) stimulation. Of these motivations, stimulation needs are incentives for PO. Efficacy and effectance indicate that individuals can successfully

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

exercise control and appear to have a sense of ownership, which is used as a source of attaining satisfaction. Self-Identity represents the personal experience of biasing the subject matter, and as a part of self-extension, the most important thing is to own. Such holdings symbolize a kind of identity and are interpreted by others. Having a place refers to the need for personal space, which motivates individuals to control their surroundings and invest in them. Stimulation drives individuals to use, care about, and maintain objects. Thus, people are motivated to achieve stimulating needs and meet awakening requirements [58–61].

Many factors influence the formation of PO. These factors influence not only the formation of PO and work characteristics but also the company culture, attitude of high-level managers, company’s goals and vision, and reputation of the company [62]. A common vision conveys an organization’s members’ common goals and ambitions for the organization [29, 63]. Moreover, it represents the organization’s vision, mission, and core values [64, 65]. Thus, when a company promotes sustainable development and formulates a GSV, this expresses to employees the goal and value of their efforts and strengthens their personal ownership and PO of the target green product. Chiu et al. [62] proposed that a company’s goals and vision affect PO. Moreover, according to Chang [35], GSV contributes to GPPO. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 3 (H3).

GSV is positively associated with GPPO.

# 2.3.2. Effect of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO) on Employee Green Confusion (EGC) and Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)

PO affects individuals’ attitudes, motivations, and behaviors. Furthermore, PO causes a person to exhibit a stance, sense of responsibility, and self-concept beyond the norms [66]. When an organization’s members have PO for their organization, they tend to exhibit more responsibility for their roles, take greater care of the organization, and adopt a protective attitude toward the organization [67]. Moreover, they may be willing to take risks or make personal sacrifices for the organization [59] and the subject matter of PO [59]. When members of an organization have PO for a certain subject matter, they may exhibit positive attitudes toward the organization [68]. Research has indicated that PO is an important predictor of the status of members of organizations [56, 58, 66, 69, 70]. Studies have indicated that factors such as the work performance and satisfaction of work can be predicted by organization-based PO [58, 59, 71, 72].

The PO of green products can predict individuals’ organizational citizenship behavior for the environment [35]. When PO is assigned to a certain subject matter, employees tend to regard it as a social entity, be psychologically related to it, be willing to take risks for it, and generate positive attitudes and behaviors toward it. In general, according to PO theory, GPPO refers to the PO generated by employees of a company for its green products when they regard the products as a subject matter. GPPO enables a company’s employees to exhibit positive attitudes and behaviors, and this contributes to organizational performance and encourages employees to actively search for information regarding company products, services, and related environmental policies that they did not understand initially. To maintain GPPO, employees become more willing to follow relevant environmental regulations and practices. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses:

# Hypothesis 4 (H4).

GPPO is negatively associated with EGC.

# Hypothesis 5 (H5).

GPPO is positively associated with EEP.

# 2.3.3. Mediating Effects of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)

PO differs according to the motivation for possession. The feeling of possession is ubiquitous. Possession can be a tangible goal, an intangible goal, or a statutory but not legal form of ownership [73].

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

When the inner and psychological feelings possessed by an individual are integrated, and the members of the organization will be based on human instinct motivation, they may feel such ownership due to various factors in the organization and practice to further satisfy. In particular, when the target slowly becomes a part of the owner’s psychological identification, PO is generated [58].

According to PO theory, an individual’s PO of a certain subject matter originates from four demand motivations that include (1) efficacy and effectance, (2) self-identity, (3) having a place, and (4) stimulation [58 –61]. The psychological history of PO as well as the personal positive behaviors and attitudes are based on interpretations of the subject of PO. According to the theoretical perspective of expectation motivation, an individual’s positive performance and contribution are related to the desire to meet expectations [48, 49]. Consequently, when the underlying motivation of an individual’s PO meets the expected value, the individual would exhibit a highly positive behavior and attitude. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:

# Hypothesis 6a (H6a).

The relationship between the exposure to EGC and GSV is mediated by GPPO.

# Hypothesis 6b (H6b).

The relationship between the exposure to EEP and GSV is mediated by GPPO.

# 2.4. Negative Effects of Employee Green Confusion (EGC) on Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)

Companies are facing considerable pressure from relevant stakeholders, such as customers, business partners, and environmental organizations, to focus their policies on the environment [74] and develop, produce, and sell environmentally friendly products. Companies intending to achieve the goal of sustainable development may do well to formulate a GSV to promote all aspects of relevant environmental protection measures to create a green image of themselves [75 – 79]. Employees may experience information overload when an enterprise manager releases excessive information regarding the enterprise’s environmental regulations, products, or services to quickly respond to requests from relevant stakeholders, such as customers, environmental organizations, and governments.

Mitchell, Walsh, and Yamin [32] indicated that people exhibit different levels of information cognition and digestion when they process information. When the amount of information increases, the likelihood of information overload also increases. The release of a large amount of information can cause confusion among employees [32, 33] as well as make it difficult for employees to focus on the relevant environmental regulations promoted by the company and to interactively exchange environmental knowledge with relevant stakeholders. The aforementioned phenomenon of employee confusion is called EGC. When EGC occurs, employees’ interactions with their organization’s relevant norms and stakeholders are affected. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 7 (H7).

EGC is negatively associated with EEP.

The research framework is illustrated in Figure 2.

# 3. Methodology and Measurement

# 3.1. Data Collection and Sample

To verify the aforementioned hypotheses in the Taiwan production industry, a questionnaire survey was conducted. The study participants were staff members who worked in the information services, electronics, components manufacturing, computer and peripheral products, health care and biotech, communication equipment manufacturing, electronic products and components, equipment and machinery manufacturing, and software industries in Taiwan. The questionnaire survey sample was randomly selected from the “Business Directory of Taiwan.” The participants were leaders or managers of the manufacturing, research and development, environment, or marketing departments or members of environmental product development projects. To ensure a high degree of content validity in this research, two rounds of pretests were conducted.

Respondents from different industries and sectors were recruited in this study because such recruitment reduces common method variance problems. To effectively improve the response rate, reliability, and validity of the questionnaire, before the questionnaire was issued, we contacted the relevant companies by phone to determine whether they provided green products or related services and confirmed whether green products were their primary revenue source. We provided gifts to the respondents after they filled the questionnaire. On the first page of the questionnaire, the research objectives were explained, and informed consent was requested from the participants. The participants were then informed that the green products or related services provided by their company were the evaluation targets of the company’s GSV, EGC, EEP, and GPPO. We issued 750 formal questionnaires and obtained 475 valid questionnaires. Thus, the effective response rate was 63.33%. In this study, in order to effectively reduce the possible factors that MacKenzie and Podsakoff [80] pointed out that are likely to cause CMV, we can hide the respondent information, the design purpose of the item, and randomly sort the items when designing the questionnaire. Furthermore, as suggested by Cacioppo and Petty [81], the semantics and words used in the design of the questionnaire are closer to the background of respondents. This can improve the entire questionnaire design, and we can survey people in different industries or units. Afterwards, the CMV test was conducted through Harman’s one-factor test. The result indicated that the load of the first factor was 28.319%, which met the standard value below 50%. As a result, there was no serious CMV problem.

# 3.2. Measurements

This research framework questionnaire contains four measurement dimensions (the scale presented in Appendix A), including GSV [25], GPPO [35], EGC [18,82], and EEP [46], using a 7-point Likert scale. While this research questionnaire refers to the scale developed by related scholars, there may still be research biases. This research is further verified through exploratory factor analysis, principal component analysis, and orthogonal rotation with varimax. The verification result shows that Bartlett’s test of sphericity and the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) value all as stated by standard value [83] is suitable for exploratory factor analysis, with 17 items and 4 components. The component names are the same as the original construct, namely GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP (Table 1). Nunnally and Bernstein [84] suggested that the standard value of correlation coefficient (Cronbach’s α) should be more than 0.7 and each aspect meets the standard value. Consequently, the questionnaire of this research has good reliability.

The standard deviations, means, and positive correlations of the constructs considered in this study are presented in Table 2. EGC was significantly negatively correlated with GSV, GPPO, and EEP, whereas the other constructs were significantly positively correlated.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

The loadings (λ) of all the items of the four constructs are presented in Table 3. All the loadings were significant and exhibited suitable values in the measurement mode. The Cronbach’s α can be used as an index for determining the reliability (the standard value is 0.7) [85]. We verified the Cronbach’s α values according to the recommendations of researchers such as Williams and Hazer [86] and Anderson and Gerbing [87]. The Cronbach’s α values of all the constructs were more than 0.7, as presented in Table 4. Therefore, the measurement reliability is consistent with an acceptable standard value.

According to Fornell and Larcker [88], when the square root of the average variation extracted (AVE) of the facet is greater than the correlation coefficient of the model facet, it means that each variable has discriminative validity, as shown in Table 2. The AVE square roots of the models GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP in this study are greater than the correlation coefficient of all the constructs. Thus, sufficient discriminant validity existed between any two constructs in this research.

|---|---|---|---|

Henseler, Ringle, and Sarstedt [89] pointed out that the effect of the original Fornell and Larcker [88] discriminant validity test may be overestimated. Hence, this study further uses average heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) to calculate the correlation ratio between the four facets of EEP, EGC, GSV, and GPPO. The overall result shows that it meets the standard value (all less than 0.85), so this study has good discriminative validity (see Table 4). A construct’s convergent validity is acceptable if its AVE is greater than 0.5. The AVEs of GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP were 0.688, 0.726, 0.736, and 0.628, respectively, which are greater than 0.5. Thus, the constructs considered in this study had suitable convergent validity. Besides, Bagozzi and Yi [90] pointed out that the R-square of the observation variable is >0.5, which means that each observation variable is suitable for measuring each potential variable (Table 3). The aforementioned results indicated that the measurements in this study had acceptable validity and reliability.

# 4.2. Structural Model Results

The analysis of moment structure and structural equation modeling were performed to test the research hypotheses. The structural modeling results are presented in Figure 3. According to the results, the full model had an acceptable fit (NFI = 0.951, CFI = 0.968, GFI = 0.928, and RMSEA = 0.061). GSV exhibited direct effects on EGC (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = −0.504), EEP (p &lt; 0.01, standardized direct effect = 0.148; Figure 3), and GPPO (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = 0.426). GPPO exhibited direct effects on EGC (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = −0.37) and EEP (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = 0.452). Moreover, EGC exhibited a direct effect on EEP (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = −0.307). The study results indicated that H1, H3, H4, H5, and H7 were supported. Thus, GSV has a direct and positive effect on GPPO, EGC, and EEP. GPPO has a direct and significant relationship with EGC and EEP, and EGC has a direct effect on EEP. According to Baron and Kenny [91], who verified the mediating effects, GPPO partially mediates the relationships of GSV with EGC and EEP.

Figure 3. Full model results.

To ensure preciseness, we performed a percentile bootstrap procedure and a deviation correction percentile bootstrap procedure 5000 times with a 95% confidence interval to examine two mediating models [92]. According to the advice of Preacher and Hayes [93], we calculated the confidence interval of the upper and lower bounds to verify whether the indirect effects were significant. The bootstrap test results presented in Table 5 indicated that GPPO partially mediated the relationship between GSV and EGC (standard indirect effect = −0.145, Z = 4.394, p &lt; 0.001; 0 was not included in the 95% confidence interval) and between GSV and EEP (standard indirect effect = 0.141, Z = 4.7, p &lt; 0.001; 0 was not included in the 95% confidence interval). Thus, hypotheses 6a and 6b were confirmed. After exploring the indirect effects of the variables of the structural model, we further examined the obtained data and found two unexpected intermediary relationships: (1) the mediation effect of EGC on the relationship between GSV and EEP (standard indirect effect = 0.113, Z = 2.216, Z &gt; 1.96; 0 is not included in the 95% confidence interval) and (2) the distal mediation effects: GSV and EEP via GPPO and EGC (standard indirect effect = 0.145, Z = 1.986, Z &gt; 1.96; 0 was not included in the 95% confidence interval).

# 5. Conclusions and Implications

In this study, we investigated Taiwanese companies that engage in environmental protection. We examined the effect of psychological processes related to green issues on employees’ green management performance. This study verified the relationships among GSV, EEP, GPPO, and EGC through PO theory and expectancy–valence theory. By investigating GSV and the PO of green products, we came to understand the effect of psychological processes related to green issues. Green management performance is enhanced by reducing EGC and improving EEP.

The study results indicate the existence of associations in the concept of integration. For example, the psychological processes related to green issues affect EGC and EEP. In addition, this study indicates that the antecedents of PO strengthen the PO effect as well as the behaviors and attitudes of the parties. The combined insights obtained from PO theory and expected value theory can contribute to sustainable environmental development. The results indicate that GSV has a significant negative correlation with EGC and a significant positive correlation with EEP. Thus, developing a GSV for an enterprise is an important strategy for the enterprise to achieve sustainable development. GSV can strengthen the PO.

of company members; encourage them to work harder to achieve the organization goals; minimize their doubts regarding the environmental policies, specifications, products, and other related information of the company; and improve their environmental performance. To achieve corporate sustainability, a company must strengthen its members’ GPPO and formulate a clear corporate GSV. The findings of this study have several theoretical implications.

# 5.1. Theoretical Implications

Our research provides three academic contributions to the sustainable development of green management in the field of psychology. First, the empirical results verified the hypothesis that expectancy–valence theory incorporates PO. When results meet people’s expectations, they receive additional investment and compensation, strengthening the PO’s degree [49, 94]. The aforementioned contribution expands the original expected value theory to fields such as topic teaching and learning for young children [94–97], unemployment issues [47, 98], and physical and mental health issues [99], which enables research gaps in the field of business management to be filled. Moreover, few studies have examined confusion issues from the perspective of employees. Therefore, this study used the views of PO theory and expectancy–valence theory to establish a research framework for GSV to fill an existing research gap. Second, the empirical results of the past GSV research literature found that GSV contributes to employee’s proenvironmental behavior [100], green product development performance [34, 101, 102], and organizational citizenship behavior for the environment [35], especially focusing on employee behavior and product development performance. Finally, the study results indicate the effect of psychological process related to green issues on green management performance in an integrated conceptual framework. The expectation value theory and PO theory indicate that relationships exist among GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP. This finding expands the contribution of psychology to sustainable environmental development. This study also verified PO theory by examining the mediation effects of EGC and EEP on the relationship between GPPO and GSV. The results indicated that GSV enhances the degree of PO and positively affects GPPO. The research model expands the PO model and indicates that GSV is crucial for the formation of PO, reduces a company’s EGC, and improves a company’s EEP. Thus, GPPO is critical for corporate sustainability [35, 103].

# 5.2. Practical Implications

The research findings can help Taiwanese companies promote environmental sustainability. These findings also provide a reference to other Asian companies seeking to perform green management. The research results indicate that a relationship exists between GSV and GPPO in psychological processes related to green issues. Moreover, the results indicate that an organization’s green management performance is affected by its EGC and EEP. This study indicates that EGC and EEP are caused by GSV and GPPO. GSV is positively correlated with EEP, GPPO is negatively correlated with EGC and positively correlated with EEP, and EGC is negatively correlated with EEP. The aforementioned results indicate that psychological processes related to green issues improve an organization’s green management performance. We found that employees’ EEP is affected by their EGC. Therefore, this study proposes several steps for corporate management to reduce EGC and promote EEP. First, the head of the enterprise management class should formulate a GSV, express the goals and aspirations of the company’s sustainable development, and regularly discuss and reflect on the amendments to the GSV. The development of a shared vision for the organization would improve organizational performance and motivate members to work toward organizational goal [29, 42, 63, 104, 105]. Thus, companies should use psychological processes related to green issues for verifying the execution results and adopt an active GSV strategy to create employee GPPO in their business models. By using the aforementioned strategy, companies can reduce employees’ EGC and improve their EEP. In particular, companies should formulate an environmental development blueprint and develop incentive plans to encourage their employees to participate in the design and production of environmental products. A good practice is for employees to participate in the production process of environmentally friendly.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

# 5.3. Limitations and Future Research

This study has certain limitations. First, the data analysis results unexpectedly revealed that EGC has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between GSV and EEP. The findings of this study provide preliminary concepts that should be verified using relevant studies. Second, this study analyzes the perspectives of expected value theory and psychological ownership theory and discusses the environmental behavior and performance of organizational employees. Future research can go further and use other theories. For example, the value theory can further strengthen the relationship between Psychological Processes of Green Issues and Green Management Performance through the exploration of Costs and benefits or the expectancy theory. Third, all the research participants were from Taiwan. The universality of the study results may be limited by differences in the national conditions, cultures, industrial scenarios, and economic structures between different countries. Therefore, the results of this study can be verified by conducting research in other countries and regions, such as Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. Finally, from the perspective of the company’s internal green management strategy, this study verifies that the psychological processes of company members related to green issues affect their GSV and GPPO. We also analyzed members’ environmental behavior and performance as well as excluding other behaviors and organizational characteristics that may disturb employees. In future research, we will be able to further explore the perceived organization’s support to the environment and the organization’s impact on the environment’s citizenship behavior [46]. Or, according to Chen, Chang, and Lin [24], starting from the green absorptive capacity of employees, further discuss the issues and determinants that affect employees’ environmental behavior and performance.

# 5.4. Conclusions

According to expectancy–valence theory, the psychological process related to green issues affect the background factors controlling the influence of GSV on company members. This study combined insights from PO theory and expectancy–valence theory and presented a psychological process structure. Due to the research gap related to the association between GSV and green management scope, this paper presents a framework that emphasizes how GSV affects the relationship between EGC and EEP through GPPO in the current environmental era. This research explored an extramental mechanism that illustrated the connection between GPPO and relevant variables. The research model indicates that EGC and EEP are affected by the exposure to GSV through an increase in GPPO. A Taiwanese employee sample was used to support the proposed hypotheses. This study provides many important

Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

implications for guiding managers and decision-making authorities. According to the integrated model of the psychological process of green issues in this study, the assumptions of expected value theory and psychological ownership theory indicate the psychological process of employees’ motivation and psychological ownership. The overall process of an enterprise to effectively strengthen employees’ mentality of green issues is an important key to improving the organization’s green management performance. In the process of improving EEP, companies must not only strengthen the psychological process of employees’ green issues, but reducing EGC is also an important key. Effectively reducing EGC can enable employees to devote themselves to work and contribute to EEP. Therefore, companies should upgrade their GSV to enhance their employees’ GPPO and EEP and decrease their employees’ EGC to achieve corporate sustainability goals.

# ABSTRACT

We study whether carbon emissions affect the cross-section of US stock returns. We find that stocks of firms with higher total carbon dioxide emissions (and changes in emissions) earn higher returns, controlling for size, book-to-market, and other return predictors. We cannot explain this carbon premium through differences in unexpected profitability or other known risk factors. We also find that institutional investors implement exclusionary screening based on direct emission intensity (the ratio of total emissions to sales) in a few salient industries. Overall, our results are consistent with an interpretation that investors are already demanding compensation for their exposure to carbon emission risk.

# 1. Introduction

Many studies seek to explain the cross-sectional pattern of stock returns based on exposures to aggregate risk factors such as size and book-to-market ratios, or firm-specific risk linked to observable firm characteristics. One variable that has so far been missing from the analysis is corporate carbon emissions. This omission may be for historical reasons, as concerns over global warming linked to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from human activity have only recently become salient. But, both the evidence

of rising temperatures and the renewed policy efforts to curb CO2 emissions raise the question of whether carbon emissions represent a material risk for investors that is reflected in the cross-section of stock returns and portfolio holdings.

Two major developments, in particular, suggest that this may be the case. First, the Paris COP 21 climate agreement of December 2015, with 195 signatories committing to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Second, the rising engagement of the finance industry with climate change, largely as a result of the call to non-governmental actors to join the fight against climate change at the COP 21. Institutional investors are increasingly tracking the greenhouse gas emissions of listed firms and forming coalitions such as Climate Action 100+ to engage with companies to reduce their carbon emissions.1 More and more asset owners are following the lead of the Church of England Pension Fund, whose stated goal is “to demonstrate transparently that it has delivered on its commitment to be aligned to the Paris Agreement.”2

Even if the US has pulled out of the Paris Agreement under the Trump administration, and even if the commitments of the other remaining signatories are only partially credible, major curbs in CO2 emissions are likely to be introduced over the next decade. Primarily affected by these curbs are the companies with operations generating high CO2 emissions, or with activities linked to companies in the value chain that have high CO2 emissions. In light of these developments, one would expect to see the risk with respect to carbon emissions to be reflected in the cross-section of stock returns. Yet, considerable skepticism remains, not least in the US where the Trump administration had worked to upend regulations that limit CO2 emissions. For example, Darren Woods, ExxonMobil’s CEO, recently declared that “Individual companies setting targets and then selling assets to another company so that their portfolio has a different carbon intensity has not solved the problem for the world.” And that ExxonMobil was “taking steps to solve the problem for society as a whole and not try and get into a beauty competition.”3

The lack of consensus among institutional investors around climate change naturally raises the possibility that carbon risk may not yet be reflected in asset prices. To find out, in this paper we systematically explore whether investors demand a carbon risk premium by looking at how stock returns vary with CO2 emissions across firms and industries. We undertake a standard cross-sectional analysis, asking whether carbon emissions affect cross-sectional US stock returns.

There are several ways in which one might expect CO2 emissions to affect stock returns. First, since CO2 emissions are tied to fossil-fuel energy use, returns are affected by fossil-fuel energy prices and commodity price risk. Relatedly, firms with disproportionately high CO2 emissions may be exposed to carbon pricing risk and other regulatory interventions to limit emissions. The firms that are most reliant on fossil energy are also more exposed to technology risk from lower-cost renewable energy. Forward-looking investors may seek compensation for holding the stocks of disproportionately high CO2 emitters and the associated higher carbon risk they expose themselves to, giving rise to a positive relation in the cross-section between a firm’s own CO2 emissions and its stock returns. We refer to this as the carbon risk premium hypothesis.

An interesting question is whether carbon emissions are perceived to be a systematic risk factor and whether the carbon risk premium is tied to loadings on this risk factor. Carbon emissions could be a systematic risk factor if expected regulatory interventions to curb emissions apply uniformly to all emissions. For example, if a large federal carbon tax were to be introduced, this would be a systematic shock affecting all companies with significant emissions. Alternatively, most regulatory interventions could be introduced in a piecemeal way at the state, industry, and municipal level. Similarly, technological improvements in the use of renewable energy could be mostly targeted to particular operations or sectors. In this case, one would not expect carbon emissions to be a systematic risk factor.

A second hypothesis is that financial markets are pricing carbon risk inefficiently and the risk associated with carbon emissions is underpriced. Carbon risk may not be fully integrated by most investors, who by force or habit look at future cash-flow projections through local thinking à la Gennaioli and Shleifer (2010), ignoring unrepresentative information about global warming and its attendant risks. To be sure, the cash-flow scenarios commonly used by financial analysts do not directly refer to carbon emissions and their possible future repricing. A recent study by In, Park, and Monk (2019) on a different sample than ours finds that a portfolio that is long stocks of companies with low carbon emissions and short stocks of companies with high emissions generates positive abnormal returns. We refer to this hypothesis as the market inefficiency, or carbon alpha, hypothesis. An important question we explore is whether financial markets underprice carbon risk (after controlling for other known risk factors, industry, and firm characteristics) to the point that responsible investors, who care about carbon emissions and climate change, could be “doing well by doing good.”

A third hypothesis is that the stocks of firms with high emissions are like other “sin stocks”; they are shunned by socially responsible, or ethical, investors to such an extent that the spurned firms present higher stock returns. A key question in this respect is how investors identify the firms to be divested from. Do they look at carbon emissions at the firm level, or do they pigeonhole firms into broader categories such as the industry they operate in? Even socially responsible investors that care about climate change may use sparse models (à la Gabaix, 2014) and not look much beyond industry categorizations, such as the energy and electric utility sectors, which produce a disproportionate share of CO2 emissions. Prominent divestors like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, for example, who have pledged to divest from fossil fuel companies, largely focus on energy companies that extract coal and oil from tar sands. We refer to this as the divestment hypothesis.

A pioneer in producing company-level CO2 emissions data is the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). It has been joined by other leading providers of carbon data, including MSCI ESG Research and Trucost, among others. While more and more institutional investors make use of the data, it is not known how much individual companies’ stock returns are actually affected by the availability of these more granular CO2 emissions data to financial analysts. Our study relies on the Trucost EDX data, which cover around 1,000 listed companies since fiscal year 2005, and over 2,900 listed companies in the US since fiscal year 2016. We match these data with the FactSet returns and balance sheet data for all US-listed companies from 2005 to 2017.

Carbon emissions from a company’s operations and economic activity are typically grouped into three different categories: direct emissions from production (scope 1), indirect emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat, or steam (scope 2), and other indirect emissions from the production of purchased materials, product use, waste disposal, outsourced activities, etc. (scope 3). The scope 3 category in turn is separated into upstream and downstream indirect emissions. The data on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions are widely reported. Scope 3 emissions on the other hand are estimated using an input-output matrix. Although scope 3 emissions are the most important component of companies’ emissions in a number of industries (e.g., automobile manufacturing), they have not been reported by companies until recently.

Our main broad finding is that carbon emissions significantly affect stock returns. For all three categories of emissions, we find a positive and statistically significant effect on firms’ stock returns. We designate the higher returns associated with higher emissions as a carbon premium. We estimate how this carbon premium is related to three different measures of corporate emissions: 1) the total level of emissions; 2) the year-by-year change in emissions; and 3) emission intensity, which measures carbon emissions per unit of sales. A striking result is that the carbon premium is related to the level of (and to changes in) emissions, but not to emission intensity. One reason why the premium is tied to total emissions is that regulations limiting emissions are more likely to target activities where the level of emissions is highest. For example, in its planned climate stress test, the Bank of England focuses only on large firms and measures risk in terms of required reductions in the level of emissions.

(see the 2021 biennial exploratory scenario on the financial risks from climate change (Bank of England discussion paper, 2019)). Similarly, since technological change generally involves a fixed cost, renewable energy is more likely to displace fossil fuels in firms where returns to scale are highest. Another consideration is that since emission intensity is a ratio, it is likely to be a noisier metric of carbon risk exposure. Two firms with identical emission intensities may vary substantially in their levels of emissions. Indeed, this is what we find: the correlation coefficient between the level of scope 1 emissions and emission intensity is 0.6, and significantly less for scope 2 and scope 3. Nevertheless, it is somewhat surprising that we find no premium associated with emission intensity since emission-intensive firms might well be the first to become unprofitable should the carbon price rise. Investors would then demand a premium for holding these firms.

Interestingly, there is also a significant carbon premium associated with the year-to-year growth in emissions. As one would expect, we find that the level of emissions is highly persistent. Hence, emission levels reflect a long-run risk exposure with respect to carbon emissions. Changes in emissions, in turn, reflect short-run effects; how much worse, or better, carbon risk gets. Of course, changes in emissions could also indicate changes in earnings, but we control for this effect by adding the company’s return on equity, sales growth, and earnings growth, among our independent variables.

The carbon premium is economically significant: A one-standard-deviation increase in respectively the level and change of scope 1 emissions leads to a 15-bps and 26-bps increase in stock returns, or respectively a 1.8% and 3.1% annualized increase. In addition, a one-standard-deviation increase in the level and change of scope 2 emissions leads to respectively a 24-bps and 18-bps increase in stock returns, or a 2.9% and 2.2% annualized increase. Finally, a corresponding one-standard-deviation increase in the level and change of scope 3 emissions increases stock returns by 33 bps and 31 bps per month, or 4.0% and 3.8% on an annual basis. Importantly, firms with higher emissions generate higher returns, after controlling for size, book-to-market, momentum, other well-recognized variables that predict returns, and firm characteristics, such as the value of property, plant & equipment (PPE), and investment over assets.

Other things equal, a carbon premium is the reflection of a lower investor demand for stocks of companies associated with high emissions. In equilibrium, this lower demand translates into a lower stock price, and possibly also lower holdings of high-emission stocks by some categories of investors. Following Hong and Kacperczyk (2009), we explore to what extent companies with high carbon emissions are treated like “sin stocks” by institutional investors. We find that, in aggregate, institutional investors do hold a significantly smaller fraction of companies with high scope 1 emission intensity, but they are not underweight companies with high levels of emissions. When we disaggregate by investor categories (mutual funds, insurance companies, banks, pension funds, and hedge funds), we find that insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds are underweight scope 1 emission intensity. The negative ownership effect of moving from high to low scope 1 emission-intensity firms is economically large and accounts for about 15%-20% of the cross-sectional variation in the ownership variable. This finding is in line with the rise in the sustainable investment movement and the popular negative exclusionary screening investment strategy followed by funds with an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) tilt.

We find that divestment is only based on scope 1 emission intensity. This is true both in aggregate and for each institutional investor category. Essentially, institutional investors have been applying exclusionary screens (or not) solely on the basis of scope 1 emission intensity. Even more remarkable, we find that when we exclude the industries with the highest CO2 emissions (oil & gas, utilities, and motor industries), there is no significant exclusionary screening at all by institutional investors. In other words, the exclusionary screening is done entirely in these salient industries; in all other industries, there is no significant divestment. Overall, these findings lead us to reject the divestment hypothesis. First, although there is significant divestment by institutional investors, it is not directly linked to an effect on stock returns. Institutional investor portfolios are significantly underweight firms with high scope 1 emission intensity, but stock returns are not affected significantly by emission intensity.

See Krueger, Sautner, and Starks (2020). Also, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Review 2018, negative/exclusionary screening is the largest sustainable investment strategy globally, representing $19.8 trillion of assets under management. http://www.gsi-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GSIR_Review2018.3.28.pdf.

Our finding that stock returns are positively related to the level (and changes) of carbon emissions is largely consistent with the view that investors are pricing in a carbon risk premium at the firm level. This result contradicts the carbon alpha hypothesis, whereby investors holding a portfolio long stocks of companies with low carbon emissions and short stocks of companies with high emissions generates positive abnormal returns. Garvey, Iyer, and Nash (2018) and In, Park, and Monk (2019) suggest that portfolios that sort stocks by emission intensity (going long stocks with low intensity and short stocks with high intensity) generate a positive alpha. In contrast, we find that there is no significant effect of carbon intensity on stock returns. Our study differs in two important respects from theirs. First, we cover a different time period and sample of firms. Second, we control for industry, firm characteristics, and known risk factors, while neither of these studies includes all of these controls. Controlling for industry significantly affects the results. Also, in contrast to In, Park, and Monk (2019), we analyze the effects of carbon emissions for each scope category separately, thereby avoiding double counting.

Another important finding is that the carbon premium has only materialized recently. We show that if we look back to the 1990s by imputing the 2005 cross-sectional distribution of total emissions to the 1990s, there is no significant carbon premium, consistent with the view that investors at that time likely did not pay as much attention to carbon emissions. However, if we apply the same analysis to our sample period, by imputing the 2017 cross-sectional distribution of emissions back throughout our sample period, we find that there is a highly significant carbon premium.

To summarize, investors seem to take a somewhat schizophrenic attitude to carbon emissions. On the one hand, institutional investors clearly want to take a proactive approach by divesting from industries with high CO2 emissions. On the other hand, this categorical exclusionary screening approach only partially addresses the carbon risk issue. Indeed, investors price in a carbon emission risk premium at the firm level in all industries even though divestment is concentrated in the industries with the highest CO2 emissions (oil & gas, utilities, and transportation industries). If there is one general lesson that emerges from our analysis it is that carbon risk cannot just be reduced to a fossil fuel supply problem. It is also a demand problem. Once one factors in both the supply and demand aspects, all companies in all sectors are exposed to various degrees to carbon emissions risk. A coarse exclusionary approach focusing only on the energy and utility sectors misses the full extent of the problem investors face. Accounting for carbon risk is also required on the demand side, which inevitably involves the careful tracking of emissions at the firm level in all sectors.

Our study is related to a rapidly growing literature on climate change and financial markets. An early study by Matsumura, Prakash, and Vera‐Munoz (2014) of S&P 500 firms between 2006 and 2008 looks at the effects of direct carbon emissions on firm value, and the effects of voluntary public disclosure of emissions (through CDP) on firm value. They find that higher emissions are associated with lower firm values, but that voluntary disclosure mitigates the negative valuation effect of emissions. Relatedly, Chava (2014) looks at the effects of environmental concerns, as reflected in KLD ratings, on firms’ cost of capital. He finds that firms that derive substantial revenues from the sale of coal or oil, as reflected in a KLD rating, are associated with a higher implied cost of capital. In an extensive survey of institutional investors, Krueger, Sautner, and Starks (2020) also find that institutional investors believe that carbon emissions represent a material risk. Among their responses, institutional investors also say that they do not believe that there is substantial underpricing of carbon risk. Andersson, Bolton, and Samama (2016) propose a carbon risk hedging strategy for passive investors based on low carbon indexes.

More recently, Ilhan, Sautner, and Vilkov (2020) find that carbon emissions increase downside risk as reflected in out‐of‐the‐money put option prices. Hsu, Li, and Tsou (2019) look at the effects of environmental pollution on the cross-section of stock returns. They find that highly polluting firms are more exposed to environmental regulation risk and command higher average returns. Engle et al. (2020) construct an index of climate news through textual analysis of The Wall Street Journal and other media and show how a dynamic portfolio strategy can be implemented that hedges risk with respect to climate change news. Görgen et al. (2019) construct a carbon‐risk factor and estimate a carbon beta for firms. Monasterolo and De Angelis (2019) explore whether investors demand higher risk premia for carbon-intensive assets following the COP 21 agreement.

Other related studies explore the asset pricing consequences of greater material risks linked to climate events and global warming. Hong, Li, and Xu (2019) find that the rising drought risk caused by climate change is not efficiently priced by stock markets. Several studies examine climate change and real estate prices. Baldauf, Garlappi, and Yannelis (2020) find little evidence

of declining prices as a result of greater flood risk due to sea level rise. Bakkensen and Barrage (2017) find that climate risk beliefs in coastal areas are highly heterogeneous and that rising flood risk due to climate change is not fully reflected in coastal house prices. Bernstein, Gustafson, and Lewis (2019) find that coastal homes vulnerable to sea-level rise are priced at a 6.6% discount relative to similar homes at higher elevations. However, in a related study, Murfin and Spiegel (2020) find no evidence that sea level rise risk is reflected in residential real estate prices. Finally, Giglio et al. (2018) use real estate pricing data to infer long-run discount rates for valuing investments in climate change abatement.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data and provide summary statistics. We discuss the results in Section 3. Concluding remarks are in Section 4.

# 2. Data and Sample

Our primary database covers the 2005-2017 period and is largely a result of matching two data sets by Trucost and FactSet in the US. Trucost provides information on corporate carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. FactSet provides data on stock returns, corporate fundamentals, and institutional ownership. We performed the matching using ISIN as a main identifier. In some instances, in which ISIN was not available to create a perfect match, we relied on matching based on company names (after standardizing the company names in FactSet and Trucost we match the names with a similarity score of one). Finally, when there are multiple subsidiaries of a given company, we used the primary location as a matching entity. The ultimate matching produced 3,421 unique companies out of 3,481 companies available in Trucost. Among the 60 companies we were not able to match, more than half are not exchange listed and the remaining ones are small. Hence, we believe our data cover almost the entire universe of companies with available emission data.

# 2.1. Data on corporate carbon emissions

Firm-level carbon emissions data are assembled by seven main providers: CDP, Trucost, MSCI, Sustainalytics, Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg, and ISS. All these providers follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol that sets the standards for measuring corporate emissions. More and more companies disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, and most large corporations report their emissions to CDP. Other providers rely on the CDP data and supplement it with other sources. Emissions can be measured directly at the source or more commonly by applying conversion factors to energy use. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol distinguishes between three different sources of emissions: scope 1 emissions, which cover direct emissions over one year from establishments that are owned or controlled by the company; these include all emissions from fossil fuel used in production. Scope 2 emissions come from the generation of purchased heat, steam, and electricity consumed by the company. Scope 3 emissions are caused by the operations and products of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company. These include emissions from the production of purchased materials, product use, waste disposal, and outsourced activities.

In some sectors, like automobile manufacturing, by far the most important component of their emissions is the aggregation of all their scope 3 emissions. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol distinguishes between 15 different categories of scope 3 emissions, including purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream & downstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, processing & use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. According to CDP’s 2016 Climate Change Report, most scope 3 emissions are concentrated in two categories: purchased goods and services (around 44%) and use of sold products (around 48%). The Greenhouse Gas Protocol provides detailed guidance on how to identify a company’s most important sources of scope 3 emissions and how to calculate them.

See https://ghgprotocol.org.

See http://ghgprotocol.org/standards/scope-3-standard.

See CDP 2016 Climate Change Report “Tracking Progress on Corporate Climate Action.”

Purchased goods and services, this basically involves measuring inputs, or “activity data,” and applying emission factors to these purchased inputs that convert activity data into emissions data. The upstream scope 3 data from Trucost that we use is constructed using an input-output model that provides the fraction of expenditures from one sector across all other sectors of the economy. This model is extended to include sector-level emission factors, so that an upstream scope 3 emissions estimate can be determined from each firm’s expenditures across all sectors from which it obtains its inputs (see Trucost, 2019). Downstream scope 3 emissions caused using sold products can also be estimated and are increasingly reported by companies. Trucost has recently started assembling this data, but we were not able to include it in our study.

Because they are easier to measure, and because disclosure requirements are stricter, data on scope 1 and scope 2 have been more systematically reported and accurately estimated. As Busch et al. (2018) show, there is very little variation in the reported scope 1 and 2 emissions data across the data providers. Correlations in the reported scope 1 (scope 2) data average 0.99 (0.98), across the five providers CDP, Trucost, MSCI, Sustainalytics, and Thomson Reuters. However, when it comes to estimated scope 1 and scope 2 emissions (when reported data are missing), the correlations drop to 0.79 and 0.63, respectively for the three providers, Trucost, MSCI, and Sustainalytics, that offer these estimates. Finally, only two data providers, Trucost and ISS ESG, provide estimates of scope 3 emissions. The Trucost EDX database we use in our main analysis reports all three scopes of carbon emissions in units of tons of CO2 emitted in a year. We report the summary statistics of the emissions variables in Panel A of Table 1.

The average firm in our sample produces 1.97 million tons of scope 1 emissions, and is tied to 1.72 million tons of scope 3 emissions. The quantity of scope 2 emissions is relatively smaller, at 342,000 tons of CO2 equivalent. Notably, the median number is the largest for scope 3 emissions, as almost all companies in our sample are tied to a significant quantity of such emissions. The scope 1, 2, and 3 measures are in units of tons of CO2 and normalized using the natural log scale. We also report annual growth rates in each emission measure. To mitigate the impact of outliers, we winsorize all growth measures at the 2.5% level. The carbon intensity of a company is expressed as tons of CO2 equivalent divided by the company’s revenues in million US dollar units, also winsorized at the 2.5% level. The average (unwinsorized) scope 1 intensity in our sample equals 265.26 tons/million, while the intensities for scope 2 and scope 3 are 39.64 tons/million and 164.22 tons/million, respectively. The EDX database also provides information on whether the emissions data was reported or estimated, which allows us to do a sensitivity analysis and determine how the results are affected by the exclusion of the estimated data. We describe how the data breaks down into firms with reported and estimated emissions data in Table 2. As Matsumura, Prakash, and Vera‐Munoz (2014) note, firms that do not report their emissions are typically smaller (and therefore have smaller emissions) and are less profitable. But in other respects, firms that report their emissions have similar characteristics to those that do not. In particular, their stock returns, volatility, leverage, book-to-market ratios, capital expenditures, and betas are very similar.

We also report alternative measures Trucost provides, in particular: i) CARBON DIRECT, which adds three additional greenhouse gases to the GHG Protocol scope 1 measures; ii) CARBON INDIRECT, which covers a slightly broader set of emissions by the direct suppliers to a company than scope 2; iii) GHG DIRECT, measured in US dollars, which covers all direct external environmental impacts of a company. Trucost applies a monetary value to GHG emissions quantities, which represents the global average damage of each environmental impact; and iv) GHG INDIRECT, which covers indirect supply chain environmental impacts. These are estimated impacts based on Trucost’s environmental impact models. Again, these are reported in US dollars and represent the global average damages of each environmental impact.

How correlated are these different emission variables? We report the cross-correlations in Panel A of Table 3. As one would expect, the levels of all three categories of emissions are positively correlated. Yet, the coefficients are relatively small. Similarly, the level of scope 1 emissions is obviously positively correlated with scope 1 emission intensity, but the size of the coefficient is only 0.6, reflecting the fact that two firms with the same scope 1 intensity may have very different levels of emissions.

More than 6,300 companies worldwide answered CDP’s climate change questionnaire in 2018. Of these, 76% disclosed scope 1 emissions, 68% scope 2 emissions, and 38% scope 3 emissions (see https://www.cdp.net).

# 2.2. Variables in cross-sectional return regressions

A large firm, with high emissions, can have the same emission intensity as a small firm. The low correlation between levels and intensity is even more pronounced for scope 2 (0.24) and scope 3 (0.27). In Panel B, we also report the autocorrelation coefficients for the different measures of emissions. Emission levels for all three categories are highly persistent, with an autocorrelation coefficient of 0.977 for scope 1, 0.955 for scope 2, and 0.967 for scope 3. Interestingly, the year-to-year growth in emissions also has some persistence, especially for scope 3 emissions. As for the emission intensity variables they are, not surprisingly, also highly persistent as sales are highly persistent.

We also analyze the average values of all three emission sources over time. Fig. 1 and Table 4 present the results. As one might expect, there is a steady decline in scope 1 and scope 3 emissions at the firm level over time as a result of energy efficiency improvements, technological innovations, and an increase in the reliance on renewable energy sources. There is a sharp decline in scope 1 emissions from 2015 to 2016. However, this mainly reflects the addition by Trucost of many smaller firms to the sample in 2015, as can be seen in Fig. 2. The addition of all these firms to the sample also explains why total scope 3 emissions sharply increase from 2015 to 2016, and why total scope 1 emissions remain flat even though per-firm emissions decline. All these results are further confirmed by the numbers in Panels A and B of Table 4; averages for all firms in our sample are in Panel A while those conditioned on the presence in the sample prior to 2015 are in Panel B. We can see that when we drop the new firms added in 2016 from the sample, the averages for 2016 and 2017 are very close to the numbers in 2015. While we still observe some decline in scope 1 emissions, there is no such decline in scope 2 and scope 3 emissions. If anything, the numbers for scope 3 emissions go up, although not by much.

We note that firms with significant emissions are represented in a wide range of industries. In Table 5, we present the distribution of firms in our sample with respect to the six-digit Global Industry Classification (GIC 6). Banks, biotech, and oil & gas are the most represented industries, with each one having more than 150 firms.12 In Table 6, we provide a list of industries with the highest and the lowest intensity of emissions. Power, electric, and multi-utility industries produce the most scope 1 emissions, while consumer finance, thrifts and mortgages, and capital markets are the cleanest. The ranking is somewhat different when we classify industries with respect to their scope 2 and scope 3 emissions. Metals and mining, electric utilities, and construction materials are the three most scope 2 emission-intensive industries (the cleanest industries mimic those based on scope 1 classification). In turn, food products, metals and mining, and construction materials are the three most scope 3 emission-intensive industries. Internet software and services, health care technologies, and software are the three least emission-intensive industries. The Trucost industry classification is finer than the GIC six-digit classification. Given that we control for industry a natural question is how sensitive the results are to the classification itself. The classification in theory could be so fine that it includes only one firm in each industry or so coarse that it includes all firms in one industry. Adding industry fixed effects would be meaningless under these polar classification systems. As a robustness check, we also perform our analysis under the GIC classification and report the results in Table A.4 in the Appendix.

Finally, we observe not only substantial variation in the growth rates of emissions across different industries, but also significant variation in the rates of all three categories of emissions across firms within the same industry. Fig. 3 displays the time series plots of the average cross-sectional standard deviations of emission growth rates across all firms (Panel A) and across all firms within a given GIC 6 industry (Panel B). Even though the scale of the variation in Panel A is larger than that in Panel B, there is still a significant dispersion in emissions in Panel B. Moreover, the standard deviation in carbon emission growth rates is very stable over time. In particular, the standard deviation did not significantly change following the addition of new firms to the sample in 2015.

12 Some firms in this table are classified into multiple industries; hence, the total number of firms in the table (3917) exceeds the number of unique firms in our sample (3421).

Our empirical analysis of stock returns employs a monthly measure of returns as a dependent variable. In our cross-sectional return regressions, the dependent variable RETi,t is the monthly return of an individual stock i in month t. Our return data primarily comes from FactSet, but for a small subset of delisted firms, we replace the return data with delisting-adjusted values from Compustat. Finally, we remove observations with returns greater than 100% to mitigate the impact of outliers. The number of excluded firm/month observations is 109 and its exclusion does not materially affect our results. However, using unrestricted returns data would be problematic as the data, for example, include four observations with monthly returns greater than 10,000%.

Our control variables are defined as follows: LOGSIZEi,t is the natural logarithm of firm i’s market capitalization (price times shares outstanding) at the end of year t; B/Mi,t is firm i’s book value divided by its market capitalization at the end of year t; LEVERAGE is the book leverage of the company; ROEi,t is the firm’s earnings performance, given by the ratio of firm i’s net yearly income divided by the value of its equity; MOMi,t is the average of the most recent 12 months’ returns on stock i, leading up to and including month t-1; INVEST/A represents the firm’s capital expenditures divided by the book value of its assets; HHI is the Herfindahl concentration index of firms with respect to different business segments, based on each segment’s revenues; LOGPPE is the natural logarithm of the firm’s property, plant, and equipment; BETAi,t is the market beta of firm i in year t, calculated over the one year period using daily data; VOLATi,t is the standard deviation of returns based on the past 12 months of monthly returns; SALESGRi,t is the dollar change in annual firm revenues normalized by last month’s market capitalization; EPSGRi,t is the dollar change in annual earnings per share, normalized by the firm’s equity price. To eliminate the impact of outliers, we winsorize B/M, LEVERAGE, and INVEST/A at the 2.5% level, and MOM, VOLAT, SALESGR, and EPSGR at the 0.5% level. We report the summary statistics of these variables in Panel B of Table 1.

The average firm’s monthly stock return is 1.14%, with a standard deviation of 10.84%. The average firm has a market capitalization of $13 billion, with a median value of $3.8 billion. The average book-to-market ratio is 0.50, while the average book leverage is 24%. The average market beta is 1.10, slightly more than that of the market.

# 2.3. Variables in the time series return regressions

The variables for our time series regressions are defined as follows: MKTRFt is the monthly return of the CRSP value-weighted portfolio in month t, net of the risk-free rate; SMB, HML, MOM, and CMAt are well-known portfolio return series downloaded from Ken French’s website: SMB is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on small stocks and short on large stocks; HML is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on high book-to-market stocks and short on low book-to-market stocks; MOM is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on past one-year return winners and short on past one-year return losers; CMA is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on conservative investment stocks and short on aggressive investment stocks. BAB is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low-beta stocks and short on high-beta stocks; LIQ is the liquidity factor of Pastor and Stambaugh; NET ISSUANCE is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on high-net-issuance stocks and short on low-net-issuance stocks. Net issuance for year t is the change in the natural log of split-adjusted shares outstanding from the fiscal yearend in t-2 to the fiscal yearend in t-1; IDIO VOL is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low idiosyncratic volatility stocks and short on high idiosyncratic volatility stocks. We present the summary statistics for the various portfolio returns in Panel C of Table 1.

The average market risk premium in our sample is 0.7% per month. Other factors with relatively high risk premia are net issuance and BAB. Somewhat atypically, the value factor return in our sample is equal to 0%. Similarly, the momentum factor generates a mere 0.07% per month, and the volatility factor has a negative return of -0.18% per month.

# 2.4. Variables in divestment regressions

Our institutional ownership regression variables are: IOi,t, which is the fraction of the shares of company i held by institutions in the FactSet database at the end of year t. IO is calculated by aggregating the shares held by all types of institutions.

at the end of the year, and then dividing this value by the number of shares outstanding at the end of the year. We further decompose the institutional ownership with respect to subgroups of owners. IO_BANKS is the ownership by banks; IO_INSURANCE is the ownership by insurance companies; IO_INVESTCOS is the ownership by investment companies (e.g., mutual funds); IO_ADVISERS is the ownership by independent investment advisers; IO_PENSIONS is the ownership by pension funds and IO_HFS is the ownership by hedge funds. Even though the total institutional ownership captures the intensive margin only, the range of disaggregated ownership variables varies from 0% to 100% (as long as the total institutional ownership in the data has a positive value).

The control variables in the ownership regressions include PRINVi,t, which is the inverse of firm i’s share price at the end of year t; VOLATi,t is the standard deviation of monthly stock returns for firm i over the one-year period; VOLUMEi,t is the average daily trading volume (in $million) of stock i over the calendar year t. NASDAQi,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is listed on NASDAQ in year t, and zero otherwise; SP500i,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is part of the S&P 500 Index in year t, and zero otherwise. We report the summary statistics for these variables in Panel D of Table 1.

The average IO is 0.77, and the cross-sectional standard deviation of IO is 0.22. In other words, in a typical year, a typical firm has about 77% of its shares held by institutional investors, and the standard deviation of institutional ownership in a typical cross-section is 22%. Among the different institutional owners, independent advisers are the biggest holders, with an average stock’s ownership equal to 43.9%, followed by investment companies with an average 18.2% ownership. Banks and insurance companies, in turn, are the smallest institutional owners. The average daily stock return volatility in our sample is 10% or annualized 158.7%. The average daily stock volume is $440,000. Finally, about 30% of stock-month observations are companies listed on NASDAQ, and 37% observations are firms from the S&P 500 Index.

# 3. Results

We begin our analysis by investigating the determinants of scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions. We then turn to the evaluation of the carbon return premium in the cross-section of stocks. We next explore the time-series properties of the cross-sectional carbon premium with respect to well-known risk factors. Finally, we consider the divestment hypothesis by looking at institutional ownership patterns.

# 3.1. Determinants of carbon emissions

Since emissions are not reported by all companies, one basic issue to explore first is how companies that do report their emissions compare with non-reporting companies. To assess the quantitative differences on the extensive margin, we compare various firm-level characteristics for the reporting and non-reporting firms. We describe basic summary statistics of the two categories of firms in Table A.1 of the Appendix. As one might expect, we find that larger firms are more likely to report their emissions. Also, firms with lower book-to-market ratios and higher book leverage are more likely to report emissions. At the same time, the two groups of firms do not differ significantly in terms of their stock returns or investment levels.

Next, we assess the differences in emission levels, year-by-year changes, and emission intensities across firms using a regression framework. Our dependent variables are levels, changes, and intensities of scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3. Since there is little theory that can guide us on what determines the level of carbon emissions, especially with regard to their different sources, we include a host of firm-level variables, comprising LOGSIZE, B/M, ROE, LEVERAGE, INVEST/A, HHI, LOGPPE, SALESGR, and EPSGR. To reflect the possibility that firm-level emissions could concentrate across firms and over time, we cluster standard errors at the firm and year levels. Standard errors in all panel regressions become significantly smaller in alternative specifications that cluster at the firm, industry, time, or industry and time levels. We present the results in Table 7.

Not surprisingly, all three categories of emission levels, and changes in emissions, are significantly positively related to LOGSIZE. However, scope 1 and scope 3 emission intensities are weakly negatively related to LOGSIZE. The level of emissions is also significantly associated with high book-to-market ratios, high tangible capital (PPE), highly levered firms, and firms with high

# 3.2. Evidence on cross-sectional returns

For all three categories of emissions, we relate in turn the level of companies’ emissions, the year-to-year growth in emissions, and the companies’ emission intensity to their corresponding stock returns in the cross-section. We first estimate the following cross-sectional regression model using pooled OLS:

(1) where measures the stock return of company i in month t and Emissions is a generic term alternately standing for SCOPE 1, SCOPE 2, and SCOPE 3 emissions. The vector of controls includes a host of firm-specific variables known to predict returns, such as LOGSIZE, B/M, ROE, LEVERAGE, MOM, INVEST/A, HHI, LOGPPE, BETA, VOLAT, SALESGR, and EPSGR. We also include year/month fixed effects. We cluster standard errors at the firm and year levels. Our coefficient of interest is.

We report the results in Table 8, Panel A. Column 1 shows the results for SCOPE 1; column 2 for SCOPE 2, and column 3 for SCOPE 3. For all three categories of emissions, we find a positive and statistically significant effect on firms’ stock returns. The effect is also economically significant: a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 1 leads to a 13-bps increase in stock returns, or 1.5% annualized, and a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 2 leads to a 23-bps increase in stock returns, or 2.8% annualized. Finally, a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 3 increases stock returns by 30 bps per month, or 3.6% annualized.

Since emissions tend to cluster significantly within specific industries, a question of interest is whether the firm-specific differences can be attributed to industry-specific effects. To examine this possibility, we additionally include industry-fixed effects using the Trucost industry classification. The results presented in columns 4 to 6 are quite striking. Including industry effects significantly strengthens the cross-sectional dispersion of returns due to carbon emissions. In fact, the economic significance increases by anywhere between 70% and 280% relative to the model without industry effects.

We also plot the time series of the cumulative values of the unadjusted and industry-adjusted carbon premia in Fig. 4. Because different emission variables have different supports, we express the magnitudes in terms of unit standard deviation of each variable at each cross-section in time, so that all plots of the cumulative effect show comparable numbers in terms of economic significance. As can be seen in the figure, there are large positive cumulative returns for all measures of total emissions. The economic magnitudes of the effect become even larger once we factor in differences in industry exposures.

We next estimate the same cross-sectional regression model (1) replacing the level of emissions (LOG (Emissions TOT)) with the year-to-year growth in emissions (Δ(Emissions)). The results are reported in Table 8, Panel B. We find again a positive and statistically significant effect of the growth in emissions on stock returns. Interestingly, controlling for industry makes almost no difference when it comes to the effect of the growth in emissions. To allay any concern that our results may be driven by the correlation between emissions and size, we provide additional robustness tests in which we estimate univariate regression models with respective emission variables only, and regressions with emissions and size only. The results, reported in Table A.2 of the Online Appendix indicate that size is an important control when one considers the level of total emissions as a regressor but it is not as important in the model with the growth rate of emissions. Note also that ROE has a significant positive effect on stock returns under this specification (it is insignificant in the specification with emission levels). We attribute this to the fact that firms HHI, SALESGR, and EPSGR are measured as of time t to reflect the fact that all three may have a nontrivial contemporaneous effect on the level of emissions at time t.

with high emission growth likely also have higher earnings, which could result in higher stock returns (to the extent that the higher earnings outcome is unanticipated).

We also plot the time series of the cumulative values of the unadjusted and industry-adjusted carbon premia related to the growth in emissions in Fig. 5. All measures of emissions exhibit a steady rate of increase in the carbon premium over time.

Finally, we estimate the cross-sectional regression model in (1) for emission intensities. We report the results in Table 8, Panel C. There is no significant effect of emission intensity on returns for any of the three categories of emissions, whether we control for industry or not. The cumulative effect of emission intensity on the carbon premium, presented in Fig. 6, is also quite weak, with the exception of scope 2 for which we observe a slightly positive trend. Overall, these results reveal that there is a significant carbon premium with respect to the level of emissions, reflecting firms’ long-run risk exposure to carbon emissions, and a premium with respect to the growth in emissions, which capture the more short-term evolution of firms’ risk exposure to future emissions.

One open question with our analysis above is that we use carbon emission data in year t to explain monthly returns over the same year t. This could conceivably introduce a look-ahead bias. That is, under this specification we might unwittingly relate stock returns for some months in year t to emission data that might not yet have been available to investors. To address this question, we undertake the following robustness check. We relate monthly stock returns with a lag of respectively 0 to 12 months between the time when emissions are reported and the month when returns are realized.

Another interpretation of the results with lagged returns is that investors have limited attention and do not immediately absorb new information about carbon emissions at the firm level (Kacperczyk, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Veldkamp, 2016). In that case, carbon emissions for year t will be gradually reflected in returns over the year. An additional consideration is that investors obtain information about carbon emissions from multiple sources that are not all available at the same time. For example, a lot of firms disclose their emissions first to the CDP, data which then is merged into and combined with other sources by Trucost. Different information that is likely to be highly correlated with other information (given that all providers use the same data collection protocols) becomes available at different times. This is another reason why carbon emissions are only gradually reflected in stock returns.

We report the results in Table A.3. A remarkable pattern emerges from this analysis. Panel A1 reports the results for LOG (SCOPE 1 TOT). The coefficient is statistically significant for the first month (without industry fixed effects), remains significant at the 5% level until month 6 (with industry fixed effects), and is insignificant thereafter. Not surprisingly, it takes time for information about emissions to be reflected in stock prices, but eventually (after six months or so) this information appears to be fully absorbed. Essentially the same pattern is observed for the level of scope 2 and scope 3 emissions (with a somewhat faster (slower) integration of scope 2 (scope 3) emission information into stock prices), as the results in Panels A2 and A3 show. The same pattern is present for the growth in total emissions, as can be seen in panels B1, B2, and B3. However, emission intensity is nearly always insignificant, as we report in Panels C1, C2, and C3. The only visible exception is scope 1 emission intensity, which is significant at the 5% level in month 6 in the model with industry fixed effects. We conclude from this analysis that our results are not biased by a look-ahead effect.

Another possible explanation is that firms with higher emissions have also been exposed to unexpected positive value shocks. We explore this hypothesis by analyzing returns that strip out the effect of earnings surprises. Specifically, we subtract from the monthly stock returns the component that is realized on earnings announcement days and re-estimate the regression model in (1) with the adjusted returns. We report the results in Table 9 for the level of total emissions (Panel A), for the growth rate of emissions (Panel B), and for emission intensity (Panel C). We find no significant differential effect of earnings announcements on the carbon premium. Stocks with higher levels and growth rates of emissions still have higher returns, and emission intensity is still insignificant.

# 3.3. Carbon premium and risk factors

# Is the carbon premium linked to traditional risk factors?

To answer this question, we estimate the following time-series regression model using monthly data:

, (2)

where is the carbon return premium estimated from the cross-sectional Fama-MacBeth regression in Eq. (1); F is a set of factor-mimicking portfolios that includes MKTRF, HML, SMB, MOM, CMA, BAB, LIQ, NET ISSUANCE, and IDIO VOL. These factors have been widely used in many studies of asset prices. There are also economic reasons to believe that they could be meaningfully related to our carbon factor. Specifically, the first five factors correspond to the classic framework of Fama and French. In light of our results reported above, firm-level emissions are related to firm size and to firms’ growth opportunities; hence we include both the SMB and HML factors. The investment factor, CMA, controls for any differences in investments across firms. The market and momentum factors are standard controls in all time-series regressions. The BAB factor controls for the possibility that high carbon risk firms may be exposed to margin investments. The liquidity factor controls for possible differences in market liquidity among firms with different levels of carbon emissions, which could arise if some firms are not as actively traded as others due to ESG norm-based reasons. The net-issuance factor controls for any variation in capital structure and market timing by firm managers. Finally, the idiosyncratic volatility factor controls for the possibility that the measure of risk we capture may be idiosyncratic in nature. We calculate the standard errors of the coefficients using the Newey-West procedure with 12 lags to account for autocorrelation in error terms. Our coefficient of interest is , which measures the residual carbon premium, controlling for other risk/style factors.

# Panel A

Panel A in Table 10 shows the results for the carbon premium related to total emissions. In the odd columns, we report the unconditional carbon premium as a benchmark. In the even columns, we report results from regressions that add various factors MKTRF, HML, SMB, MOM, CMA, BAB, LIQ, NET ISSUANCE, and IDIO VOL. Comparing the odd and even columns for the respective scope categories of emissions, we find that the carbon premium remains statistically and economically significant after we adjust for differential factor exposures. However, the economic size of the premium is about 10%-20% smaller in magnitude. Overall, the regression intercepts from the cross-sectional return regressions are both economically and statistically significant in the presence of various risk factors.

# Panel B

Panel B shows the results for the carbon premium related to the growth rate in total emissions. We find again that the set of standard risk factors cannot explain the average value of the carbon premium for any of the emissions categories. This time, however, the difference in magnitudes across specifications is much smaller.

# Panel C

Panel C gives the results for emission intensity. Whether unconditionally or conditionally on the risk factors, we find no significant carbon premium.

Overall, our time-series regression results show that the carbon premium cannot be explained by known risk factors. This result reinforces the finding in Section 3.2 that the level of carbon emissions contains independent information about the cross-section of average returns.

# 3.4. The divestment hypothesis

An important possible explanation for the observed carbon premium could be under-diversification resulting from divestment and exclusionary screening of stocks with high carbon emissions by institutional investors implementing a sustainable investment policy. To the extent that some investors may shun companies with high carbon emissions, risk sharing would be limited, and idiosyncratic risk could be priced (e.g., Merton, 1987; Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009). If the extent of such divestment is high, one would expect to see significant pricing effects.

We test this possibility by looking at the portfolio holdings of institutional investors. Formally, we estimate the following pooled regression model:

. (3)

13

We consider ownership effects based on carbon intensity, the measure that is most aligned with explicit mandates imposed by socially sensitive asset managers. In the Online Appendix, Table A.4, we also present the results for the less commonly used measures of total emissions and growth in emissions. As these results confirm, these variables have no significant impact on institutional investor portfolios. The vector of controls includes LOGSIZE, PRINV, B/M, MOM, BETA, VOLAT, VOLUME, NASDAQ, and SP500. All regressions include year/month fixed effects. Also, carbon emissions tend to vary geographically, due to resource-driven firm locations. It is thus possible that the geographic location may also interact with ownership incentives. We test this idea by including in the ownership regression state fixed effects determined by the firm headquarters’ locations (in even columns). Our coefficient of interest is [missing value], which measures the degree of avoidance of firms with greater carbon emissions. We cluster standard errors at the industry and year levels.

# 3.5. Coarse Categorization

In Panel A of Table 11, we report the results for the aggregate institutional ownership measure. Columns 1 and 2 show the results for SCOPE 1 INT, respectively without and with state fixed effects. Both coefficients are negative and statistically significant at the 5% level. The economic effect of the divestment is relatively modest: a one-standard-deviation increase in SCOPE 1 leads to approximately a 1.3-percentage-point decrease in aggregate institutional ownership, which is about 6.3% of the cross-sectional standard deviation in ownership. In contrast, the coefficients are statistically insignificant for SCOPE 2 INT and SCOPE 3 INT, indicating that the exclusionary screens institutional investors apply in constructing their portfolios are entirely based on SCOPE 1 INT.

The institutional investor world pools a number of different constituencies with possibly different investor pressures. We conjecture that certain institutions, such as insurance companies, investment advisers, or pension funds, are more likely to face investor pressure, and thus they avoid high-emission companies, as opposed to mutual funds and hedge funds who are natural arbitrageurs. We test this hypothesis formally by dividing the institutional investors’ universe into six categories: banks, insurance companies, investment companies, independent advisers, pension funds, and hedge funds. For each category, we obtain their stock-level institutional ownership and estimate the regression model in (3) for each of them separately. Panel B reports the results broken down by investor category. We observe a strong cross-sectional variation in the ownership patterns. Insurance companies, investment advisers, and pension funds tend to hold less of the high scope 1 emission companies. At the same time, we observe positive, though weaker, ownership effects for banks, investment companies, and hedge funds, consistent with these groups being natural arbitrageurs. The divestment effects are economically large. A movement in SCOPE 1 INT from one standard deviation below the mean to one standard deviation above the mean, corresponding to a spread between low and high-emission firms leads to a reduction in ownership by 21%, 5%, and 4% of the cross-sectional standard deviation of ownership for investment advisers, insurance companies, and pension funds, respectively. In particular, given its large aggregate shares of stock holdings, the effect through investment advisers could lead to significant pricing effects. In sharp contrast to the results for SCOPE 1 INT, we observe that (with the exception of banks loading up positively on SCOPE 3 INT) all coefficients for the different investor types are small and statistically insignificant, which suggests that institutional investors do not seem to discriminate between stocks with regard to their scope 2 and scope 3 emission intensities.

Overall, institutional investors do significantly divest from firms associated with high SCOPE 1 INT. They do not screen companies based on the level of their emissions (or growth in emissions), even though the carbon premium is associated with these variables. They prefer to screen firms based on how efficiently they use fossil fuel energy and do not seem to be concerned about reducing their exposure to the level of carbon emissions per se. We conclude from these findings that, unlike for “sin” stocks (as shown by Hong and Kacperczyk, 2009), limited risk sharing caused by divestment cannot alone explain why we observe a return premium for companies with higher levels (and growth) of emissions.

It is often pointed out that only a handful of industries produce the most significant fraction of carbon emissions.14 The typical salient industries that are mentioned are oil & gas (GIC = 2), utilities (GIC = 65-69), and transportation (GIC = 19, 20, and 23). It is therefore natural to wonder whether our results are disproportionately driven by these sectors, and whether our cross-sectional carbon premium would become significantly smaller if we exclude these industries from our analysis.

In Table 12, we report the results for the subset of firms, excluding the sectors mentioned above. Panel A reports the results for total emissions, Panel B for the growth rate in emissions, and Panel C for emission intensity. Compared with the results in Table 8, we observe that, if anything, excluding these salient sectors strengthens the results on the firm-level carbon premium. These findings imply that there is a coarser categorization of companies by investors within the salient industries, where returns are less sensitive to differences in emissions across firms.

In Table 13, we report the results on institutional ownership when the salient high-CO2 industries are excluded. Consistent with Gabaix (2014), we find that coarse industry-level categorization drives our divestment results. Indeed, there is no significant divestment in the other industries. This is true in the aggregate as well as for the different categories of investors. It is as if investors decided to reduce their exposure to certain industries by divesting from some firms but holding on to the best in class in terms of scope 1 emission intensity in those industries. In Table A.5 of the Online Appendix, we provide additional evidence on this result with respect to levels and changes in emissions. We do not observe any divestment based on levels of emissions, but some divestment based on the growth of scope 2 and scope 3 emissions. This divestment is particularly strong for pension funds.

# 3.6. Investor awareness

The carbon premium in stock returns could also be affected by the changing awareness of investors about carbon risk. In particular, one would expect that periods with greater climate change awareness would have a higher carbon premium. We evaluate this hypothesis in two ways. First, we compare the estimated carbon premium before and after the Paris Agreement in 2015. Second, we impute carbon emissions in the 1990s based on their levels in 2005 and estimate the carbon premium over this decade and compare this premium to the one obtained over our sample period, when similarly imputing back carbon emissions based on the levels of emissions in 2017. Both tests offer complementary views on the role of changing investors’ attention. The first test allows us to assess the short-term impact of changing attention, while the second test is more suited for the long-term changes in attention.

The Paris Agreement possibly raised both the awareness of risks tied to carbon emissions and the prospect of regulatory interventions to limit carbon emissions. One could therefore expect that the carbon risk premium would increase after 2015 following the Paris Agreement. We test this hypothesis by estimating the regression model in (1) on the two sub-periods: 2005-2015, and 2016-2017.15 We report the results in Table 14. We find that indeed the premium associated with all three categories of emissions is larger during the 2016-2017 subperiod, especially for scope 1 and scope 2. This could be seen as evidence that investors care more about carbon risk following the Paris Agreement. However, an important caveat is that our sample increases after 2015, so that the difference in returns pre and post Paris could be attributed to the new firms that were added to our sample. We explore this possibility in the Online Appendix and indeed find in Table A.6 that the increase in return premium is mostly due to the addition of the new firms. We find that when we exclude the new firms, the carbon premium becomes insignificant in the two years following the Paris Agreement. The insignificance of the carbon premium does not necessarily mean that carbon risk is no longer priced after the Paris Agreement in 2015; it could be due to a weak statistical power given how noisy returns tend to be.

14 For instance, in a 2016 report, the International Energy Agency estimates that 39% of CO2 emissions come from electricity and heat production, 30% from transport, and 11% from industrial production (see https://www.iea.org/media/statistics/Energy_and_CO2_Emissions_in_the_OECD.pdf).

15 To enhance the statistical robustness of our results, we now cluster standard errors at the firm and year-month levels.

We further explore the cross-sectional variation of the effect of the Paris Agreement by examining whether the awareness that the Paris Agreement raised had a differential effect on the returns of firms with different exposures to carbon policy risk. We measure the exposures using our three measures of firm-level emissions. Our treatment sample is the subset of firms in the largest quartile of the distribution of firms sorted by the size of their carbon emission as of the end of 2014. We match these firms with a control group of firms with similar characteristics identified by two different techniques: the nearest neighbor and the Mahalanobis distance. The matching characteristics we use are the same as those we include in our return regressions. We report the results based on the nearest neighbor matching in Table 15. The results based on Mahalanobis matching are qualitatively similar.

To validate the quality of our matching, in Table A.7, we show, as an example, the balance test for the matched samples of treatment and control firms based on the scope 1 emission levels. We find that the two samples are not very different from each other along many firm-level dimensions. Notable exceptions are market capitalization, book-to-market ratio, return on equity, and property plant and equipment for which the differences are statistically significant, though not economically large. Importantly, the differences in market capitalization and PPE are expected given that the treatment sample is based on the size of firm emissions, which are strongly correlated with both characteristics. Next, we compare the returns of firms in the treatment and control groups in the one-year period around the Paris Agreement of December 2015. Formally, we estimate the following difference-in-differences regression model:

where TREAT is a generic indicator variable taking the value one for firms in the treatment sample and zero for firms in the control sample, and AFTER is an indicator variable equal to zero for the period 2015/05-2015/11 and equal to one for the period 2015/12-2016/05. We also include firm and year-month fixed effects in the regression. We estimate this model separately for each scope and emission measure. In the regressions, the sorts correspond to each scope measure, which then separately identify each individual treatment variable. Our coefficient of interest is e1, which measures the differential effect of the change on firms with high emissions and firms with low emissions.

In Panel A of Table A.7, we present the results for the level of total emissions. We find a strong and positive effect on returns based on scope 1 emissions, but no significant effects for the other two scopes of emissions. The effect is economically large, implying that the Paris Agreement resulted in an average increase in returns of more than 10.6% over the six-month period. In Panel B, we show the results based on changes in emissions. While the magnitudes of the results for scope 1 and scope 3 based on the model with industry fixed effects are fairly large (between 3.7% and 4.5%), they are statistically insignificant. In Panel C, we present the results based on carbon intensity. Surprisingly, we find a strong negative coefficient for scope 3 emissions. The effects for the other two scopes are small and insignificant. Overall, these results on the differential cross-sectional effects of the Paris Agreement are broadly consistent with our other results but their statistical significance is relatively small. Again, one of the reasons could be the relatively small statistical power of the tests, as returns are generally quite noisy. Another reason could be that the salient effects, such as Paris Agreement, take a longer time to materialize in investors’ beliefs.

To offer a longer-term perspective on the changing investors’ beliefs, we exploit the fact that climate change and carbon emissions were not yet salient issues in the 1990s. It is only in the last two decades, with the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere and the repeated record-breaking temperatures, that climate change has turned into a widespread concern. This naturally raises the question of whether stock returns were already affected by corporate carbon emissions in the 1990s. If information about firm-level emissions was scarce and/or investors did not pay attention to carbon risk, one would expect that the pricing effects we identify between 2005 and 2017 would be much smaller back then. Given that our carbon emissions data begins in 2005, we cannot evaluate this hypothesis directly. However, we can impute back the unobserved emissions data for each firm in the 1990s from the values we observe later on. In other words, since emission levels are highly autocorrelated and the cross-sectional variation in emissions is stable over time (see Fig. 3), it seems reasonable, as a first pass, to assume that the cross-sectional variation of emissions in the 1990s tracks closely that observed in our data.

Specifically, we make the assumption that each firm with stocks trading during the 1990s has an emission intensity equal to the first officially reported value in the 2005-2017 period. We then collect the time-series information on each company’s revenues for the 1990-1999 period and impute the total value of emissions for each firm by taking the product of the emission intensity coefficient and the firm’s time-varying sales. We thus obtain a panel of imputed total corporate emissions for 1990-1999. We do exactly the same for emissions over our sample period. That is, we take the emission intensity coefficient for 2017 and impute back total emissions over the 2017-2005 sample period by multiplying this coefficient with the firm’s sales year by year. This latter imputation has the additional benefit of adding imputed emissions to our sample for all the new firms added to our sample in 2016 and provides another robustness check of our findings.

Next, we estimate the regression model in (1) using the imputed emission values for both time periods and report the results in Table 16. The process of imputation is not suitable to obtain the variation in emission growth rates since changes in emissions would vary one to one with changes in revenues. We have therefore considered an alternative model in which we have fixed the growth rates at the first available reported value and used it for all dates in the 1990-1999 period. The results from this estimation, available upon request, indicate that again the carbon premium is insignificant. The results in Panel A for the period of our sample indicate that this imputation works and that there is a significant carbon premium associated with the imputed level of emissions for all three scope categories. Notably, the magnitude of the results is even stronger than for the reported emission data. In contrast, the results in Panel B for the 1990s indicate that there was no significant carbon premium over this period. This finding is consistent with the quite plausible view that investors did not yet internalize carbon risk over this time period, but began to do so in the last two decades, as reporting on climate change, the effects of global warming, technological progress in renewable energy, and political action to curb carbon emissions intensified.

# 3.7. Robustness

We have explored a number of alternatives that provide insight on the effects we document. We report the specific tables in the Online Appendix. Below, we briefly summarize the main findings in these tables.

First, we estimate the carbon premium excluding the period of the financial crisis, which we define as the period from August 2007 to July 2009. The reason for excluding the financial crisis is that during this period the level of emissions is artificially low because of the crisis and stock returns are highly volatile. As a result, the relation between stock returns and carbon emissions may be distorted by the observations from the crisis period. Broadly, we find in Table A.8 that excluding the crisis period does not affect our results in a major way.

Second, we explore the robustness of our results to the alternative GIC 6-digit industry classification. How much does this alternative classification affect changes in the estimates when industry fixed effects are included? Again, the results, reported in Table A.9, are broadly similar to those obtained under the finer Trucost industry classification. Third, we exclude the salient industries from our analysis of the carbon premium pre and post Paris Agreement. The results are reported in Table A.10. If anything, the increase in the size of the premium is more pronounced in the non-salient industries (with the exception, possibly, of scope 3 emissions).

Fourth, we split the sample into two categories of firms, those that report their emissions and those for which emissions are estimated, and contrast how the carbon premium varies across the two categories. The results are reported in Table A.11. The coefficient for the level of scope 1 emissions is slightly smaller and slightly less significant for firms that disclose their emissions than for firms that do not. This is not entirely surprising given that, other things equal, firms are more likely to disclose their emissions if their performance on that dimension is better. Alternatively, firms that go out of their way to disclose may also have taken steps to reduce their emissions.16 Overall, the carbon premium is larger and more significant for the firms that do not.

16 The magnitudes of the coefficients of the estimated emissions could also be affected by measurement error. In general, such measurement error leads to attenuation bias; irrespective of the direction of the bias our comparisons should be treated with caution in the absence of a systematic adjustment for such an error.

disclose their emissions for all categories of emissions and for both emission levels and the growth in emissions (with one exception for scope 3 emission levels).

Fifth, we estimate the premium associated with the level and intensity of all three categories of emissions added up together. This is to facilitate comparison with the results in Garvey, Iyer, and Nash (2018) and In, Park, and Monk (2019). As one might expect based on our results for the disaggregated emissions, there is a highly significant premium associated with the level of emissions, but not with emission intensity. The results are presented in Table A.12. Sixth, we also report how institutional investor portfolios are not underweight companies with high levels of emissions (or high growth rates) in Table A.4. If anything, institutional investors load up on scope 2 and scope 3 emission levels. This could be a mechanical effect of their exclusionary screening policies based on scope 1 emission intensity.

Seventh, we further report how institutional investor portfolios are affected by the level of emissions in the companies they hold outside the salient industries tied to fossil fuels. We report the results in Table A.5. Interestingly, institutional investor portfolios load up on all three scope emission levels in the non-salient industries. Again, this is likely the consequence of institutional investors’ exclusionary screening in the salient industries. If they hold less in these industries, they must hold more in other industries. Table A.13 also reports the exposure to emission levels of institutional investors’ portfolios in the salient industries. Here we observe that their portfolios do not exhibit a significant tilt away from or into firms with high emission levels (with the exception of scope 3 emissions, where they are significantly underweight).

Eighth, we explore how sensitive the carbon premium is to the addition of other firm characteristics besides size. Table A.2 reports the results. It turns out that, controlling for other firm characteristics such as B/M, PPE, leverage, etc. matters. Without these controls, there is no significant premium associated with the level of emissions; however, the growth in emissions remains highly significant). Note also that when we add industry fixed effects, adding size as a control or not affects results, with a significant premium associated with the level of scope 1 emissions appearing only when we control for size.

Ninth, we check the robustness of our ownership regressions with respect to outliers using the natural logarithm transformation. The results, in Table A.14, indicate that there is no significant difference compared to our baseline results in Table 8. Tenth, we estimate the carbon premium on only the subset of firms for which we have carbon emission data before 2016. The results are reported in Table A.15. Although the size of the premium is a little smaller, it is broadly in line with the one estimated on the full sample.

# 4. Conclusion

How is climate change affecting stock returns? This is a fundamental question for the burgeoning field of climate change and finance. It is also a fundamental question for policy makers who are seeking to enlist investors in the fight against climate change. We address this question by undertaking a cross-sectional stock returns analysis, with carbon emissions as a firm characteristic, and find robust evidence that carbon emissions significantly and positively affect stock returns. There is a straightforward link between climate change mitigation and the reduction in carbon emissions. Whether through the production of their goods and services, or through the use of their products, firms are differentially affected by policies to curb carbon emissions and by renewable-energy technology shocks. Our evidence suggests that investors are discerning these cross-sectional differences and are pricing in carbon risk. We also find that the carbon premium cannot be explained through a sin stock divestment effect. Divestment takes place in a coarse way in a few industries such as oil and gas, utilities, and automobiles, and is entirely based on scope 1 emission intensity screens. Notably, we find no carbon premium associated with emission intensity. Moreover, outside the salient industries where all the divestment takes place, we find a robust, persistent, and significant carbon premium at the firm level for all three categories of emission levels and growth rates.

MKTRF is the monthly return on the value-weighted stock market net of the risk free rate; HML is the monthly return on the portfolio long value stocks and short growth stocks; SMB is the monthly return on the portfolio long small-cap stocks and short large-cap stocks; MOM is the monthly return on the portfolio long 12-month stock winners and short 12-month past losers; CMA is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on conservative investment stocks and short on aggressive investment stocks; BAB is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low-beta stocks and short on high-beta stocks; LIQ is the liquidity factor of Pastor and Stambaugh; NET ISSUANCE is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on high-net-issuance stocks and short on low-net-issuance stocks. Net issuance for year t is the change in the natural log of split-adjusted shares outstanding from the fiscal yearend in t-2 to the fiscal yearend in t-1; IDIO VOL is the monthly return of a portfolio that is long on low idiosyncratic volatility stocks and short on high idiosyncratic volatility stocks. Panel D reports the ownership variables. IOi,t is the fraction of the shares of company i held by institutions in the FactSet database at the end of year t. IO is calculated by aggregating the shares held by all types of institutions at the end of the year, and then dividing this amount by shares outstanding at the end of the year. IO_BANKS is the ownership by banks; IO_INSURANCE is the ownership by insurance companies; IO_INVESTCOS is the ownership by investment companies (e.g., mutual funds); IO_ADVISERS is the ownership by independent investment advisers; IO_PENSIONS is the ownership by pension funds; IO_HFS is the ownership by hedge funds. PRINVi,t is the inverse of firm i’s share price at the end of year t; TOT VOLATi,t is the standard deviation of daily stock returns for company i over the one-year period; VOLUMEi,t is the average daily trading volume (in $million) of stock i over the calendar year t; NASDAQi,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is listed on NASDAQ in year t, and zero otherwise; SP500i,t is an indicator variable equal to one if a stock i is part of the S&P 500 Index in year t, and zero otherwise.

The dependent variable is RET. Our treatment sample is the subset of firms in the largest quartile of the distribution of firms sorted by the size of their carbon emission as of the end of 2014. We match these firms with a control group of firms with similar characteristics identified by the nearest neighbor method. The matching characteristics we use are the same as those in our return regressions. TREAT is a generic indicator variable taking the value one for firms in the treatment sample and zero for firms in the control sample, and AFTER is an indicator variable equal to zero for the period 2015/05-2015/11 and equal to one for the period 2015/12-2016/05. We estimate this model separately for each scope and emission measure. In the regressions, the sorts correspond to each scope measure which then separately identify each individual treatment variable. We also include firm and year-month fixed effects in the regression. All variables are defined in Table 1. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the firm and year/month level. All regressions for columns 4-6 include industry-fixed effects. We report the results for the natural logarithm of contemporaneous total emissions in Panel A; the results for the growth rate in firm emissions in Panel B; and the results for emission intensity in Panel C. ***1% significance; **5% significance; *10% significance.

Urbanization, Energy use, CO2 emissions, Development stages, STIRPAT model

Despite the relationship between urbanization, energy use and CO2 emissions has been extensively studied in recent years, little attention has been paid to differences in development stages or income levels. Most previous studies have implicitly assumed that the impact of urbanization is homogenous for all countries. This assumption can be questionable as there are many characteristic differences among countries of different levels of affluence. This paper investigates empirically the effects of urbanization on energy use and CO2 emissions with consideration of the different development stages. Using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model and a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries over the period 1975–2005, the findings suggest that the impact of urbanization on energy use and emissions varies across the stages of development. Surprisingly, urbanization decreases energy use in the low-income group, while it increases energy use in the middle- and high-income groups. The impact of urbanization on emissions is positive for all the income groups, but it is more pronounced in the middle-income group than in the other income groups. These novel findings not only help advance the existing literature, but also can be of special interest to policy makers and urban planners.

# 1. Introduction

Urbanization is a phenomenon of economic and social modernization. It is not only the process of transferring rural labor from an agricultural-based economy to urban areas where industrial and service sectors predominate, but also the process of the structural transformation of rural areas into urban areas. Through these complex processes, the world has undergone rapid urbanization in recent decades, with the world urban population increasing from 1.52 billion in 1975 to 3.29 billion in 2007 (UN, 2008). Further, the urban population is projected to double to about 6.4 billion by 2050. To support such unprecedented growth, additional urban infrastructure will inevitably be called for. This possibly causes more resource consumption, exerting additional pressure on the already fragile ecosystem. In 2006, cities consumed about two-thirds of global energy and produced over 70% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, even though only around half the world's population lived there (IEA, 2008).

The relationship between urbanization and various environmental issues, including energy use and emissions, has been studied extensively in recent years. Some researchers show that urbanization increases energy demand, generating more emissions (Cole and Neumayer, 2004; Jones, 1991; Parikh and Shukla, 1995; York, 2007). However, it remains unclear whether the impact of urbanization on energy use and CO2 emissions varies across the different levels of development or income. Further study with careful consideration of the different development stages is imperative.

the differences in development. Using a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries over the period 1975–2005, the findings show that the impact of urbanization on energy use and emissions varies across the different levels of development. These novel empirical findings not only help advance the existing literature, but also deserve greater attention from policy makers.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical background, literature review and hypotheses. Section 3 details the empirical model and methodology. Section 4 describes and discusses the results. Section 5 offers conclusions and policy implications.

# 2. Theoretical Background, Literature Review and Hypotheses

# 2.1. Theoretical Background

Although urbanization is often discussed in the context of economic modernization, it is a demographic indicator that increases urban density and transforms the organization of human behavior, thereby influencing household energy use patterns (Barnes et al., 2005). However, the extent to which urbanization affects national energy use and CO2 emissions has not been fully and clearly explained in a single theory. Instead, some possible impacts of urbanization on the environment are partially and separately discussed in three relevant theories: ecological modernization, urban environmental transition and compact city theories. The first theory focuses on impacts at the national level, while the others discuss impacts at the city level.

Ecological modernization theory emphasizes not only economic modernization but also social and institutional transformations in explaining the effects of modernization on the environment. In this theory, urbanization is the process of social transformation regarded as one important indicator of modernization. It is argued that environmental problems may increase from low to intermediate stages of development. However, further modernization can minimize such problems, as societies come to realize the importance of environmental sustainability, seeking to decouple environmental impact from economic growth through technological innovation, urban agglomeration, and the shift toward knowledge and service based industries (Crenshaw and Jenkins, 1996; Gouldson and Murphy, 1997; Mol and Spaargaren, 2000).

The urban environmental transition theory mainly discusses the types of urban environmental issues and their evolution. It suggests that urban environmental problems vary with respect to stages of economic development (McGranahan et al., 2001). Because of limited resources, low stages of development often face poverty-related environmental problems (lack of safe water supply and inadequate sanitation). However, as income levels rise, these problems gradually subside. The increasing wealth of cities is often accompanied by an increase in manufacturing activities, causing substantial industrial pollution-related issues (water and air pollution). Nonetheless, such problems decrease in wealthy cities as the result of improved environmental regulations, technological progress and structural change in the economy.

However, wealthy cities are often associated with consumption-related environmental issues. Consumption patterns and lifestyles of the wealthy cities tend to be more resource intensive than those of lower-income cities. As cities become affluent, demands for urban infrastructure, transportation and individual resource consumption rise. Consequently, consumption-related issues such as energy consumption and CO2 emissions become more prominent. The three types of urban environmental issues could occur simultaneously at the same development stage (Bai and Imura, 2000; Marcotullio et al., 2003). However, the dominant issues of each stage described by this theory seem plausible.

The compact city theory mainly discusses the environmental benefits of urban compaction. The theory argues that high urban density allows cities to exploit economies of scale for urban public infrastructure (e.g., public transport, schools and water supply), and reduces car dependency, travel distance, the transmission and distribution losses of electricity supply, decreasing energy consumption and CO2 emissions (Burton, 2000; Capello and Camagni, 2000; Jenks et al., 1996; Newman and Kenworthy, 1989). However, some critics argue that increasing urban density is likely to cause traffic congestion, overcrowding and greater air pollution, which will outweigh the claimed benefits of compact cities (Breheny, 2001; Rudlin and Falk, 1999). In turn, this may increase energy use and emissions. Without adequate urban infrastructure support, greater urban density can cause substantial urban environmental issues (Burgess, 2000).

# 2.2. Literature Review

The relationship between urbanization and various forms of environmental pressure, including energy consumption and CO2 emissions, has been extensively investigated in recent decades using various types of data and models at the national, city and household level. To start with, using a national level analysis with cross-sectional data, Jones (1991) derived a positive correlation between urbanization and energy use per capita, noting that while urbanization enabled cities to benefit from economies of scale in production, it increased transport energy use and energy use per unit of output. Using a STIRPAT model, York et al. (2003a,b) also found that urbanization positively affects national energy footprints and emissions. Ehrhardt-Martinez et al. (2002) examined the relationship between urbanization and deforestation rates in developing nations using the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) model. The results suggested that deforestation rates increase at the early stage of urbanization, but decline as urbanization advances. This curvilinear relationship was attributed to the effects of urban agglomeration and growing service sector dominance in urban areas.

In a time-series data context, Alam et al. (2007) investigated the impact of urbanization on CO2 emissions in Pakistan with a model similar to the STIRPAT, and found a positive link between urbanization and emissions. Liu (2009) also found that urbanization positively influences energy use, but that the magnitude of the influence is declining. Liu (2009) attributed this decreasing influence to improvements in industrial and technological structure and more efficient utilization of resources. Similarly, Holtedahl and Joutz (2004) suggested that urbanization increases residential energy consumption for two reasons. First, moving to urban areas increases household accessibility to electricity. Second, households that had access to electricity in rural areas may increase their energy consumption after moving to urban areas by using existing electric appliances and after the purchase of new items.

In a panel data context, Parikh and Shukla (1995) showed that urbanization increases per capita energy consumption, noting that urbanization affects energy use in three ways: first, by shifting energy use from traditional fuels to modern fuels, second, by increasing embodied energy consumption through goods and service demands, and third, via direct household and transport consumption. Using the STIRPAT model, similar evidence was obtained by York (2007), who further argued that even in the most modernized nations, urbanization contributes to the growth of energy use. Following a similar model, Cole and Neumayer (2004) found that urbanization increases CO2 emissions. On the other hand, Mishra et al. (2009) reported that the relationship between urbanization and per capita energy was negative in New Caledonia, but positive in Fiji, French Polynesia, Samoa and Tonga. Using the EKC model and OECD data, Liddle (2004) found that urbanization and population density negatively affect per capita road transport energy use, implying that populous and highly urbanized societies have less demand for personal transport.

In terms of analysis at the city level, Newman and Kenworthy (1989) examined the relationship between urban density and transport energy use using data on 32 cities in high-income countries, and found that high urban density is associated with less per capita transport energy use. Likewise, Chen et al. (2008) investigated the impact of urban compaction on household energy use using Chinese city data, concluding a negative link between urban density and per.

capita household energy consumption. Moreover, Dodman (2009) Concerning the relationship between urbanization and emissions, the found that per capita greenhouse gas emissions of several wealthy cities were significantly lower than their national average for two reasons. The first is that most of these cities have highly dense building forms with small average dwelling sizes. These require less energy to heat, light and cool than those in suburban or rural areas. The second reason is that these cities have extensive public transport systems with lower car ownership levels than the national average. Similarly, Dhakal et al. (2002) reported that per capita CO2 emissions were lower in cities at a higher development stage (Tokyo and Seoul) than in those at a lower development stage (Beijing and Shanghai).

# 3. Empirical Model and Methodology

# 3.1. Empirical Model

The impact of demographic and economic factors on the environment is largely postulated in the IPAT identity (I=PAT) proposed by Ehrlich and Holdren (1971). The equation denotes I as environmental impact, which is determined by a multiplicative combination of three factors: population size (P), per capita consumption (usually proxied by per capita affluence) (A) and the level of environmentally damaging technology or the impact per unit of economic activity (T). The value of T is often derived from the known values of I, P and A, and is equal to I/(PA) or I/GDP.

The IPAT model is a very simple and useful framework, yet has two limitations (Dietz and Rosa, 1994). First, it is only a mathematical identity and cannot be used directly to test hypotheses on the impact of each factor on the environment. Second, it simply assumes that the elasticities of environmental impact to population, affluence and technology are unitary. For instance, a 1% increase in per capita income increases environmental impact by 1%. This contradicts the EKC hypothesis, which exhibits an inverted U-shape on the income–environment relationship (World Bank, 1992).

The IPAT model was later reformulated in the STIRPAT model of Dietz and Rosa (1997), where I = aPibATidu. Here, a is the constant term of the equation, b, c and d are the parameters of A, P and T, respectively, u denotes the disturbance term and subscript i represents the unit of analysis. Importantly, unlike the original IPAT identity, multiple variables other than A and P that influence the impact per unit of economic activity can express T (York et al., 2003b). For instance, Martínez-Zarzoso et al. (2007) proxied T with the share of industry in GDP and energy intensity, while Shi (2003) employed the share of the industrial and service sectors in the economy as a proxy. As urbanization is one of the important factors influencing energy use and emissions, several studies included it in the STIRPAT model and estimated its impact on energy use, emissions and energy footprints (Cole and Neumayer, 2004; York et al., 2003a,b; York, 2007).

# 3.2. Methodology

We employ the STIRPAT model (I = aPibATidu) reformulated by Dietz and Rosa (1997), and add urbanization as an additional variable. After taking natural logarithms of both sides of the model and rearranging, we can write the empirical models for the panel data of total energy use and CO2 emissions as follows.

ln Energyit = a0 + a1 ln(Pit) + a2 ln(Ait) + a3 ln(INDit) + a4 ln(SVit) + a5 ln(URBit) + Yt + Ci + u1it (1)

ln CO2it = b0 + b1 ln(Pit) + b2 ln(Ait) + b3 ln(INDit) + b4 ln(SVit) + b5 ln(URBit) + b6 ln(EIit) + Yt + Ci + u2it (2)

where P denotes population size and A is per capita GDP. As in Shi (2003), in the energy use equation (Eq. (1)), T is proxied with two variables: the share of the industry (IND) and service sectors (SV) in GDP. In addition to these two variables, energy intensity is included in the CO2 emission equation (Eq. (2)). Note that the energy intensity variable cannot be included in Eq. (1) because it is measured by total energy use divided by GDP, containing part of the dependent variable.

URB denotes urbanization, a0 and b0 are the constant terms, and u1 and u2 are the disturbance terms for Eqs. (1) and (2), respectively. Y is a year dummy that captures the time-speciﬁc effect. This can capture the effects of changes in global energy prices and technological progress not proxied by T. It also helps remove possible cross-sectional dependence in the equations (Petersen, 2009). C is a country dummy used to capture the unobserved country-speciﬁc effect, namely geographic location and resource endowment, as these possibly affect energy consumption and emissions. Adding country and time dummies is a standard treatment for panel data analysis, helping minimize heterogeneity bias and problems with possible spurious regression (Wooldridge, 2007). Therefore, the previously discussed equations are robust against omitted variables, generating reliable estimates.

This paper estimates the impact of urbanization on energy use and emissions using a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries covering the period from 1975 to 2005, yielding 3069 observations. The sample is considerably larger in terms of countries and years when compared with many previous studies. To fully address the concern whether urbanization pressure on energy use and emissions differs across the different levels of income and to empirically test the arguments of the ecological modernization and urban environmental transition theories, we divide our estimation into two parts. First, we estimate the whole sample without consideration of different income levels. Second, we estimate the sample divided into three income groups, low-, middle- and high-income groups, based on country classifications in 2004 (World Bank, 2009). The low-income group consists of 23 countries, while the middle- and high-income groups consist of 43 and 33 countries, respectively (see Table A.1 in Appendix A).

The data on population, urbanization, GDP, the share of the industry and service sectors in GDP are mainly from the World Bank (2007). The GDP information was missing for some countries, but we filled it in with the data from IEA (2009b,c). The data on industry and services were also missing for a number of countries. Fortunately, we found the missing information in the United Nations online database (UN, 2009). The data on CO2 emissions and energy use are derived from the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2009a,b,c). The energy intensity and carbon intensity information is calculated using data from the World Bank (2007) and IEA (2009a,b,c). Table 1 provides a detailed description of the variables and the data sources used in this study.

To check whether the data used in this study are stationary or not, we performed four different but commonly quoted unit root tests in the current empirical literature for panel data. The first test was proposed by Levin et al. (2002) (hereafter LLC). The null hypothesis of this test assumes that there is a common unit root process and the autoregressive coefficient is identical across cross-sections. Conversely, the second test developed by Im et al. (2003) (hereafter IPS) allows the autoregressive coefficient to vary across cross-sections. The third and fourth tests proposed by Maddala and Wu (1999) and Choi (2001) (hereafter ADF and PP) share the same assumption as for the IPS test. Given the heterogeneity in the sample, the IPS, ADF and PP tests are more relevant in this study. However, we put more emphasis on the IPS test as the sample meets its asymptotic requirements (numbers of cross-sections are larger than numbers of years). The test results show that all the variables are stationary except for GDP and energy intensity. However, the two series became stationary after taking first differences (see Table A.2 in Appendix A). Another benefit from first differencing is that it helps reduce or even remove serial correlation (Wooldridge, 2007). We applied the autocorrelation test proposed by Wooldridge (2002) and the heteroskedasticity test.

# 4. Results and Discussion

# 4.1. Descriptive Analysis of the Main Variables

Fig. 1(a) and (b) illustrates urbanization levels, per capita energy use and emissions for the three income groups in 1975 and 2005. As shown, these vary across the income groups: the higher the per capita income of a country, the greater its urbanization level, per capita energy use and emissions. In 1975, the degree of urbanization was 72% in high-income countries, only 24% in low-income countries and 48% in middle-income countries. In addition, per capita energy use and emissions of the high-income group in 1975 and 2005 were also significantly higher than for the other income groups. In 1975, each person in the high-income group on average consumed about 3.6 tons of oil equivalents (toe) and generated over 9 metric tons of CO2, significantly greater than each person in the low-income group consumed (0.43 toe) and emitted (0.30 ton).

The figure also shows differential changes in urbanization levels, per capita energy use and emissions between 1975 and 2005 among the three income groups. Compared with the other groups, the middle-income group experienced a greater increase in its urbanization level, rising from 48% in 1975 to 65% in 2005. The growth in its per capita emissions was around 40%, slightly lower than the growth in its energy consumption (45%). Similarly, between 1975 and 2005, the per capita energy use of the high-income group increased by about 58%, while its per capita CO2 emissions grew only 37%. In contrast, in the low-income group, per capita energy use was nearly unchanged, whereas its per capita CO2 emissions increased approximately 23%.

Fig. 2 details the relative percentage changes in urbanization, population, energy intensity, CO2 emissions, energy use and CO2 intensity compared with the base year (1975 = 0). Note that the

changes in energy use and CO2 emissions plotted in Figs. 2 and 1 are different as the former employs aggregate data, while the latter uses per capita data. The most significant change in urbanization in 2005 was in the low-income group, while the least change occurred in the high-income group because of its high degree of urbanization.

Similarly, the changes in the energy use and CO2 emissions of the low-income group in 2005 were significantly larger than those of the middle- and high-income groups. The change in the energy use of the low-income group was nearly 180%, while in the middle- and high-income groups, it was about 147% and 58%, respectively. Between 1975 and 2005, the emissions growth of the low-income group was nearly 357%, whereas it was about 132% in the middle-income group and only 38% in the high-income group.

Over the period 1975–2003, while the energy intensity of the low-income group steadily declined below the year 1975 level, in the middle-income group, it fluctuated over time and then fell. Surprisingly, in the high-income group, it increased until 1988 and then started declining. However, it was still above the base year level. This is mainly due to the fact that this income group consists of several major oil exporting countries, largely influencing the group's average energy intensity.

# 4.2. Empirical Results and Discussion

Table 2 reports the estimated results for the whole sample, while Tables 3, 4 and 5 show the results of the low-, middle- and high-income groups, respectively. As the FD models (Models 4, 8, 12 and 16) are the preferred models, our main interpretations focus only on these models.

The estimated coefficients in the FD model (Model 4 listed in Table 2) are all statistically significant at the 5% level or lower, except for the coefficient of urbanization. The relationship between urbanization and energy use is positive but insignificant, whereas population size, GDP per capita and economic structure positively affect energy use. The elasticity of energy use to population growth is 1.23, while the elasticity to GDP per capita is 0.316. A 1% increase in the share of the industrial and service sector in the economy raises energy use by 0.069% and 0.049%, respectively.

However, the results of Models 8, 12 and 16 show that the impact of urbanization on energy use is statistically significant at the 10% level or lower, and differs across the various development stages. Surprisingly, a 1% increase in urbanization decreases energy use in the low-income group by 0.132%, while it increases energy use in the middle- and high-income groups by 0.507% and 0.907%, respectively. The positive link between urbanization and energy use is evident in several previous studies (Jones, 1991; Parikh and Shukla, 1995; York, 2007).

The effects of population growth, GDP per capita and economic structure on energy consumption are also heterogeneous across the different income groups. The elasticity of energy use to population change in the middle-income group is about 1.7, significantly greater than in the low- (0.601) and high-income groups (1.196). Similarly, the elasticity of energy use to changes in income in the middle-income group is 0.30, notably greater than in the low-income group (0.18), but slightly smaller than in the high-income group (0.376). The impact of the share of industrial activity in the economy on energy consumption is positive, but statistically significant for only the low- and middle-income groups. The contribution of the share of services in GDP to energy consumption is positive, but statistically significant for only the middle-income group.

The negative urbanization elasticity of energy use in the low-income group seems to support the argument of urban compaction. However, as many cities of this income group still lack basic public services, the negative elasticity is unlikely to be the result of economies of scale for public infrastructure. Rather, it could possibly be due to the effects of modernization, particularly the effect of improved access to modern forms of energy use. The findings are supported by Pachauri (2004) and Pachauri and Jiang (2008), who found that fuel switching from inefficient solid fuels to modern forms of energy use causes per capita household energy use in urban areas to be lower than in rural areas. It is evident that the share of biomass in total energy use in the low-income group significantly decreased from around 75% in 1975 to 66% in 2005 (see Fig. B(b) in Appendix B).

As described previously, further urbanization in the high-income group seems to increase rather than to decrease energy use. This supports the argument of the urban environmental transition theory that consumption-related issues are most pronounced in high-income countries. Unlike the other income groups, the high-income group uses much private and public infrastructure in supporting their urban population and urban economies. Constructing, maintaining and operating the infrastructure involve significant amounts of energy resources. Moreover, consumption patterns and lifestyles in cities of developed countries tend to be more resource intensive than in the cities of developing countries. High levels of energy use in the high-income group also reflect in Fig. 1(a).

Table 6 reports the results for the whole sample, whereas Tables 7, 8 and 9 show the results for the low-, middle- and high-income groups, respectively. As the FD models (Models 20, 24, 28 and 32) address all important econometric concerns, our main interpretations focus only on these models.

The estimated results of Model 20 (Table 6) are all statistically significant at the 5% level or lower, except for the coefficients of economic structure. The results show that population size, GDP per capita, urbanization and energy intensity positively influence emissions. A 1% increase in urbanization raises emissions by 0.447%, all other factors being equal. The elasticity of emissions to population growth is 1.125, indicating a moderately elastic relationship, while the elasticities of emissions to GDP per capita and energy intensity are approximately one, suggesting a unit elastic relationship. The coefficients for industry as percent of GDP and services as percent of GDP appear positive but statistically insignificant.

However, the results of Models 24, 28 and 32 indicate that the relationship between urbanization and emissions varies across the different stages of development. The urbanization elasticity of emissions in the middle-income group is 0.512, greater than in both the low- (0.43) and the high-income group (0.358). The effects of population growth, GDP per capita, economic structure and energy intensity are also heterogeneous across the different income groups. The elasticity of emissions to population change in the low-income group is about 1.75, significantly greater than in the middle-income group (1.228) and in the high-income group (1.122). Similarly, the impact of income and energy intensity on emissions in the low- and middle-income groups is larger than in the high-income group. These results are consistent with the findings by Martínez-Zarzoso et al. (2007) and Shi (2003). Like Model 20, none of the coefficients for economic structure in Models 24, 28 and 32 is statistically significant.

It should be noted that in the low-income group, the relationship between urbanization and energy use is negative, while the relationship between urbanization and emissions is positive. This phenomenon could occur as this income group shifts from traditional fuels (biomass) to fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), which are more efficient but may have more CO2 emissions. The share of coal and oil in their total energy use increased from 21% in 1975 to 24% in 2005 (see Fig. B(a) in Appendix B). Over the same period, their carbon intensity exhibited an upward trend as illustrated in Fig. 2.

Another point worth noting is that the impact of urbanization on energy use of the high-income group is greater than that of the middle-income group, whereas its urbanization elasticity of emissions is smaller than that of the middle-income group. This can possibly be attributed to structural change in energy use. The high-income group significantly decreased the share of coal and oil in their total energy use from around 71% in 1975 to only 56% in 2005 (see Fig. B(a) in Appendix B). The tendency of fuel usage switching toward low carbon intensive fuels (e.g., natural gas and nuclear energy) is shown in Fig. 2(c). The carbon intensity of the high-income group significantly declined over the period 1975–2005. The share of coal and oil in the total energy use of the middle-income group also declined. However, its carbon intensity did not decline as steadily as that of the high-income group. This could possibly relate to differences in their technological efficiency.

The impact of urbanization on emissions not only varies across the three income groups, but also appears greater in the middle-income group. This trend conforms to the argument of the ecological modernization theory that the process of modernization may cause substantial environmental issues. However, further modernization can reduce these problems. Despite different environmental indicators, the findings are in line with previous research by Ehrhardt-Martinez et al. (2002), who found an inverted U-shaped relationship between urbanization and deforestation rates. Fig. 3 summarizes the urbanization elasticities of energy use and CO2 emissions (derived from Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9).

# 5. Conclusion

Unlike previous studies, this paper investigated empirically the impact of urbanization on total energy use and CO2 emissions with consideration of different levels of development using the STIRPAT model and a balanced panel dataset of 99 countries over the period 1975–2005. The sample was divided into three different groups (low-, middle- and high-income groups), and they were separately analyzed. The results suggest that the effects of urbanization on energy use and emissions vary significantly across these income groups.

The search for a relation between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria and corporate financial performance (CFP) can be traced back to the beginning of the 1970s. Scholars and investors have published more than 2000 empirical studies and several review studies on this relation since then. The largest previous review study analyzes just a fraction of existing primary studies, making findings difficult to generalize. Thus, knowledge on the financial effects of ESG criteria remains fragmented. To overcome this shortcoming, this study extracts all provided primary and secondary data of previous academic review studies. Through doing this, the study combines the findings of about 2200 individual studies. Hence, this study is by far the most exhaustive overview of academic research on this topic and allows for generalizable statements. The results show that the business case for ESG investing is empirically very well founded. Roughly 90% of studies find a nonnegative ESG–CFP relation. More importantly, the large majority of studies reports positive findings. We highlight that the positive ESG impact on CFP appears stable over time. Promising results are obtained when differentiating for portfolio and nonportfolio studies, regions, and young asset classes for ESG investing such as emerging markets, corporate bonds, and green real estate.

Keywords: second-order meta-analysis; vote-count studies; financial performance; ESG criteria; business case

# Introduction

Close to 60 trillion US Dollars in assets under management – or 50% of the total global institutional assets base – are currently managed by Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) signatories (PRI 2015a). On the one hand, this development clearly demonstrates the commitment of financial markets toward environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria within investment decisions. However, on the other hand, far-reaching shifts of mainstream investors toward embracing sustainable investment practices remain rather slow (Reynolds 2014; Busch, Bauer, and).

Orlitzky 2015; PRI 2015b). Less than a quarter of investment professionals consider extra-financial information frequently in their investment decisions (EY 2015) and just about 10% of global professionals receive formal training on how to consider ESG criteria in investment analysis (CFA Institute 2015). For many, the business case for responsible investing seems not obvious (Feri 2009; Cohen et al. 2011; Riedl and Smeets 2015). Still, the question of how compatible ESG criteria are with corporate financial performance (CFP) has remained a central debate for practitioners and academics alike for more than 40 years.

Though there are many positive examples for the ESG–CFP relation, researchers often claim that results are ambiguous, inconclusive, or contradictory (Aupperle, Carroll, and Hatfield 1985; Griffin and Mahon 1997; Rowley and Berman 2000; van Beurden and Gössling 2008; Hoepner and McMillan 2009; Revelli and Viviani 2015). Scholars and practitioners are, in particular, undecided about the general effect including its measurement and durability (Barnett 2007; Devinney 2009; Wood 2010; Orlitzky 2011; Borgers et al. 2013; Orlitzky 2013; Reynolds 2014; Authers 2015). Thus, there is an ongoing debate about the role and the impact of the financial sector on the natural environment and society (Weber 2014). In order to derive a more comprehensive picture, several review studies summarize primary ESG–CFP studies. Yet, all these first-level review studies provide an incomplete picture. This study is the first effort to provide aggregated evidence based on more than 2000 empirical studies that have been released since the 1970s (see Figure 1).

We chose a two-step research method to analyze existing review and primary studies. First, we include findings from so-called vote-count studies. Vote-count studies count the number of studies with significant positive, negative, and nonsignificant results and “votes” the category with the highest share as winner (Light and Smith 1971). These studies provide interesting insights, but are less sophisticated from a methodological point of view. The shortcomings are well documented in the literature. 1 Second, we aggregate the findings of econometric review studies – so-called meta-analyses – to derive a second-order meta-analysis.

In total, 60 review studies – both vote-count studies and meta-analyses – with a gross number of 3718 underlying studies on the empiric relation between ESG criteria and CFP provide the starting point for our second-level review study.2 When adjusted for overlaps, this figure reduces to a net number of more than 2200 unique studies. This still represents a dataset, which is 35 times.

larger than the average of analyzed primary studies in prior review studies. In this study, we explain both systematic methods of summarizing extant research and present a research symbiosis of vote-count studies and meta-analyses in the spirit of a best-evidence synthesis (Slavin 1986).

Through analyzing what is by far the most comprehensive dataset on existing ESG–CFP research to date, we find that the business case for ESG investing is empirically well founded. Investing in ESG pays financially. Furthermore, we highlight that the positive ESG impact on CFP is stable over time. Based on the data, we are able to derive conclusions for portfolio and nonportfolio studies, 3 different asset classes, regions, and categories of E, S, and G. Particularly promising results are obtained when we differentiate between regions, nonportfolio studies, and asset classes other than equities.

# Data

Since the earliest review of vote-count ESG–CFP studies (Aldag and Bartol 1978), the studies providing secondary analysis of this relation has risen considerably, including both academic and numerous additional practitioner papers. The growth in number of ESG–CFP research publications has been particularly tremendous since the beginning of the 1990s. Based on our sample, we find that at least 2200 empirical ESG–CFP studies exist.

# Search

For our analysis, only academic studies – regardless if they are working papers, published journal papers, or written for a commercial audience – were considered. Review papers that did not provide quantitative summaries of their findings were not included in our sample. Besides ancestry research and expert opinion, all relevant scholar databases and publisher sites were searched: Academy of Management Journals, ABI/Inform, Ebsco, Emerald, Google Scholar, Oxford Journals, Sage, Science Direct, Sprinker Link, and Web of Science. We also searched for nonpublished material on Econbiz, NBER, Repec, and SSRN. The keyword search combinations included the three components of E, S, and G and its abbreviations. In particular, we used the search terms environment(al) (performance), social (performance), responsib(le/ility), sustainab(le/ility), human capital, (corporate) governance – all in relation to (corporate) financial performance.

The first 100 hits of each single database and key word query, sorted by relevance, were further processed. Within this pre-filtered results we then searched for the terms meta, review, literature, overview, analysis, study/ies, and examination. Together with the expert opinion studies, this yielded a narrower sample of 149 studies, which were analyzed in more detail by abstract or full paper. Single study designs, narrative reviews without clear tables/explicit summary results, and review studies without relevant ESG–CFP categorization were excluded. We applied a definition of ESG that reflects the exemplary list of variables of Clarkson (1995), Wood (2010), and the investment approaches in GSIA (2013). We did not differentiate whether the motives for ESG performance of the firm are for altruistic or strategic reasons (McGuire 1969; Baron 2001; McWilliams, Siegel, and Wright 2006). CFP measures were defined as accounting-based performance, market-based performance, operational performance, perceptual performance, growth metrics, risk measures, and the performance of ESG portfolios (Cochran and Wood 1984; Orlitzky and Benjamin 2001; Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes 2003; Peloza 2009). We also considered specific parts of a study (Viviers and Eccles 2012; Mayer-Haug et al. 2013; Stam, Arzlanian, and Elfring 2014) when its focus was not entirely on the ESG–CFP relation – provided a vote-count estimate or effect size calculation was possible. In case of different versions of a review study, the latest version – or ideally, the published version – remained in our sample. All studies were required to be available in electronic format. The cut-off date for study inclusion was online availability until December 2014.

This table displays all considered vote-count studies for the analysis. Meta-analytical studies with nontransferable or nontransparent effect sizes that nonetheless allow a vote-count analysis were included in the vote-count studies sample as well. Focus “S” and “E” denote a Social (S) or Environmental (E) focus. For studies with combined E and S focus, the order of S and E indicates the relative weight of S vs. E. The labeling “E, S, G” indicates no relative weight within groups. The number of primary studies in each vote-count analysis is denoted N. For vote-count studies with transparent vote-count on primary study, the share of findings is calculated based on this primary information. For all other cases, the reported summary results of the vote-count reviewers are used.

In total, we identified 35 vote-count studies (Table 1) and 25 meta-analyses (Table 2) which combine results from 3718 (gross) primary studies of which 1816 studies stem from vote-count studies and 1902 from meta-analyses. All studies were scaled with a unique identifier in the format author 1, author 2, … , author i (year). Different review author citations formats, citations years of study versions, and author typing errors were normalized. All available statistical

This table displays all considered meta-analyses for the analysis and includes the number of primary studies in each meta-analysis and the corresponding number of observations. Amplifications on the original reported number of included primary studies have been made, if not the entire sample was used. For four meta-analyses not all originally reported number of studies could be verified through data in the provided appendix and for three studies a condensed study set was used. The gross number of studies therefore decreases from 2091 to 1902 studies. Focus “S” and “E” denote a Social (S) or Environmental (E) focus. For studies with integrated S and E focus, the order of S and E indicates the relative weight of S vs. E studies. The indices (a) and (b) for the uncorrected effect size r indicate the source of the effect size in case, it was modified from the originally stated results: (a) transformed from d/g in r and (b) derived from stated corrected study results with either a meta-analysis provided individual attenuation factor or a calculated artifact attenuation factor of 0.72.

Summary information of review studies and all information reported on primary study level were imported and normalized for further statistical analysis. Not all primary studies were made transparent by the review authors. Eight review studies containing 929 primary studies (25.0% of the sample) were not identifiable on primary level. This meant that the results were included in the summary effects, but no further analysis on primary study level was possible. Within the remaining uniquely identifiable 2789 (gross) primary studies, the overlap within review studies was subsequently accounted for. The resulting net number of identifiable unique primary studies was n = 723 for the vote-count studies and n = 1214 for the meta-analyses. Of these, 259 studies overlap within the two review approaches – which brought the final number of unique identifiable primary studies in the sample to n = 1678. Those 259 overlapping studies remained within the vote-count studies and meta-analyses sample as separation to one or the other review approach was not possible without losing data granularity.

Based on our sample of unique identifiable studies (n = 1678) and the number of nontransparent studies (n = 929), we estimated that at least 550 studies need to be added for a more complete estimate of the overall number of existing empirical studies on ESG–CFP published since the 1970s. This estimate was adjusted for the various overlaps within the vote-count studies and meta-analyses sample.

# Methods

Two different ways for aggregation of the primary and secondary study results are applied, each with different calculation methods depending on the context. For comparability between results in the vote-count studies and meta-analyses, we compute distributions of outcomes and correlation effect sizes. Besides aggregated summary effects, we provide further fine-grained analysis on sub-group level. Depending on data availability in vote-count studies and meta-analyses, an analysis for different asset classes, regions, categories of E, S, and G as well the relation over time is conducted. When both vote-count studies and meta-analyses offer this information, the more comprehensive primary study sample is chosen. When the sub-sample stems from vote-count studies, the analysis focuses on the distribution of outcomes; when the sub-sample stems from meta-analyses, the focus is on effect sizes.

Raw correlations, corrected correlations, sample sizes as well as corresponding variances, standard errors, confidence interval (CI), and credibility interval (CrI) have been extracted from the original meta-analyses as far as possible for further calculations. If necessary, some of the effect sizes and variances were transformed or derived for the calculation of a second-order meta-analysis.

# Calculation of distributions

# Vote-count studies

Distributions of positive, negative, neutral, and mixed outcomes are calculated for vote-count studies based on the results of the gross study sample and the net study sample. Within the gross study sample, it is possible that the same primary study is analyzed multiple times by different review study authors who may interpret each study differently. These interpretations are treated as independent study outcomes – no further adjustments are made. When a primary study is analyzed by more than one review author, the net study sample is adjusted for this constraint and different review authors’ interpretations are harmonized. On average, every unique primary study in the vote-count sample is analyzed by 1.8 review authors. To decide on the overall interpretation per unique study, a binomial test with three equally probable outcomes is applied (positive, neutral, and negative). A probability of greater than .95 served as cut-off point to determine the final interpretation for the study. If no clear positive or negative assignment was possible, the study is classified as neutral and/or mixed.

# Meta-analyses

Vote-count reviewers provide an assessment of the extent to which an observed relation in a primary study is a significant outcome. When undertaking a meta-analysis of primary studies, this assessment is performed by the second-level reviewer. In order to adjust for significance of the results, we employ a 95% CI and 95% CrI based on the determined meta-analytical variance in the n = 25 meta-analyses. We calculate the 95% CI via the determined standard error (SE) for attenuated (r) and disattenuated (p) results.

SEr = √ns = √∑i2ri and SEp = √np2

CIL = 0 + 1.96(SEr/p) and CIU = 0 + 1.96(SEr/p)

The 95% CrI is then calculated via the standard deviation of the attenuated and disattenuated correlations.

SDr = √ns = √∑i2ri and SDp = √np2

CrIL = 0 + 1.96(SDr/p) and CrIU = 0 + 1.96(SDr/p)

The true variance for *r (the meta-analytical mean of attenuated correlations) is s2r = r and the corresponding variance for p (the meta-analytical mean of disattenuated correlations) is s2p*. As we are interested in the degree of significant positive and negative results, we place the intervals around zero instead of the meta-analytical mean. The resulting distributions may appear unusual on first glance as they define results significantly different from zero. The calculation is also conducted for the uncorrected and corrected correlations in the 551 primary studies, which possess transparent effect size data. We apply the same corresponding intervals that are utilized for the set of meta-analyses. Finally, we determine the number of studies that are above and below the intervals, categorize them as positive or negative and put them in relation with the sample size. All studies within the interval are classified as neutral.

# Calculation of effect sizes

# Vote-count studies

Even though vote-count studies usually do not report effects sizes like standardized mean differences (d/g) or correlations, it is possible to approximate them with the provided data. Methods have been introduced during the time when broader application of meta-analytical techniques were being developed (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hedges and Olkin 1985) and were further refined in the 1990s (Bushman 1994; Bushman and Wang 1995). The effect size *r is determined by calculating the ratio of p0 (r), which divides the number of positive studies by the sum of positive and negative studies, and by putting it in relation with the corresponding number of studies n. The estimation for the correlation coefficient r of a single vote-count study is subsequently determined through linear extrapolation based on the correlations coefficients provided (Hedges and Olkin 1985, 63ff). In a final step, the estimated correlation factors per vote-count study are sample-size weighted and aggregated to an overall estimation of the average correlation r* for the vote-count sample.

# Meta-analyses

First-order meta-analytical results for the sample of primary studies are calculated with the Hunter–Schmidt approach (Hunter, Schmidt, and Jackson 1982; Hunter and Schmidt 2004). The approach is used by more than 80% of meta-analyses in management research (Aguinis et al. 2011). It is similar to the second-order meta-analytical methodology which applies a fully random effect model.

All other average effect sizes and summary statistics of the 25 meta-analyses are determined with Schmidt and Oh’s method for second-order meta-analysis (Schmidt and Oh 2013). A second-order meta-analysis combines a number of methodologically comparable and independent first-order meta-analyses. It allows knowledge aggregation across a tremendous set of primary studies. Such a meta-analysis sample is potentially closer to a complete set of studies in certain research fields and allows for robust generalizations. Apart from the efficient aggregation of huge datasets, the method is statistically superior to other approaches for summarizing first-order meta-analyses. Conventional approaches will most likely provide inaccurate estimates of the true mean effect size and are prone to second-order sampling errors in the variances across all meta-analyses. The approach chosen considerably reduces the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta-analyses and allows a better estimation of the true (nonartifactual) variance across these mean effect sizes (Schmidt and Oh 2013). Because of the considerable number of first-order meta-analyses in our sample which make use of artifact distribution correction, we calculate our results with the artifact distribution approach of Schmidt and Oh.

In order to differentiate whether correlations and corresponding variance are first-order (based on extracted primary studies) or second-order (aggregated vote-count studies or meta-analyses), we add one or two lines above letters for attenuated correlations r and disattenuated correlations p. The applied circumflex accent indicates that the values in the meaning of psychometric meta-analysis are estimates of the parameters, not the parameters themselves (Schmidt and Oh 2013; Schmidt and Hunter 2015, 229). Correlations containing lines above the letter but not marked with a circumflex are meta-analytical averages but are not determined using a psychometric meta-analysis.

# Results

Figure 2 displays our summary of findings: approximately 90% of studies find a nonnegative ESG–CFP relation, of which 47.9% in vote-count studies and 62.6% in meta-analyses yield positive findings with a central average correlation level in studies of around 0.15. The following paragraphs discuss the findings in more detail.

|share of positive findings|share of negative findings|weighted correlation level r in studies|
|---|---|---|
|62.6%|6.9%|0.146|
|47.9%|8.0%|0.150|

# Summary effects: distributions

# Vote-count studies

In a first step for the analysis of distribution results, all 1816 vote-count studies in the gross sample are treated as unique studies without adjusting for overlap among the vote-count studies. The overall weighted share of positive findings in the sample is calculated at 48.2%. In 41.0% of all results, the findings lead to neutral (23.0%) or mixed findings (18.0%). Just 10.7% of all analyzed studies exhibit a negative ESG–CFP relation.

In a second step, we account for the amount of nondisclosed and overlapping studies among the gross number of 1816 studies. The transparent studies are netted and in case that the first-level reviewer assessments differ, the findings are synthesized with a binomial test. The additional check does not meaningfully change the distribution of the positive and neutral findings (47.9% and 22.5%, respectively). However, a proportion of the negative findings cannot be considered statistically significant anymore if two or more reviewer interpretations are synthesized with a binomial test. The share of negative findings in the sample decreases to 6.9% of studies. Instead, the share of mixed results increases to 22.7%. Either way, depending on which of the two approaches (unadjusted gross studies/net studies adjusted with binomial test) is applied, close to 50% of all analyzed studies in the vote-count sample find a positive relation and around 10% a negative one. The small distribution difference in the results is explained by a slightly more comprehensive overall sample and the net approach for study interpretation when more than one reviewer analyzed the same primary study.

# Meta-analyses

Out of the 25 meta-analyses in the sample, just one study displays a summary effect size that has a negative ESG–CFP correlation – albeit very close to zero (Revelli and Viviani 2015). The sample size adjusted share of absolute positive correlation findings in meta-analytical summary effect for the 1902 studies stands with 95.8% considerably higher than in vote-count studies. However, this number is not adjusted for statistical significance. If we apply the 95% CI and 95% CrI, for the meta-analytical summary effects and the number of transparent primary studies, the figures change accordingly.

|For the 25 meta-analyses, the share of positive findings is|For the 25 meta-analyses, the share of positive findings is|

This table outlines the results of the distribution analysis of positive, negative, and neutral results in meta-analyses and in dependency of different correlation intervals. Whereas CI indicates the confidence interval and CrI the credibility interval.

Reduced to 74.9% (95% CrI, attenuated results). However, the share of negative results remains at 0%, as the lowest effect in the 25 meta-analyses is –0.003. A quarter (25.1%) of the sample effect sizes is within the CrI and is correspondingly classified as neutral results.

To eliminate potential positive biases in these meta-analytical summary effects, we also drill down to the primary study level and the sample of 551 studies. The share of studies with significant positive correlations is reduced to a minimum of 62.6% (95% CrI, attenuated results) with a maximum percentage of negatives as high 14.5% (95% CI, disattenuated results). An attenuated correlation level (interval) above 0.141 would be needed to bring down the percentage of positive correlations to the level in the vote-count studies of 47.9%. This cut-off is close to the population unweighted average correlation of 0.159.

# Summary effects: correlations

# Vote-count studies

Next, an approximation of the correlation effect size in vote-count studies based on the vote-count method of Hedges and Olkin (1985, 47ff) is conducted. The weighted average correlation rv= in all vote-count studies is calculated at 0.146. The corresponding p-value of <.001 indicates a correlation factor highly significant and different from zero. The additional check for statistical power (Cohen 1988; Faul et al. 2007) reveals that for the determined rv= and the corresponding number of n, the chance of a Type II error is close to zero.

# Meta-analyses

For reasons of comparability with the vote-count effect size estimate rv=, we compute the attenuated sample-size weighted average correlation for the 25 meta-analyses. The calculated correlation rm= is 0.118. The p-value of similarity of rm= and r= is notably high at 0.638. This means vote-count studies and meta-analyses determine statistically comparable results for the ESG–CFP relation. However, generalizing this finding for both methods universally may not be appropriate due to the almost independent samples containing few overlaps and very different variance levels.

Next, we calculate the first-order meta-analytical averages as both uncorrected and corrected parameters for the transparent sub-sample of 551 primary studies. The correlation ri is determined at 0.119 and pi at 0.169. The meta-analytical second-order effect size for the 25 meta-analyses.

combining 1902 gross studies reveals a correlation of ri = 0.108 and for the corrected effect size pi = 0.150. Worth mentioning is that the value for the vote-count effect size rv = 0.351 is statistically not different from the first- and second-order meta-analytical results (minimum p difference to ri). Even though the vote-count technique is a rough estimate based on simplified assumptions, it nonetheless yields surprisingly comparable estimations of the ESG–CFP relation compared to the sample of meta-analyses aggregated with the method for second-order meta-analysis – at least for our setup.

The p-values for all of our meta-analytical means are below .01 and indicate a statistical highly significant positive deviation from zero. In a similar manner, the 95% CrI of 0.058–0.242 for pi is another indicator of the positive nature of the ESG–CFP relation. Moreover, the control for statistical power of these values reveals very robust results, with a Cohen’s power for all figures above 0.8 and in four cases close to 1.

# Portfolio studies and nonportfolio studies

All previous vote-count and meta-analysis effects contain a blend of nonportfolio and portfolio studies. Making this differentiation is important as aggregated firm performance in virtual portfolios and financial products such as mutual funds or indices may deviate from primary firm data. Several primary portfolio studies and corresponding reviews report an abnormally low level of positive findings. And vice versa, a high level of mixed findings, compared to nonportfolio studies (Bauer, Koedijk, and Otten 2005; Peloza 2009; Kleine, Krautbauer, and Weller 2013; Revelli and Viviani 2015). In order to differentiate between portfolio and nonportfolio effects, we deconstruct all distributions and summary effect sizes with sufficient sample size in both blocks of study groups.

The relevance of this distinction becomes apparent when looking at the vote-count studies. The share of positive results in the n = 155 identifiable portfolio-related studies shrinks.

This table depicts first-order and second-order meta-analytical results. Attenuated correlations are marked as r and disattenuated correlations as p. The number of lines above letters indicates the first- or second-level nature of the effect size. The additional circumflex accent indicates psychometric meta-analytically effect sizes. Correlations not marked with a circumflex are meta-analytical averages but not determined with psychometric meta-analysis. rv is the sample-size weighted second-level effect size in vote-count analyses and rm the sample-size weighted second-level average effect size in meta-analyses. ri and p are the second-order meta-analytical attenuated and disattenuated averages. The deviation of all effect sizes from ri and p are the attenuated and disattenuated first-level effects sizes in transparent primary studies, and s2 is the estimated true variance for ri and p. Power 0.05 is Cohen’s power with α = 0.05 zero is tested for significance. For the second-order meta-analytical correlation means pi and ri CI L/CI U symbolize the 95% CI and CrI L/CrI U the 95% CrI. L indicates the lower and U the upper bound of the interval. Fail-Safe N is Rosenthal’s (1979, 1991) statistic to detect potential publication bias in meta-analyses. Fail-Safe N states the number of (future) studies with null results, until the effect size loses its significance level. A level above 5*n + 10 for Fail-Safe N is considered unlikely to assume publication bias within studies. This can be ruled out. The significance thresholds for p-values are ***p < .01.

ESG–CFP relation in vote-count studies in dependence of portfolio- and nonportfolio sample.

Considerably (15.5%) in comparison to nonportfolio-based studies (56.7%). Studies with neutral or mixed findings increase proportionately in portfolio-based studies and constitute nearly three quarters. The share of negative studies increases marginally compared to nonportfolio studies (11.0% vs. 5.8%) (Figure 4).

Comparable results are found when all portfolio-focused vote-count studies are separately analyzed based on estimated effect sizes. The studies exhibit a negative correlation rv(p) = -0.061 in comparison to the 30 primarily nonportfolio-focused vote-count studies with rv(non-p) = 0.177. The difference between both groups is highly significant (Table 5). These conclusions are supported when the first-level meta-analytical results in the transparent primary studies are deconstructed. The differences in correlations are not so pronounced, nonetheless significant (Table 5). This distinct deviation of portfolio and nonportfolio findings is examined in more detail in the “Discussion” section.

# Sub-effects in asset classes

Aside from the overall distribution of results and correlation factors in vote-count studies and meta-analyses, the data allow for examinations of differences in asset classes (D’Antonio, Johnsen, and Hutton 1997; Bhojraj and Sengupta 2003; Eichholtz, Kok, and Quigley 2010) – although with limited availability of nonequity classes. In a sub-sample consisting of 751 gross and 334 net studies within the vote-count sample 87.1% analyze equity-linked relations.

In contrast, nonequity asset classes both for bonds and real estate display a considerably higher share of positive findings over equities. More than two-thirds of studies uncover significant positive performance relations to ESG criteria. The share of positive votes for the 36 analyzed bond studies stands at 63.9% – with 13 neutral or mixed findings (36.1%). The relatively young research field of green real estate studies is reflected with seven studies in the total sample. Five studies (71.4%) find a positive and the other two a neutral relation (Figure 5).

# Sub-effects in ESG categories

A key question is whether any of the three ESG letters may have a dominating effect on CFP. Some meta-analyses find significant positive relations for corporate environmental performance and CFP (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat, Guenther, and Hoppe 2014). Human capital-focused meta-analyses (Combs et al. 2006; Crook et al. 2011; Rosenbusch, Brinckmann, and Bausch 2011) also find highly significant positive correlations. Various review studies on multifaceted corporate governance aspects and its relation to CFP exist and also support a positive relation (Dalton et al. 1999; Gillan and Starks 2007; Love 2010). However, not all of the E-, S-, and G-specific findings are free from ambiguity and no large-scale comparison between the subgroups has been undertaken yet.

For our sample of vote-count studies with identifiable ESG categories in 644 studies, we determine a relatively even positive relation for E, S, and G. The highest proportion is found in G with 62.3% of all cases. Governance-related aspects, on the other hand, demonstrate also the highest percentage of negative correlations with 9.2%. If the share of negative findings is deducted from positive ones, environmental studies offer the most favorable relation (58.7–4.3%). Studies with a social focus show 55.1% (5.1%) positive (negative) outcomes, hence the weakest relation.

Figure 6. E, S, and G categories and their relation to CFP (vote-count studies sample), n = 644 net studies.

When reviewing studies with various combinations of ESG criteria, 35.3% report positive (respectively 7.1% negative) findings. The downside bias primarily arises from a high proportion of portfolio-based studies in this section (39.1%). If all these studies were excluded, the positive (negative) rate stands at 51.7% (4.8%) which is nonetheless lower than pure E, S, and G approaches (Figure 6).

# Sub-effects in regions

Some studies have analyzed potential differences in the ESG–CFP relation across regions. Though findings are far from consistent, some hypothesized that the ESG–CFP relation across countries is particularly affected by a higher humane orientation (del Mar Miras-Rodríguez, Carrasco-Gallego, and Escobar-Pérez 2015). Others find that the ESG–CFP relationship for US assets is significantly higher compared to non-US assets (Allouche and Laroche 2005; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013). In contrast, a few researchers also discover significantly higher effects for studies conducted in the rest of the world (Albertini 2013; Golicic and Smith 2013).

We detect two main patterns in the data based on 843 gross studies with disclosed regional identifier that are netted for a final sample of 402 studies. First, developed markets excluding North America exhibit a smaller share of positive results. This contrast is most apparent between North America (42.7% positive) and developed Europe (26.1% positive). Developed Asia/Australia possess a positive share of 33.3%, though with the largest share of negatives as well at 14.3%. The total sample excluding North American stands at 27.8% positive share. A check of the underlying studies reveals a larger share of portfolio-based studies within the European and Asian/Australian sample that potentially biases the data. However, when omitting all portfolio studies for the developed market samples, the positive ratio for North America increases to 51.5%, and for Europe and Asia/Australia combined to 45.6%. This implies that the previous gap between the two samples shrinks considerably – from 14.9 to 5.9 percentage points.

Second, the Emerging Markets sample shows, with 65.4%, a considerable higher share of positive outcomes over developed markets. Excluding the proportion of portfolio studies, the ratio increases further to 70.8%. Based on 52 single studies in Emerging Markets solely focused on equity-linked studies, the spread to developed markets is considerable (Figure 7).

# ESG effect over time

The question has been raised of whether the ESG–CFP relation is stable over time (Grifﬁn and Mahon 1997; Borgers et al. 2013). Theoretically, the increasing amount of UN PRI signatories and, presuming an increasing ESG awareness within investment strategies, a decreasing ESG alpha (shrinking correlations over time) would be expected due to learning effects in capital markets.

# Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment

stakeholder issues also lead to changing ESG–CFP patterns over time present a fuzzy picture (Pavie and Filho 2008; Rubera and Kirca 2012; Albertini 2013; Endrikat, Guenther, and Hoppe 2014) (Table 2).

Out of the 1214 primary studies in meta-analyses, 551 studies possess transparent correlation coefficients and publication years. For this sub-sample, we do not find indications to support the learning hypothesis. Although the dispersion of effects, positive and negative alike, increase since the beginning of the 1990s, the aggregated picture stays unchanged. Besides simple observations of the regression line, the time-invariant relation is supported by various trend tests which all fail to detect a time-dependent change of the correlation factors for every year since the mid of the 1990s (Figure 8).

# Discussion

Both vote-count and meta-analytic studies yield comparable results. This is a surprising outcome since the underlying studies are comprised of nearly independent samples (12.9% overlap) and apply different methods. Both methods yield robust results which reinforces the claim that there is a business case for ESG investing. On the one hand, the effect size-transformed vote-count results do not overestimate effect sizes for our sample and lead to comparable results measured as correlation r in comparison to the meta-analytical studies (r = 0.146 vs. mean correlation in meta-analyses between 0.108 and 0.169). Vote-count studies produce, on the other hand, more modest estimates for determining the proportion of positive and negative findings compared to meta-analyses. The share of neutral/mixed results is potentially overestimated for vote-count studies. Vote-count reviews determine whether the effect per study is significant by narrowly focusing on the underlying primary study sample size. Meta-analyses, by contrast, average effects across the entire sample of underlying studies which reduces the meta-analytical mean variance. Smaller variances mean lower thresholds (lower correlations) for significance in meta-analyses.

While overall correlation averages between 0.108 (r = ) and 0.169 (p = ) could be considered rather “small” (Cohen 1988, 1992), they reflect common effect sizes in social sciences (Richard, Bond, and Stokes-Zoota 2003; Tamim et al. 2011; Lipsey et al. 2012) and, notably, might have relatively high relevance for competitive global securities markets. Based on correlation factors and the distribution analysis of more than 2000 empirical studies, we feel confident in generalizing that ESG criteria and CFP are, on average, positively correlated.

The distinct positive empiric result is found across various approaches, regions, and asset classes – except for portfolio-related studies. This outlier is potentially the source of the widespread misperception on the ESG–CFP relation. Institutional and private investors typically conclude that the ESG–CFP relation is, at best, neutral – consistent with the neoclassical understanding of capital markets (Markowitz 1952; Fama 1970; Friedman 1970; Fama 1991). Such an assumption about the ESG–CFP relation can be a key barrier for the broad uptake of sustainable investing among investors and investment advisors (Paetzold and Busch 2014; Reynolds 2014; CFA Institute 2015; Paetzold, Busch, and Chesney 2015).

The realized performance in portfolios depends on the overlapping effects of systematic and idiosyncratic risks (Campbell et al. 2001; Luo and Bhattacharya 2009), on construction constraints (Clarke, de Silva, and Thorley 2002), and on costs for portfolio implementation (Carhart 1997; Khorana, Servaes, and Tufano 2009) which may distort pure ESG performance. Indeed, we find a significant difference in correlation levels of portfolio and nonportfolio studies. We argue that ESG portfolios should be expected to exhibit lower correlations to CFP and less positive findings for the following three reasons: (1) following the “drowned out by noise” argument (Peloza 2009), various overlapping market and nonmarket factors in a portfolio tend to

cover potentially existing ESG alpha. (2) Most ESG funds constitute a mixture of so-called negative and positive ESG-screened funds, which could result in distortion and cancellation of any remaining effects (Derwall, Koedijk, and Ter Horst 2011). (3) Only studies on portfolios (in particular mutual funds) embed management fees and other costs such as performance fees and trading costs. Observed effects in firm-specific study designs are typically calculated without such fees and costs. As roughly 2.5% per annum in various fees are carried by the average mutual fund (Carhart 1997; Barber, Odean, and Zheng 2005; Khorana, Servaes, and Tufano 2009), real correlation patterns in portfolio studies are most likely distorted. We conclude that portfolio-study findings have to be treated as a specific outcome of a subgroup within the entire ESG–CFP discussion. Investors, on average, are unlikely to harvest the existing ESG alpha after implementation costs. However, it can be argued, sophisticated investors are more likely to do so (Grossman and Stiglitz 1980; Hoepner 2013; Nagy, Kassam, and Lee 2015). Thus, our results underpin previous findings: at the worst case, investors in ESG mutual funds can expect to lose nothing compared to conventional fund investments (Hamilton, Jo, and Statman 1993; Humphrey and Tan 2014; Revelli and Viviani 2015).

Regional findings reveal that within developed markets, there is a higher share of positive results from North America compared to Europe and Asia/Australia. This can partially be explained by the lower share of portfolio studies within the sub-sample for North America. Within the individual E, S, and G categories, E and G exhibit a slightly more positive relation than S-focused studies. However, the difference between E and S studies with positive and negative outcomes is marginal (maximum 4.3% percentage points). Meta-analyses focusing on social aspects (van Wijk, Jansen, and Lyles 2008; Crook et al. 2011; Stam, Arzlanian, and Elfring 2014) usually find higher correlations, in contrast to environmental-focused meta-analyses (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat, Guenther, and Hoppe 2014). We conclude that no single E, S, and G category demonstrates a meaningful superior positive relation to CFP.

The strength of our analysis is the aggregation of a large number of studies through secondary research on review studies, but it is also uncovers the inherit limitations of the underlying studies. One of them is the lengthy academic publication period of primary and likewise secondary research. Although our second-level review study includes all relevant review studies published until the end of 2014, it loses some representativeness for primary studies with a publication date of 2012 and younger.

# Conclusion

Through a second-level review of 60 review studies – including both, vote-count studies and meta-analyses – on the ESG–CFP relation, we are able to combine more than 3700 study results from more than 2200 unique primary studies. Based on this sample, we clearly find evidence for the business case for ESG investing. This finding contrasts with the common perception among investors. The contrary perception of investors may be biased due to findings of portfolio studies, which exhibit, on average, a neutral/mixed ESG–CFP performance relation. It is important to be aware that the results of these (to date about 150 studies) are overlaid by various systematic and idiosyncratic risks in portfolios and, in the case of mutual funds, by implementation costs. Still more than 2100 other – in particular company-focused – empiric studies suggest a positive ESG relation.

ESG outperformance opportunities exist in many areas of the market. In particular, we find that this holds true for North America, Emerging Markets, and in nonequity asset classes. Our results propose that capital markets so far demonstrate no consistent learning effects regarding the ESG–CFP relation: Since the mid-1990s, the positive correlation patterns in primary studies have been stable over time (Table 1).

# Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment

Based on this exhaustive review effort, our main conclusion is: the orientation toward long-term responsible investing should be important for all kinds of rational investors in order to fulfill their fiduciary duties and may better align investors’ interests with the broader objectives of society. This requires a detailed and profound understanding of how to integrate ESG criteria into investment processes in order to harvest the full potential of value-enhancing ESG factors. A key area for future research is to better understand the interaction of different ESG criteria in portfolios and the relevance of specific ESG sub-criteria for CFP. These insights will shed further light on the ESG determinants for long-term positive performance impacts.

# Notes

1. The statistical explanatory power in studies is usually low and the primary study might come to the conclusion, based on its calculated significance values and sample sizes, that a certain effect is nonsignificant. Vote-count reviews may also come to biased conclusions by simply concentrating on significant statistics of primary studies to decide if an effect across studies is positive or negative. Potentially they overestimate nonsignificant results. Besides, the explanatory power of vote-count studies shrinks with the increasing number of (contradictory) studies. Meta-studies directly import effect sizes and samples sizes to compute a summary effect across all primary studies. This aggregation method of data could better detect existing correlation patterns in combined samples (Hedges and Olkin 1980; Hunter et al. 1982).
2. The term “second-level review study” describes our aggregation of first-level review studies, regardless if they are vote-count studies or meta-analyses. “Second-order meta-analysis” is the psychometric aggregation technique for first-level meta-analyses as introduced by Schmidt and Oh (2013). This technique is used for the statistical aggregation of the 25 meta-analyses in our sample to compute summary effect sizes.
3. Portfolio studies comprise of studies on long-short ESG portfolios and in particular studies on ESG mutual funds and indices.
4. Two of the typical ways to treat missing data are model-based distribution estimation and the replacement of missing data (imputation) with estimated ones (Schafer and Graham 2002; Tsikriktsis 2005). The latter is applied due to the nonparametric nature of the data. We estimate the total number of missing net studies based on the subgroup means of overlaps in transparent vote-count studies, meta-analyses, and among both. The determined subgroup overlap means are applied to each subgroup of nontransparent studies.
5. The method assumes simplistically comparable sample sizes for the underlying primary studies, which is rather the exception in research synthesis. It is also constructed as fixed effect model, which assumes that studies draw samples from a population with the same standardized mean difference (Hedges and Olkin 1980). The calculated effect size for the vote-count sample should therefore be seen as quick approximate estimate instead of a final analysis (Hedges and Olkin 1985).
6. Please refer to table 1, p. 210 in Schmidt and Oh (2013) for a technical summary of the approach.
7. The applied tests are Pettitt, SNHT, Buishand, and von Neumann. The null hypothesis of the tests verifies if a time series is homogenous between two randomly selected times within the time series. The different tests allow conclusions not only for an assumed normal distribution but also for nonparametric distributions. Only data previous to 1997 are assessed as nonhomogenous to later observations in 2 of 4 tests. The SNHT test detects significantly higher results before 1985. The Buishand test detects significantly higher results previous to 1997 at the .05 level.

# Abstract

Stories about corporate social responsibility have become very frequent over the past decade, and managers can no longer ignore their impact on firm value. In this paper, we investigate the extent and the determinants of the stock market’s reaction following ordinary news related to environmental, social and governance issues—the so-called ESG factors. To that purpose, we use an original database provided by Covalence EthicalQuote. Our empirical analysis is based on about 33,000 ESG news (positive or negative), targeting one hundred listed companies over the period 2002–2010. On average, firms facing negative events experience a drop in their market value of 0.1%, whereas companies gain nothing on average from positive announcements. We find also that market participants are responsive to the media, but they do not react to firms’ press releases or to NGOs’ disclosures. Moreover, our results indicate that sector’s reputation mitigates the loss (the goodwill hypothesis) and that cultural proximity and lexical contents of ESG disclosures play a significant role in the magnitude of the impact.

# Introduction

“Even the largest avalanche is triggered by small things.” Vernor Vinge1

Companies are used to coping, almost everyday, with one or several news concerning their social responsibility. Certainly, the debate on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and what should be the firm’s objective(s) is not settled. There are still lively controversies on this question (Portney 2008; Porter and Kramer 2011), but whatever the answer, evidence suggests that environmental, social or corporate governance concerns—the so-called ESG factors—may impact firm value and managers can no longer ignore this.

Recent history provides many instances where bad corporate social responsibility caused huge economic and financial losses. Consider, for instance, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April 2010: 3 months after the disaster, BP had lost half its share value, which represents tens of billions dollars (Smith et al. 2011). Some even reported that, given the size of the company, the oil spill impacted the UK economy as a whole. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011 is a dramatic example too. Admittedly, the accident is the direct consequence of the Great East Japan Earthquake, but the extent of the accident is also related to governance failures by TEPCO, whose market value has collapsed (Kawashima and Takeda 2012;

1 The Coming Technological Singularity, 1993.

G. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit

Lopatta and Kaspereit 2014). Another recent example, albeit much less dramatic, is the Moncler scandal: in November 2014, after a television report showed geese being mistreated while being plucked by jacket makers, the market value of the Italian luxury outerwear company decreased by 6%.

However, beyond anecdotal evidence, we know little about the impact of ESG news on firm value, on a day-to-day basis. Recently, two papers provide interesting insights.2 First, Krueger (2015) studies how stock markets react to positive and negative ESG events and provide evidence that investors respond strongly negatively to negative events and weakly negatively to positive events. Second, Aouadi and Marsat (2016) have investigated the relationship between ESG controversies and firm market value using a dataset of more than 3000 ESG controversies provided by Asset4 Thomson Reuters. They show that higher CSP score has an impact on market value (Tobin’s Q) only for high-attention firms, located in countries with greater press freedom, more searched on the Internet, more followed by analysts, and with an improved corporate social reputation. Thus, these findings provide new insights on the role of firm visibility through which firms can profit from their CSP. These results are appealing and, in this paper, we attempt to contribute to this burgeoning literature.

In this study, we investigate the stock market’s reaction to about 33,000 ESG news from 2002 to 2010 targeting one hundred multinational companies listed among the largest in the world. To that purpose, we use an original dataset provided by Covalence EthicalQuote, a Geneva-based firm specialized in ethical quotation.3 The large number of news allows us to perform a robust-event study. The Covalence classification is used to build a range of variables of interest, such as the type, the source or the region of occurrence of an event. First, we globally examine the direct impact of positive and negative ESG news on firms’ stock market capitalization and the consequences on shareholders’ wealth. Second, we seek to determine whether certain characteristics of the news or of the targeted firm affect this impact. Thanks to the wide spectrum of events, we are able to implement multidimensional regressions to determine the main drivers of abnormal returns and which features have a key impact.

The academic literature on the impact of ESG news is larger, but most of the papers assess the market reaction following a specific event, based on small hand-collected samples without much details. Consequently, they provide little evidence concerning the determinants of the reaction or comparison between different events.

Recently, Elayan et al. (2014) have also used data from Covalence EthicalQuote, but they only consider aggregated information. However, their results suggest that these pieces of information convey useful information to shareholders.

The richness of the database allows us to test a broad set of hypotheses. We first set apart positive and negative ESG news and examine a possible asymmetric impact. We also consider whether shareholders’ perception is different whether the news is related to environmental, social or corporate governance issues. Further, we pay attention to the source of the news. Is the impact the same whether the news is published by the media, the firms themselves or NGOs? And do shareholders react differently when the news is published in a financial newspaper or a media devoted to CSR? We also investigate whether the impact of CSR on stock prices has evolved over time, and whether geographic and cultural proximity between events and shareholders matters. We also carry out a content (textual) analysis to characterize more precisely each news. Finally, we test whether the reputation may serve as a “reservoir of goodwill” in times of crisis.

Our results show that firms coping with ESG negative events experience a low but significant drop in their market value. On average, in our sample, the decrease is of 0.1% on a window of 3 days around the announcement. On the contrary, companies coping with positive events do not experience any significant change in their market value. In addition, it seems that stock market penalties do not vary significantly over time, which challenges the conventional idea of a raising awareness on ESG issues. Our results also indicate that sector’s ESG reputation mitigates the loss and that market participants only react to information disclosed by the media and not to firm press releases; in other words, investors do not seem to be fooled by the efforts of companies to appear at their best. Finally, the loss is larger when there is a cultural proximity between shareholders and the event and when the content of a news has a quantitative, an economic or a legal orientation.

This research might have a number of important implications for both shareholders, companies and activists concerning CSR disclosures. Indeed, this paper provides guidance to understand when ESG news are likely to influence firm’s value. This paper also contributes to the literature on greenwashing effectiveness and NGOs influence. Furthermore, our contribution is not limited to CSR issues as our work may be related to the growing body of economic research on how shareholders process information.

The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. “Related Empirical Papers” section surveys the related literature about the impact of ESG news on stock prices. “Hypotheses Development” section provides some theoretical background and posits a set of testable hypotheses. “A Two-Step Hypotheses Testing Procedure” section describes the data and the variables, while the event study methodology is briefly presented in “Data on ESG News” section. The econometric analysis is implemented in “The

Impact of ESG News on Stock Prices’’ section, and the results are discussed. ‘‘Conclusion’’ section concludes.

# Related Empirical Papers

Several academic papers have aimed at assessing the reaction of shareholders to various types of extra-financial events, in particular events harmful to the environment.4 Most of them focused on public environmental disclosure programs (mainly the US Toxic Release Inventory; e.g., Hamilton 1995), judicial actions following environmental violations (e.g., Karpoff et al. 2005), or industrial accidents causing ecological damages (e.g., Capelle-Blancard and Laguna 2010). Some academic papers also consider the impact of ‘‘bad’’ social or corporate governance practices on firms’ market value. This includes a very diverse set of events: product recalls (e.g., Jarrell and Peltzman 1985), airline crashes (e.g., Borenstein and Zimmerman 1988), product tampering (Mitchell 1989), corporate fraud (e.g., Karpoff and Lott 1993; Chaney and Philipich 2002), ‘‘unethical behavior’’ (Gunthorpe 1997), social movements and protests (King and Soule 2007) or massive layoffs (e.g., Farber and Hallock 2009). These studies provided salient results and showed, overall, that the market penalty may go beyond the direct cost for the company, although apparently without providing sufficient incentives for corporate executives to behave differently.

A common limit of these previous papers, however, is that they focus on extreme events. Oil spills, industrial accidents, toxic releases, product tampering, corporate frauds, etc., have a significant negative impact: this is a well-established fact. But what about less dramatic events? How do shareholders react to ‘‘ordinary’’ news? This question is important for at least three reasons. First of all, CSR does not consist merely in avoiding ecological or social disasters. Instead, according to its proponents, CSR should be embedded in all corporate operations, at every stage; CSR is a matter of day-to-day practices. Accordingly, everyday events should be addressed to assess corporate social performance. Second, all previous studies focus on few industries (particularly the petrochemical firms) which are prone to extreme events, while all firms should be involved. Specifically, the stock market impact of CSR in services or for high-tech companies is largely ignored, whereas these industries represent a large and growing part of the economic activity. Lastly, the tremendous development of social networks and the speed by which they spread information makes any ordinary event a potential market mover. In the case of Moncler (mentioned supra), it seems that the fall in stock prices has been triggered by algorithmic trading following an avalanche of negative tweets against the company.

The impact of ESG news on firm value on a day-to-day basis has received little scrutiny so far. A first attempt was made by Klassen and McLaughlin (1996). In their seminal study, they consider companies listed on the Nyse or the Amex over the period 1985–1991 and examine 22 environmental negative events (oil spill, gas leak, explosion and other incidental pollution) and 140 positive ones (environmental awards) extracted from the Nexis database. On average, negative events yield significant abnormal returns of -1.5% ($0.70 per share), whereas positive events lead to significant abnormal returns of 0.82% ($0.37 per share).

Thereafter, some papers have examined the market reaction to CSR awards and certifications (Jacobs et al. 2010; Lyon et al. 2013), CSR rankings (Takeda and Tomozawa 2008), CSR stock index redefinitional (Capelle-Blancard and Couderc 2009; Oberndorfer et al. 2013), voluntary corporate initiatives (Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn 2011; Yu 2012) or the release of standalone CSR reports (Yu et al. 2013). These papers, however, consider positive news only and secondhand information; they are limited by the small size of their sample, and they are not really suitable to determine what are the key factors influencing shareholders.

More recently, Flammer (2013) has extended the approach initiated by Klassen-McLaughlin with a sample of 117 eco-friendly events and 156 eco-harmful events extracted from the Wall Street Journal over the period 1980–2009. Unsurprisingly, she finds that announcements of eco-harmful corporate behavior lead to negative abnormal returns (-0.65%) and that eco-friendly corporate initiatives generate positive abnormal returns (0.84%). She also provides additional interesting insights. Her results suggest that companies have been increasingly penalized for irresponsible behavior toward the environment over time and that shareholders of firms with stronger environmental performance react less negatively to the announcement of eco-harmful behavior. Yet, this paper focuses on a single dimension of CSR, considers only major events and is still limited by the small size of the sample.

Finally, the only paper that examines the relationship between CSR and stock price with firsthand events on all CSR dimensions and with a relatively large database is Krueger (2015). This paper, which has been carried out in

G. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit

parallel, is the one whose approach comes close to ours. In his paper, he considers 2116 negative and positive ESG events concerning 745 different firms between 2001 and 2007. The data are extracted from the KLD database. The results confirm that negative news are followed by a stock price decrease, while the impact of good events is positive only in cases of poor stakeholder relations. One of its main contributions is the content analysis which shows that investors react more strongly to ESG news containing strong economic and legal information content.

All these results are appealing. However, the main drawback of most of these studies is the relative small size of the samples used. Indeed, they usually relied on hand collection and coding of news content, which automatically restricted the sample size. Consequently, most of the papers simply assess the market reaction following a specific event and cannot provide much detail. Very few papers provide evidence concerning the determinants of the reaction or provide any comparison between heterogeneous events.

# Hypotheses Development

It is virtually impossible to open the business section of the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, The Economist, or any business publication today without seeing mention of measures being taken by some company to become more ‘‘socially responsible’’. – Paul R. Portney (2008)

In the media, stories about CSR have become very frequent over the past decade. This statement is confirmed by Fig. 1 which reports the number of occurrences for the wording ‘‘corporate social responsibility’’ in the newspapers. The query is based on online archive collections provided by Dow Jones Factiva (it covers all major newspapers and publications in the world; that is, more than 10,000 news sources including major publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, etc.). Both in absolute terms (the raw number of occurrences) and in relative terms (as a percentage of the number of articles which mentioned the word ‘‘finance’’), the occurrence of the CSR concept is growing quickly, and now it is quite common.

ESG news are increasingly popular and newsworthy. Information on CSR is likely to make good stories, and it is reasonable to consider that soft news on ESG issues and the emotive language associated are more appealing for a large audience than hard information on company’s financial statements for instance.

Extensive media coverage might also be explained by the fact that ESG news are ‘‘blue-compatible’’. Empirical evidence suggests that Democrats (the ‘‘blues’’), in contrast to Republicans (‘‘the reds’’), are more apt to support causes such as environmental and labor protection, and they are more supportive of the stakeholder theory. For instance, Hong and Kostovetsky (2012) find that mutual fund managers who make campaign donations to Democrats hold less of their portfolios in industries that are deemed socially irresponsible (based on KLD ratings). Moreover, news media seems to be biased toward liberal ideas; see Groseclose and Milyo (2005) for empirical evidence from the USA. All together, this is consistent with the heavy weight news media give to ESG issues.

Does it pay to be good? There is an extensive academic literature on the relationship between CSR and firms value, using a wide variety of empirical methodologies (event studies, impact on Tobin’s Q or firm profitability, portfolio analysis, etc.). While these studies provide mixed results, most of the surveys (including several meta-analyses) suggest a positive correlation between CSR and measures of firm performance, such as profit (Margolis and Walsh 2003; Orlitzky et al. 2003; Scholtens 2008; Margolis et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2016).

From a theoretical perspective, however, as pointed by MacWilliams and Siegel (2000), marginal costs and benefits of CSR should offset each other in equilibrium, and consequently, the relationship between CSR and financial performance should be neutral. Moreover, the fact that ESG news are more and more frequent does not mean that they have a significant impact on firms’ market value. Being a media hype is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for being a market mover. ESG news are often considered as soft news. This is a clear advantage to attract media attention and readers, but at the same time, it is somehow a drawback from the investors’ point of view, because soft news are more difficult to process (Demers and Vega 2010). Thus, for instance, Orlitzky (2013) challenges the conventional wisdom about the net benefits of CSR and argues that ESG news may harm stock markets: ‘‘market signals about CSR [are] full of, and in fact generating new, noise because of (a) the ambivalent impact of CSR on an organization’s economic performance and (b) information asymmetry in financial markets, resulting in large part from managerial opportunism (p. 240).’’

Thus, the common view is that ESG news impact firm value, although some doubts have not been allayed. That is, we first test a general but fundamental hypothesis:

# H 1 ESG news have a significant impact on firms’ market value.

The carrot or the stick? Our second hypothesis is related to the (a)symmetry of the impact of ESG news. Previous research in behavioral economics has shown that responses to positive and negative economic information are asymmetric (Schepers 2006).

Historically, investor awareness on ESG issues emerged with the rejection of ‘‘sin stocks.’’ Practices have evolved,

and nowadays socially responsible investors use generally both negative and positive screens. Still, the punishment seems intuitively more powerful and prevalent than the reward (Bird et al. 2007). According to previous studies, it is reasonable to assume that negative news have more impact in magnitude than positive ones. For instance, Klassen and McLaughlin (1996) find that positive stock returns after positive news are smaller, in absolute value, than negative stock returns after negative news. Similarly, Krueger (2015) finds that negative ESG events are followed by a stock price decrease, while the impact of positive ESG events is somewhat ambivalent and depends on the quality of the relations between the firms and their stakeholders. Note, however, that Flammer (2013) finds a significant effect, both for eco-friendly and eco-harmful corporate behaviors.

So, does it pay less to be good than it costs to be bad? As stated by Mattingly and Berman (2006), positive and negative social actions are both empirically and conceptually distinct (see also Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017). In particular, ESG-positive events are more diverse in nature, while ESG-negative events are likely to be more compelling.

# H2

The impact of ESG news on firms’ market value is larger for bad news, compared to good news.

Public relations and watchdog NGOs It is expected that shareholders pay more attention to what they see as the most neutral source of information. As such, we expect that the media would be more influential, both because of their objectivity and their wide readership, relative to less independent sources of ESG news. Accordingly, we hypothesize that news published by the companies themselves (firms’ press releases) or by NGOs have a lower impact on stock price, than news published by the media.

Indeed, to cope with increasing ESG concerns, companies have adapted their communication strategy. In particular, they disclose more and more information concerning their social responsibility. Obviously, it raises the question of the relevance of such news disclosures in a context of informational asymmetries. On the one hand, companies have a clear informational advantage but, on the other hand, the credibility of firms’ announcements is low given that they have an interest to distort information to their own benefit.

While there is a growing theoretical literature on greenwashing and ESG disclosures (Baron 2005; Lyon and Maxwell 2011), empirical evidence on the effectiveness and the impact of such strategies is missing. A similar issue arises with NGOs. NGOs engage in private politics (Baron 2001), trying to influence firms’ ESG practices. They have two main choices. They can either work directly with firms and highlight ESG improvements or report bad ESG practices (Lyon 2010), to influence medias and consumers. With the recent rise of public awareness on ESG issues, several NGOs choose to focus on public information campaigns rather than lobby the government (Yu 2005).

Are advocacy NGOs able to impact stock prices? Is collaboration (by disclosing positive ESG news) more efficient than denunciation (bad news)? Several papers have cast doubt on NGOs influence, and there are growing debates on collaboration between.

Interestingly, Zyglidopoulos et al. (2012) find that more media attention leads to an increase in CSR strengths, but does not drive any significant change in CSR weaknesses. Yet, this is still consistent with our hypothesis suggesting that it is more expensive for firms to improve their weaknesses, than to enhance their strengths.

NGOs and corporations (Yaziji and Doh 2009), which could lower NGOs credibility (Gibelman and Gelman 2004). To our knowledge, there is no impact assessments other than case studies (Spar and Mure 2003; Doh and Guay 2006). We attempt to provide insights on these issues by testing whether the impact of ESG news varies according to the source.

# Media visibility and specialization

In practice, shareholders do not give equal importance to all sources. In particular, it is expected that disclosures of the leading financial newspapers have a larger impact. For instance, Huberman and Regev (2001) have shown that the market might react sharply to a news published in The New York Times, even if the information has been already reported in various popular journals or newspapers (Nature, Times, etc.). Conversely, it is likely that shareholders who value ESG issues scrutinize specialized media dedicated to CSR. All together, this leads to two non-exclusive hypotheses.

The impact of ESG news on firms’ market value is larger when it comes from leading financial newspapers.

# Main Environmental, Social or Governance issues

It seems, a priori, quite natural to separate environmental, social and corporate governance issues when testing whether one particular dimension of CSR has more importance for shareholders. However, there is no theoretical underpinnings and it appears to be mostly an empirical issue. In this respect, the literature on Socially Responsible Investing might provide some information: there is preliminary evidence of superior returns for portfolios based on employee relations (Edmans 2012) and corporate governance (Barnett and Salomon 2006; Renneboog et al. 2011), but we should be cautious in generalizing these findings. It seems more appropriate to consider the effect at a sectoral level. The impact of ESG news might be larger when the event is associated with a main concern for the firm.

As stated by Caroll (1979), the issues that business must address largely differ depending on the industry. Different industries face different problems and external pressure might vary accordingly (Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017). For instance, environmental issues are undoubtedly more important for the Oil and gas sector than for the banking sector.

# H 7

The impact of ESG news on firms’ market value is lower in times of economic crisis.

Reputation The theoretical literature on the effect of reputation on financial performance is somewhat inconclusive. On the one hand, Jones et al. (2000) and Werther and Chandler (2005) argue that CSR may serve as a “reservoir of goodwill” in times of crisis. Accordingly, we can expect that firms with good reputation experience a lower decrease of their market value after the disclosure of negative ESG news. On the other hand, Baron and Diermeier (2007) and Baron (2009) state that companies with highly visible CSR activities face increased public scrutiny.

and may experience a ‘‘boomerang effect’’ in case of dis- disappointment. This is empirically conﬁrmed by Luo et al. (2012): while BP was regarded as the ‘‘greenest’’ company in the oil industry, and Exxon as the ‘‘brownest,’’ BP accidents were more likely to be reported than Exxon accidents. Kim et al. (2014) ﬁnd that CSR performance is negatively associated with future stock crash risk, which also supports the mitigating effect of CSR. Theoretically, the two approaches are equally relevant and nothing came to our attention that suggests that the goodwill effect should be stronger or weaker than the boomerang effect.

Further, it should be paid attention to the way the reputation is deﬁned. Rennings et al. (2007) point out that results may signiﬁcantly differ depending on whether the ﬁrm’s reputation is computed in respect with their industry peers or not. Empirically, they found that only the ﬁrm’s absolute reputa- tion has a signiﬁcant impact on shareholder wealth. Accordingly, we consider two versions of the goodwill hypothesis.

The impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is lower for ﬁrms in sectors with good ESG reputations.

# H 8b

The impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is lower for ﬁrms with good ESG reputations in comparison with their peers.

Greenwashing If reputation serves effectively as a reser- voir of goodwill, it might be very tempting for a ﬁrm to appear at its best and to mislead shareholders. Such strategies are usually referred to as greenwashing, that is, the selective disclosure of positive and negative information by the ﬁrm on ESG issues. Like reputation, the impact of greenwashing is theoretically ambivalent. As stated by Lyon and Maxwell (2011), ‘‘although companies naturally want to publicize their environmentally friendly actions, they are often sur- prisingly hesitant to promote their environmental successes or to issue detailed environmental reports. Part of the reason appears to be that activists react more angrily to ﬁrms that lay claim to being virtuous, and then are discovered to have feet of clay, than to ﬁrms that never make such claims.’’ Empirically however, since there is extensive evidence of greenwashing, it suggests that ﬁrms have a net interest in this (unless one considers that they do not know where their advantage lies).

# H 9

The impact of negative ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is lower for ﬁrms which are prone to greenwashing.

‘‘Watch your words, for they become actions.’’ Recently, several studies have shown the importance of news media content in explaining stock price variations. These works, initiated by Tetlock (2007), aim to study the impact of qualitative verbal information on shareholders. For doing so, they used content analysis (also referred to as textual analysis), which can be deﬁned as a set of methods that seek to describe in a systematic and quantitative manner the content of a text. Although the method has been used frequently in social sciences, it has become prevalent among economists only recently. We propose to build on this approach to capture some speciﬁc features of the ESG news (Krueger (2015) has followed a similar approach).

We focus here on four criteria based on the Harvard IV-4 and Lasswell Value dictionaries: economic, legal, qualita- tive and quantitative. Qualitative information is naturally more difﬁcult to process than quantitative one, and there is evidence that information with high processing costs dif- fuses slowly into asset prices. Moreover, it is likely that ESG events with a legal or economic ori- entation will have a larger impact on stock prices.

The impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is larger when the articles contain words referencing to eco- nomic or legal orientations.

Out of sight, out of mind? Tavares (2003) shows that the amount of foreign aid is decreasing with the geographical and cultural distance between giving and receiving coun- tries. Engelberg and Parsons (2011), who examine earning announcements in the USA show also that the impact of media on ﬁnancial markets is inﬂuenced by the distance. Accordingly, we investigate whether the proximity between a company and where the event takes place inﬂuences the impact of ESG news on shareholders behavior and ﬁrms’ market value.

# H 11

The impact of ESG news on ﬁrms’ market value is larger for local events or for more proximate geographi- cally or culturally events.

The next sections will present the procedure used to test these assumptions, and how we proxy the main character- istics of the targeted corporations and the features of the news that may shape investors’ sentiment and inﬂuence the impact on stock price.

# A Two-Step Hypotheses Testing Procedure

To test our set of hypotheses, we investigate the extent to which ESG news affect ﬁrm’s stock price. We proceed in two steps (as King and Soule 2007; Capelle-Blancard and Laguna 2010; Flammer 2013; Krueger 2015). First, we

# G. Capelle-Blancard, A. Petit

assess the direct impact of ESG news on stock prices using the event study methodology. Then, we aim to determine whether certain characteristics of the news or the firm might explain stock price variations.

# The Event Study Methodology

Event studies examine the behavior of stock prices around corporate events. This methodology is widely used to measure shareholders’ reaction to all kinds of unexpected news (Kothari and Warner 2006). The underpinning of event studies is the efficient market hypothesis (Fama et al. 1969), which states that as new information becomes available, it is fully taken into account by shareholders. Accordingly, stock price changes reflect, to some extent, the discounted value of current and future firm’s cash flows. In practice, the basic idea is that shareholders’ reaction to a specific information can be measured by comparing the observed return to the return that we would expect in absence of any firm-specific event; this difference is called the “abnormal return.” If investors react (un)favorably to an event, we would expect (negative) positive significant abnormal returns. The strength of this approach is that it is based on the overall assessment of many investors who quickly process all available information in assessing firm’s market value. Moreover, this approach reduces reverse causality concerns which might appear when one examines the correlation between CSR and accounting measures of firm performance, such as profits.

Formally, we follow the approach defined by MacKinlay (1997) and consider the Market model (augmented with a sectoral index) to predict returns. Hence, for each event, abnormal returns are computed as follows:

ARij;s;t = Rj;s;t - E(Rj;s;t) = Rj;s;t - bj - bjabRm;t - bRs;tcj

where ARij;s;t measure the shareholders’ reaction to the event i targeting the firm j, which belong to the industry s, at time t. Rj;s;t is the observed return for the firm j, Rm;t is the corresponding market return and Rs;t the corresponding sectoral return. The parameters aj, bj and cj are estimated over a 60-day window ([-70, -11]).

As usual, abnormal returns are aggregated over (2n + 1)-day periods around the event: n days before to catch possible insiders information, the day of the event and n days after. It leads, for each event, to cumulative abnormal returns (for n = 1; ...; 5):

CARij;s;t[n; +n] = Σs=t-n ARij;s;s

To test hypotheses 1, 2 and 3, we separate ESG news between good news and bad news and according to the source (media, firms and NGOs). Then, for each category, we compute average abnormal returns (AAR = ARi) and cumulative average abnormal returns (CAAR[n; +n] = CARi[n; +n]) and use statistical analysis to test the significance of our results (see MacKinlay, 1997). Stock market data are from Datastream.

# Regression Specification

In addition to assessing the direct effect of ESG news on stock price, we aim to determine whether certain characteristics of the event or the firm affect abnormal returns. To this end, we use a regression-based approach. Specifically, we estimate the following model:

CARij;s;t[n; +n] = a + b Trendt + C0Xi + K0Yj;t + dj + hs + ei;j;s;t

where CARij;s;t[n; +n] is the cumulative abnormal return for the event i, occurring at the date t, targeting the firm j, which belongs to the industry s, over a centered (2n + 1)-day window (Eq. 2). Trendt is a linear monthly trend. Xi is a vector of variables related to the event and Yj;t is a vector of variables related to the targeted firm at time t. dj and hs are firm and industry fixed effects, respectively. ei;j;s;t is the error term. We use White heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. The coefficients of interest are b, C and K which capture the characteristics related to hypotheses 4 through 11. Definition and sources of the variables are presented in the next section.

Alternative specifications (with or without the sectoral index or with the CAPM) lead to very similar results. The most serious concern is about confounding events. While there is an extensive literature on the event study methodology, the contamination of the estimation period (Aktas et al. 2007) or the event period (Nelson et al. 2008) has attracted little attention. The standard approach consists in using a case-by-case analysis to neutralize all the confounding events, but this approach is impractical for large samples. In our case, we know precisely the dates of the possible confounding events (not all of them, but the ones related to ESG news). Then, we provide a robustness check in order to tackle the problem of confounding events. We consider another estimation window (-130, -11) where confounding events included in the Covalence EthicalQuote database are neutralized. In other words, for each firm, the days surrounding ESG news (-1, 0, +1) are dropped from the estimation window. The results are qualitatively the same (see in “Appendix” section). But the contamination by non-ESG events of the estimation period or the event period remains a possible limitation of this study.

# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction

Data on ESG News are valuable. However, unlike Elayan et al. (2014), we do not consider aggregated data, but we examine the impact of every piece of ESG news.

The potential number of ESG news to examine is huge: dozens are published almost every day for each firm, either by the media, NGOs, consultants or the firms themselves. Therefore, in order to assess the financial impact of these information we need a very large database. Furthermore, each piece of news should be sufficiently comprehensive and precise to analyze what drives the market reaction.

Most of the time, to conduct an event study, academics compose their database by collecting events from newspapers archives. In recent years, online search engines have facilitated this collect. Still, there is a huge amount of work to process the events, which usually limits the size of the database. Thus, until now, most event studies consider, at best, hundreds of events.

In this study, we use an original database provided by Covalence EthicalQuote. Created in 2001 in Geneva (Switzerland), Covalence EthicalQuote has developed a systematic collect of positive and negative ESG information concerning the world’s largest companies. The range of ESG news is very broad. Positive news includes, for instance, announcement of a social sponsoring program, the launch of new eco-innovative product, a green award, etc. Negative news goes from toxic release disclosure to rumors of downsizing, through the disclosure of bad labor practices in subcontractor factories, etc.

According to Covalence EthicalQuote, each day 20 analysts perform a total of 80 h of reading, screening 2000 news items (in English, Spanish, German and French). As of 2010, their database includes more than 190,000 information items from more than 10,000 sources, covering a universe of more than 500 companies. Covalence EthicalQuote uses its database to feed its ethical reputation scoring system. For each firm, the score is computed by aggregating positive and negative ethical news. Then, the scores, the rankings and some specific reports are sold to various agents like banks (Barclays, BNP Paribas, HSBC, etc), companies (Coca-Cola, HP, Nokia, etc.) and NGOs (Gain, MSF, WWF, etc.). The main advantage of this database is its comprehensiveness. Moreover, contrary to sustainability ratings, the information is firsthand.

Recently, Elayan et al. (2014) have shown that the Covalence EthicalQuote data convey some useful information to investors. Indeed, they find a causal relationship between stock market reaction and Covalence quarterly press releases, which indicate changes in the ethical score of the firms. Their results reinforce our idea that these data.

9 See ‘‘Appendix’’ section for some examples of ESG news collected by Covalence EthicalQuote.

# The Sample

Covalence provides us a sample of 126,365 ESG news items from January 2002 to December 2010. These news involve 100 listed firms which belong to the Dow Jones Sector Titans indexes (the complete list is provided in ‘‘Appendix’’ section). Some news items are related to the same event, occurred on nonbusiness days, or are poorly specified (either the nature, the event or the source of the news is missing). Consequently, these news are dropped: this leaves 65,881 events (52% of the sample). Moreover, several news may occur for the same firm on the same day, making impossible any interpretation of the market reaction. These news are dropped also, leaving a total of 33,067 ESG news (26% of the initial sample), positive or negative. This represents, on average, three ESG news per firm every month. The total number of news per firms varies approximately from 150 to 600, with a standard deviation of 110. The complete distribution is presented in ‘‘Appendix’’ section.

For each news, we know the name of the firm, the announcement date and the source. Covalence classifies ESG news into a large number of different sources that we aggregate into three categories. We consider that ESG news may come from: (i) media (including internet) and official authorities (governmental bodies, academics, international organizations), (ii) NGOs and trade unions or (iii) the firms themselves. Moreover, Covalence classifies the news into 45 criteria depending on the topic considered (see the detail in ‘‘Appendix’’ section). We group them into three broad criteria: (i) environment, (ii) social and (iii) governance.

|Source|Positive News|Negative News|
|---|---|---|
|Media|84%|84%|
|Firms| | |
|NGOs| | |

This first table gives us some interesting insights. First, the main provider of ESG news is the media which disclose about 84% of the news, firms and NGOs equally sharing the rest. Moreover, the proportion of news by source is approximately the same whether one considers environmental, social or corporate governance issues. Second, our sample of news is well balanced in terms of ESG criteria even if there are slightly more news related to social issues (39% overall), than news on corporate governance (34%) and the environment (29%). Third, the part of ‘‘good’’ news relative to ‘‘bad’’ ones is very skewed.

| |Total|22,391|10,676|2682|166|18,751|8869|1070|1677|

This table documents the number of negative and positive ESG news included in the sample, categorized by source (the firms, the media, the NGOs) and topic (environment, social and governance). One hundred firms are considered (see the list in ‘‘Appendix’’ section) over the period 2002–2010. Data are from Covalence EthicalQuote. Given that some events have been reported by several sources and/or are related to several ESG issues, the total number of news is lower than the sum of the categories.

The number of positive news is two times larger than the total number of negative news. More precisely, the ratio of positive to negative news is 3.1 for environmental news, 1.8 for social issues and 1.5 for corporate governance. Unsurprisingly, firms are the most prone to announce good news: positive news announced by the firms themselves are 16-fold larger than negative news. ESG news from media are also biased toward positive news with a ratio slightly below two. On the contrary, NGOs disclose almost 50% more negative than positive ESG news.

# Definition of the Variables

As we argued above, certain factors are likely to be associated with the effectiveness of ESG news. These factors could be classified into three categories. The impact of ESG news will depend on the nature of the news (the type, the origin, the tone, etc.), the strength of external pressures (the long-term trends, the economic environment, etc.) and the characteristics of the targeted firm (its reputation, its sector, its financial health, etc.). We describe below how we computed the variables which serve as proxies. Descriptive statistics are provided in ‘‘Appendix’’ section.

# ESG Issues

We created three dummy variables E, S and G that are set to one if the news is related to environmental, social or corporate governance issues, respectively. Note that these dummy variables are not exclusive since some information involve several issues.

# Sources

We created a set of dummy variables to distinguish news from the media, from the firms themselves and from NGOs (hypothesis #3). Further, we consider three dummy variables. The first one ‘‘Main newspapers’’ is equal to one when the news was published in one of the ‘‘Top 200 Newspapers in the world.’’ The second one, ‘‘Financial newspapers’’ is set to one when the news was published in a newspaper with a business or financial orientation (Financial Times, Business Week, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg.com, etc.). The last one ‘‘CSR newspapers’’ is equal to one when the news was published by a media specialized in CSR (Ethical Corporation Magazine, CSRwire, GreenBiz.com, etc.) (hypotheses #4a & #4b).

# Sector’s Main Concern

The relevance of ESG news is likely to be different depending on the activity of the firm: Environmental news, for instance, have certainly a different meaning for a petrochemical firm and a bank (hypothesis #5). To capture this, we created a dummy variable equal to one when the news is related to the ‘‘main concern’’ of the firm targeted. The main concern is defined at the industry level, based on the relative percentage of E, S and G news. Firms are classified into six industries: Banks, Basic Resources, Chemicals (including health care), Consumer goods and services, Industrial goods, and Technology. Unsurprisingly, environment is the main concern for ‘‘Basic Resources’’ and ‘‘Chemicals,’’ social issues are the most important for ‘‘Consumer goods and services’’ and ‘‘Industrial goods,’’ and corporate governance is the main stake for ‘‘Banks’’ and ‘‘Technology.’’

# Trends

Our regressions include a linear monthly trend from January 2002 to December 2010 (hypothesis #6).

These lists have been manually checked. The complete list (with more than 1000 sources) is available on request.

For example, the percentage of bad ESG news published by the media on environmental issues is equal to 7% for the banking industry and to 35% for the chemical industry. Conversely, the percentage of bad ESG news published by the media on corporate governance issues is equal to 24% for the banking industry and to 11% for the chemical industry (see Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017).

# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction

use Google Insights for Search between 2004 and 2010 to capture public attention (Da et al. 2011). Google Insights for Search provides insights into the search terms people have been entering into the Google search engine. In this study, we use the keyword ‘‘economic crisis’’ (hypothesis #7) and extract a weekly index. The value of the index is lower than 10 until September–October 2008, when it jumps to 100 in few weeks with the failure of Lehman Brothers. Since then, the index declines regularly toward 20 at the end of 2012.

# Reputation

We proxy CSR reputation, for each firm or sector, by the number of positive ESG news over the total number of ESG news (positive and negative) published by the media (hypotheses #8a & #8b). We calculate this ratio on the year preceding each event to have a rolling measure compatible with companies’ fixed effects. As we want to test simultaneously sectoral and idiosyncratic reputation’s impact on abnormal returns, the firm reputation is defined in comparison to its peers. The latter is a measure of the relative good reputation of a firm compared to the average reputation of a sector. That is, sector reputation is defined between 0 and 1, while firm reputation is defined between -1 and 1.

# Distance

We implement a first indicator of the distance between the country where the event takes place and the firm’s country of origin by considering the logarithm of the distance between the two countries. We implement also a dummy variable equal to 1 if the country where the event takes place and the firm’s country of origin have a common official language (hypothesis #11). Data on geographical and cultural distance are from the CEPII.

# Size

We control for the size of the firms using total assets (in logarithm). A priori, two opposite effects could play a role concerning the influence of the size on the impact of ESG news. On the one hand, investors may be more sensitive to ESG news concerning large firms (Aouadi and Marsat 2016), but on the other hand, the shares of small firms are less liquid, and their reallocation possibilities are weaker. We use also the Price Earning Ratio as a control variable.

# Greenwashing

To assess greenwashing (hypothesis #9), we compute the percentage of positive ESG news disclosed by a firm (or a sector) over the total number of positive ESG news related to this firm (or sector). As for the reputation, we designed a time frame of 1 year preceding each event to have a rolling measure. The greenwashing variable is between 0 and 1 at the sectoral level and between -1 and 1 at the firm level.

# The Impact of ESG News on Stock Prices

# Event Analysis of CAR

We investigate whether the tone of the articles matters (hypotheses #10a & #10b). To quantify this, we rely on four tag categories of the Inquirer dictionary (including the).

12 An alternative would be to use the Volatility Index (VIX) computed by the CBOE and based on the implied volatility of the S&P 500 index options. Often referred to as the fear index, it shows a very similar pattern.

13 We also used the Fortune Magazine’s annual ranking of the ‘‘world’s most admired companies.’’ A problem, however, is that it does not cover all the firms included in our sample. Moreover, according to McGuire et al. (1988), Fortune Magazine’s ranking is linked to prior financial performance.

14 We also used a 6-month and a 2-year time frame for robustness tests, but it does not change the results.

To test the hypotheses #1 and #2, we assess the statistical significance of average abnormal returns by setting apart negative and positive ESG news. Then, to test hypothesis #3 we repeat the analysis separately for ESG news published by firms, media and NGOs. Table 2 presents average abnormal returns (AAR0) and cumulative average abnormal returns (CAAR½ 1;þ1 and CAAR½ 5;þ5), with the corresponding standard deviation in parentheses, for each.

15 We only consider news in English.

16 R&D spendings (divided the total assets) and percentage of floating shares have been used also, but the availability of the data (moreover, only annual) lowers the size of the sample without changing meaningfully the results.

This table presents the average change in firm’s market value around the publication of ESG news, from least squares regressions (using White-corrected standard errors). Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. AAR½t¼0 is the average abnormal return the day of the publication, CAAR½ 1;þ1 and CAAR½ 5;þ5 are the cumulative average abnormal returns over 3 and 10 days, respectively, around the publication. The estimation window is ½ 70; 11. Figures are in percent. Data on ESG news are from Covalence EthicalQuote. The sample is composed of 100 companies considered between 2002 and 2010. *, **, *** indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, 1% level respectively.

Overall, ordinary ESG disclosures impact firm’s market value, but mainly negatively. In support of hypothesis #1, the cumulative average abnormal return in a 3-day (10-day) event window is -0.085% (-0.139%) for negative events and +0.016% (+0.035%) for positive events for the full sample. The magnitude of the impact is low, but it is significant at the 1% level for negative events; in contrast, as stated in hypothesis #2, the average change in firm’s market value around the publication of positive ESG news is barely significant. Accordingly, while shareholders seem to penalize bad corporate social responsibility, they do not really reward positive behaviors. Figure 2 shows the daily cumulative average abnormal returns over a 20-day time window around the publication of negative or positive ESG events. This figure clearly illustrates the significant declines in stock price for firms that were targets of negative ESG news. Meanwhile, the trend for positive ESG news is unclear. This asymmetry is in line with most of the previous literature (except Flammer 2013). Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn (2011) even find that voluntary certifications such as Climate Leaders and Ceres generate market penalties. Thus, ESG investments are not always perceived as profitable by the stock markets.

Note that this first set of results holds when we consider alternative specifications: with a restricted sample that excludes events for which abnormal returns are likely to be misspecified (i.e., when parameters of the market model are jointly not significant), with or without sectoral indexes, with a longer estimation window cleaned of contaminating events, or with the Fama-French 4 factors. Those results are available on request.

The only source of ESG news that seems relevant for shareholders is the media (hypothesis #3). Negative ESG news disclosed by the media generate significant losses. In a 3-day (10-day) event window, these news caused cumulative average abnormal returns of -0.092% (-0.137%), which represent an average loss of $0.25 ($0.37) per share. Not surprisingly, firm’s press releases are not market movers. Most striking, albeit consistent with some concerns about their lack of credibility, the financial impact of ESG news published by NGOs are not significant. Confronted to a profusion of competing daily news, investors may react strongly to a disclosure that is not genuinely new (Huberman and Regev 2001). NGOs’ disclosures may influence media information (Capelle-Blancard and Petit 2017), while only media information directly influence investors. Considering this, the indirect impact of NGOs on stock markets remains a potential field of research.

# Every Little Helps? ESG News and Stock Market Reaction

Subsequently, given the previous findings, we only consider negative events published by the media and the event windows that catch the best the impact on the stock markets ([-1;?1] and [-5;?5]).

# Regression Analysis of CAR

Table 3 shows the results of several models regressing changes in firm’s market value related to negative ESG news published by the media, on a set of independent variables capturing certain characteristics of the news or the targeted firm. Changes in firm’s market value are expressed as a percentage variation from expected returns over a 3-day period (CAR½ 1;þ1) and a 10-day period (CAR½ 5;þ5). Columns 1, 2, 5 and 6 include company fixed effects to capture idiosyncrasies. We measure the impact of sectors’ and companies’ reputation and greenwashing with the past disclosures on their ESG activities. As we are mostly interested in analyzing the effect of reputation and greenwashing between firms and sectors, we do not include these variables in specifications including company fixed effects. Therefore, columns 3, 4, 7 and 8 only include HQs’ country fixed effects. All regressions include White-corrected robust standard errors.

# Source

The nature of the media has very little influence on the magnitude of the shareholders’ reaction to negative ESG news, which is consistent with the efficient market hypothesis (hypothesis #4a for leading financial newspapers and #4b for CSR specialized media). Nevertheless, this question should be further investigated, with more specific data on sources, to study the dynamics of information reports by different sources.

# E, S, G?

The literature did not provide clear ideas on what dimension of CSR should be, a priori, the most important for shareholders. Our results suggest that the average impact of negative ESG news is similar whether it concerns environmental issues, social issues or corporate governance issues. We hypothesized also that the impact of ESG news might be larger when the event is associated with a main concern for the firm (hypothesis #5). The effect is not significant, and it appears that shareholders attach as much.

Table 10 in ‘‘Appendix’’ section only considers cumulative abnormal returns significant at the 1% level. Table 11 uses a larger estimation window ½ 130; 11 which is ‘‘decontaminated’’ (the days when a firm experiments ESG events were removed from the estimation windows).

We do not find that the coefficient on the time trend is significantly negative (i.e., the loss gets stronger over time). While the number of ESG news covered by the media has increased (see Fig. 5), the perception of ESG events has not really changed during the last decade. External pressure to become socially responsible is similar, and firms have not been increasingly penalized by shareholders when they experienced negative ESG news (hypothesis #6). This result might appear inconsistent with Flammer (2013), but remember that we consider only 8 years (2002–2010), while Flammer (2013) considers three decades (1980–2009).

We also posited that shareholders’ attitude toward ESG news might be impacted by the crisis (hypothesis #7). We do not find any significant impact, either positive or negative.

# Past Disclosures: Reputation and Greenwashing

Our results suggest that a sector’s ESG reputation could act as a shield against potential shareholders’ losses (hypothesis #8a). Indeed, the more positive the past media coverage on a sector’s ESG issues, the lower the loss due to a negative ESG news. This confirms the ‘‘reservoir of goodwill’’ hypothesis, at a sectoral level at least. The result is barely significant when considering firm’s reputation compared to its peers (hypothesis #8b), which is in line with most of the previous literature.

Are firms able to mediate the impact of adverse ESG events by disclosing their own positive ESG news (hypothesis #9)? The answer seems to be yes: the more ESG communications firms issued in the preceding year, the lower the impact of negative news on stock market performance. Public relations, which could include greenwashing, are useful to reduce the direct financial penalties in times of trouble. However, the long-run dynamics of the strategic interactions between companies, NGOs and the media are ambiguous and should be the subject of further investigations. Public relations influence shareholders, but.

Similarly, we also tested whether upcoming weekend (the so-called Friday effect) or holidays distract shareholders from ESG issues (DellaVigna and Pollet 2009), but we did not find any impact as well. We have also controlled for the total amount of news reported in the Dow Jones Factiva database (therefore, including non-ESG news), which can be considered as a proxy of limited attention of shareholders (Hirshleifer et al. 2009); the results were not significant.

firms which claim to be virtuous are more scrutinized by the media and the watchdogs, which could be double-edged.

# Content Analysis

As expected, the tone of the articles clearly influences the impact of ESG news on firms’ market value (hypotheses #10). We find that articles including quantitative words tend to be associated with larger losses. The impact is also amplified when articles include an economic vocabulary, albeit to a lower extent. The literature has already shown that the content of financial news influences the stock markets (see for example Schumaker and Chen 2009, or Kogan et al. 2013). Our results confirm recent findings (Krueger 2015) highlighting the relevance of content analysis of extra-financial news.

# Out of Sight, Out of Mind?

Cultural distance affects the impact of ESG news (hypothesis #11). Previous papers have shown that within a country, investors overweight domestic firms20. Heath and Tversky (1991) explain this phenomenon by an aversion to ambiguity where investors infer beliefs from preferences. In line with the literature on the domestic bias, our results suggest that when events take place in countries sharing the same official language with the involved company headquarters, they have more financial impact. Interestingly, the effect of cultural distance is lower when considering the ½ 5; þ5 event window compared to the ½ 1; þ1 event window. This may suggest another interpretation: events occurring in countries sharing less proximity with headquarters have a similar impact, but shareholders take more time to assimilate this information and incorporate it into prices. Note that we did not find such results for the geographical distance.21

# Conclusion

Investors and analysts have access to more information than ever on firms’ behavior toward environmental, social and corporate governance issues. And whether they like it or not, corporate executives have to take into account CSR concerns, if only to improve financial performance and lower risks. This paper examines the stock markets reaction to ESG news gathered in the Covalence EthicalQuote database which includes, after several filters, more than 30,000 occurrences concerning 100 listed companies over the period 2002–2010. It means that we do not only consider extreme events, but also very ordinary events. Our results first point out that shareholders react to the publication of ESG news.

21In a previous version, we tested whether the impact of ESG news depends on the country where the event took place; in particular, we distinguished developed and developing countries. On the one hand, the impact should be higher for negative events if they occur in developed countries compared to developing ones, because of environmental liability rules or the stringency of regulation. On the other hand, due to the difference of media coverage, small events are more likely to be reported in developed countries. We did not observe any significant differences.

ESG news, but mainly (not to say only) to negative ESG news. While the change in firm’s market value on a window of 3 days around the publication of negative ESG news is about 0.1% on average, the impact of positive ESG news is barely significant. This loss due to negative ESG events is mitigated when the targeted firms have previously disclosed more positive ESG information than their peers and when the sector has a good ESG reputation. In contrast, the loss is amplified when the news has a quantitative and economic orientation, and when there is a feeling of emotional closeness between the event and the firm.

Many directions could be explored to improve this study. The most visible extension could be to implement more sophisticated approaches for the computation and the analysis of abnormal returns. But more fundamentally, there is a lack of information to proxy the extent of the event. As the previous papers on CSR events, we consider all news equally. Indeed, we have no way to distinguish a priori the most striking events. As such, the media audience could be interesting to investigate, considering that the more media coverage, the heavier the financial losses due to negative ESG events. Moreover, if the Covalence EthicalQuote database provides remarkable research possibilities on CSR, it could be improved with systematic and automatic requests. This would allow notably to deepen the lexical analysis with other categories. Finally, it could be interesting to refine the analysis of reputation and greenwashing.

Abstract: Given that corporate leaders seek to ensure the long-term sustainability of their organization, this study explores how a business adopting a Thai Sufficiency Economy philosophy improves its sustainability performance. Adopting the Sufficiency Thinking model as the research framework, this study uses a qualitative research approach with a set of different data collection techniques to explore a sample Small–Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) called Plan Creation. Collected data are identified as themes, according to the Sufficiency Thinking model. Our findings reveal that there is a close fit between the collected data and the Sufficiency Thinking model. Virtuous attributes, individual and shared knowledge and the decision-making framework of Sufficiency Mindset are observed through the sustainable leadership actions, leading to, among other things, social and environmental innovation. Implications for practicing managers and directions for future research are also discussed.

Keywords: sustainable leadership; SMEs; organization; sustainability; corporate sustainability; sufficiency economy; SEP

# 1. Introduction

A great number of social scientists globally [1–9] have been on their search since the 1980s for an alternative to the mainstream U.S. business model that opts for maximizing short-term shareholder value, arguably leading to corporate bankruptcy. According to social scientists, the prevailing approach is fundamentally flawed, and does not lead to the wellbeing and happiness that human being desires. What then represents a different option?

Corporate sustainability is defined as “Meeting the needs of firm’s direct and indirect stakeholders, such as shareholders, employees, clients, pressure groups, communities without compromising its ability to meet the needs of future stakeholders as well” [10] (p. 131). In a time of uncertainty and complexity, organizations strive to survive and sustain themselves. In a quest for an approach to do so, several concepts have gained interest from practitioners. In Thailand, the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) is recognized as a philosophical approach to sustainable development [3]. A recent bibliometric review [11] has also indicated that the Sufficiency Economy philosophy is a school of thought in Asia on sustainable organization management. Internationally, SEP is also fundamental to the theory of corporate sustainability [12]. However, much is still unknown empirically about the Sufficiency Economy philosophy in business organizations. Thus, the focal research question of this study is how systematically business organizations adopt the Sufficiency Economy philosophy to improve their sustainability performance.

Consequently, the present study’s objective is to explore how corporate leaders practically ensure their organizational sustainability. The following section reviews the empirical and conceptual literature.

specifically on the philosophy of Sufficiency Economy. Relevant literature on sustainability performance is also reviewed. Then, the overall research methodology used in this study is described. We proceed by introducing our sample Small–Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) named Plan Creation or PlanToys. We conclude this paper by introducing some important recommendations drawn from the findings for practicing managers and business leaders and future research directions for researchers.

# 2. Background Literature

Knowledge of a whole SEP approach to corporate sustainability is very limited, even though the corporate sustainability topic has gained enormous interest from scholars and practitioners around the globe [ 13 –17 ]. This section presents the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP) formulated by His Majesty King Rama IX of Thailand as a whole approach to corporate sustainability. The philosophy is unofficially translated below [7] (p. 128).

“Sufficiency Economy is a philosophy that stresses the middle path as an overriding principle for appropriate conduct by the populace at all levels. This applies to conduct starting from the level of families to communities and to the nation in terms of development and administration, so as to modernize in line with the forces of globalization. “Sufficiency” means moderation, reasonableness, and the need for self-immunity to protect from impacts arising from internal and external change. To achieve sufficiency, an application of knowledge with due consideration and prudence is essential. In particular, great care is needed in the utilization of theories and methodologies for planning and implementation in every step. At the same time, it is essential to strengthen the moral fiber of the nation, so that everyone, particularly public officials, academics, and business people at all levels, adhere first and foremost to the principles of honesty and integrity. In addition, a way of life based on patience, perseverance, diligence, wisdom and prudence is indispensable in creating balance and in coping appropriately with critical challenges arising from extensive and rapid socioeconomic, environmental, and cultural changes in the world.”

His Majesty King Rama IX of Thailand derived the philosophy of Sufficiency Economy from his accumulated wisdom and insights throughout his 58 years of the throne [18]. His Majesty emphasized the “middle” path as the universal principle to life for Thai people at all levels and domains of application. The philosophy allows for a strategy for the nation to balance the national development and to deal with external forces. It emphasizes the requirement for adequate protection from shocks from inside and outside the nation. His Majesty reiterated the philosophy, after the 1997 economic crisis in Asia, in which countless large businesses and SMEs in Thailand went bankrupt, as the national strategy to economic recovery leading to a more resilient economy [ 19 ]. The philosophy is indeed responding to a call among corporate sustainability scholars for a new stakeholder-focus theory of the firm [20–24].

Sufficiency suggests three core principles of moderation, reasonableness, and resilience [7] and two underlying conditions of knowledge and virtues [7]. His Majesty emphasized the necessity of prudence in planning and its implementation, and carefulness in applying relevant knowledge. As for the virtues, Sufficiency Economy demands that people live their lives with the virtuous values of perseverance, harmlessness and generosity. They must adopt the honesty and integrity principles to be sustainable. Comparatively, the philosophy of the Sufficiency Economy highlights virtuous values and morality as fundamental to sustainable management, consistent with the Stakeholder theory of the west [25].

Kantabutra et al. [ 26 ] pioneered SEP research into the business organization by qualitatively exploring the corporate leadership practices among publicly listed companies in Thailand. These companies are market leaders and survived major crises. The practices were derived as the Sufficiency Economy Leadership Practices (SELP). The practices, their example supporting tools and techniques, and impact on corporate sustainability [27] (p. 4) are described in Table 1 below.

|Practice Titles|Sufficiency Economy Leadership Practices|Example Supporting Tools/Techniques|Effects on Corporate Sustainability|Relevant Sufficiency Economy Principles|
|---|---|---|---|---|

This includes anticipation of future trends and changes, and investment in people and the organization to prepare for future change.|Short and long term planning; Feasibility study; Contingency planning.|Capacity to respond to environmental changes and to manage risks.|Moderation, Reasonableness and Resilience|
|2. Gradual expansion|Expand the business carefully, although doing so may limit short-term profitability.|Feasibility study; Competition and industry analysis.|Minimized risks, ready to respond to environmental changes.|Moderation and Resilience|

Promotion from within the organization is given priority.|Training need analysis; succession planning; Management By Walking Around; Employee satisfaction index; Organizational climate survey.|High level of innovation and capacity to respond to unexpected environmental changes.|Moderation, Reasonableness and Morality|
|5. Strong culture|Develop a strong organizational culture, characterized by ethics, perseverance, diligence and innovation.|Vision communication; company poems and songs; Ceremonies; Shared events such as “Creative Saturday”.|Organizational effectiveness.|Knowledge and Morality|
|6.

Extending the previous research [24,26], a prior study [27] quantitatively examined associations between business practices according to the SEP and sustainability performance, using a sample of 112 Thai businesses. Findings indicate that the practices are significantly predictive of improved sustainability performance. A later study [5] was conducted to confirm these findings in a larger sample of 294 businesses from different industries in Thailand. The latter findings indicate that business practices consistent with SEP improved corporate sustainability performance. These practices were called sharing, geosocial development, perseverance, resilience and moderation, later informing the development of a theory of corporate sustainability [12]. The findings of the previous studies [5, 27] also endorse the prior findings by Kantabutra et al. [26]. In conclusion, the Sufficiency Economy Philosophy is empirically endorsed as an approach to corporate sustainability.

In 2016, there was a significant development in moving the Sufficiency Economy philosophy forward in the scholarly community. A group of scholars who worked in the SEP areas came together and inductively developed a model called “Sufficiency Thinking” shown in Figure 1 [28] (p. 52) the research framework for the present exploration. The Sufficiency Thinking model describes the theoretical process from virtues to well-being sustainability.

Figure 1. The Sufficiency Thinking model [28] (p. 52).

The Sufficiency Thinking model [28] begins with virtuous individuals which together develop shared virtues in an organization over time. The next model element is the knowledge that individuals bring into the organization, which over time becomes shared knowledge. Virtuous and knowledgeable individuals are not sufficient to sustain an organization. They are required to have a certain mindset to guide their decision-making process in order to respond effectively to the internal and external environments. This mindset is called “Sufficiency Mindset”. Such a mindset is informed by the moderation, reasonableness and prudence principles. Before deciding, one must acquire the necessary knowledge while taking into consideration its consequences on all possible stakeholders. In other words, one must adhere to the ethical and virtuous principles in making such a decision. Next, the behavioral consequence of such the decision-making process is called 23 sustainable leadership practices or 23 work principles. The 23 sustainable leadership practices [29] (pp. 27–36) are adopted in the present study as demonstrated in Table 2 below. More explanations about each of the practices can be found in Avery and Bergsteiner [2].

|Leadership Elements|Sustainable Leadership Philosophy|Shareholder-First Philosophy|
|---|---|---|
|Foundation practices|Sophisticated, stakeholder, social, sharing|Tough, ruthless, asocial, profit-at-any-cost|
|1. Developing people|Develops everyone continuously|Develops everyone selectively|
|2. Labor relations|Seek cooperation|Acts antagonistically|
|3. Retaining staff|Values long tenure at all levels|Accepts high staff turnover|
|4. Succession planning|Promotes from within wherever possible|Appoints from outside wherever possible|
|5. Valuing staff|Is concerned about employees’ welfare|Treats people as interchangeable and a cost|
|6. CEO and top team|CEO works as top team member or speaker|CEO is decision maker, hero|
|7. Ethical behavior|“Doing-the-right-thing” as an explicit core value|Ambivalent, negotiable, an assessable risk|
|8. Long- or short-term perspective|Prefers the long-term over the short-term|Short-term profits and growth prevail|
|9. Organizational change|Change is an evolving and considered process|Change is fast adjustment, volatile, can be ad hoc|
|10. Financial markets orientation|Seeks maximum independence from others|Follows its masters’ will, often slavishly|
|11. Responsibility for environment|Protects the environment|Is prepared to exploit the environment|
|12. Social responsibility (CSR)|Values people and the community|Exploits people and the community|
|13. Stakeholders|Everyone matters|Only shareholders matter|

# 3. Methodology

To gain a deep understanding of how a business adopts a Thai Sufficiency Economy philosophy to improve its sustainability performance, a qualitative approach is used to explore how corporate leaders ensure organizational sustainability. Figure 2 presents the research methodology process. We start with a literature review relevant to the Sufficiency Economy philosophy and corporate sustainability. The search keywords include sustainability, sufficiency economy, corporate sustainability, social enterprise, and sustainable enterprise without a specific timeframe.

|Literature review|Questions development|Multi-data collection|Data analysis|
|---|---|---|---|
|Observation|Stakeholder interviews|Documentation|Coding adopting the Sufficiency Thinking model|

Then, a set of open-ended questions is developed since we want to explore how corporate leaders practically ensure their organizational sustainability. In order to answer the research question, a case sample of a Thai small and medium enterprise is used. The case sample named “Plan Creation or PlanToys” was purposively selected because this organization has adopted the SEP concept according to Thailand’s Office of the Royal Development Projects Board (ORDPB). Interviewees, including stakeholders, were purposively sampled to provide answers to relevant aspects and questions. Stakeholders were face-to-face interviewed, including the Managing Director, ten department managers, ten employees, three customers and six people living in the nearby communities.

The Managing Director was asked about how he led and managed his organization. The ten department managers were interviewed about the management practices of their relevant departments. The ten employees were interviewed about the business practices and quality of life at work, while the three customers and six people from the surrounding communities were interviewed about their experience with the sample SME. These informants are chosen on a convenient basis. Probing, reflective note-taking, critical incident technique and non-participant observations were used during two visits to the company to improve data validity. All interviews were tape-recorded with permission from the interviewees and from the sample company. All recorded interviews were transcribed into a text-based document. Secondary data from other sources such as media reports and Facebook were also collected.

We adopt the triangulation approach to data collection to ensure an acceptable level of validity and objectivity. In doing so, we concurrently improve the rigor of the present study as it allows us to draw rich data from a set of various perspectives from multiple data collection techniques and different actors from different organizational levels as well as key actors from outside the organization such as external stakeholders.

As for data analysis, qualitative data collection and analysis generally take place simultaneously as researchers try to draw meaning and develop understanding slowly over time in a non-linear manner. By design, we therefore transcribe the interviews by ourselves. We adopt the deductive approach by choosing the framework approach to qualitative data analysis that involves coding the qualitative data based on a theoretically and empirically pre-determined research framework (Figure 2) since we can anticipate the likely responses from the interviewees based on the literature. This framework approach has been used to manage and analyze qualitative data since the 1980s [29] as it helps researchers to focus the coding on those critical issues in the extant literature. The framework approach is also relevant to our cross-sectional analysis with descriptive data as it allows us to see different aspects of the observed phenomena under examination [29]. In doing so, our interpretations of informants’ responses and experiences are transparent [29], and demonstrate the relationship between different stages of analysis [30,31]. With a series of interconnected stages, the framework approach also allows us to move back and forth across the data until we arrive at a coherent account [29].

In fact, we finally convert the research framework in Figure 2 into a working analytical framework to clearly demonstrate the relationship between the Sufficiency Thinking model and received respondents’ answers. As our analysis tool, this working analytical framework as shown in Table 3 comprises a set of codes grouped according to the research framework. The working analytical framework assists us in managing and organizing the data, acts as a new structure for the data, is useful for summarizing and minimizing the data, and supports us in investigating the research question.

|2|“The strength of the company in relation to community is the environmental concern. The company cooperates with the surrounding community. For example, the company provides a health checkup for people who live near the factory. In any special event, like Children’s day, Elderly’s day, the company also organizes activities for the community”.|Employee|Interview|Yes|No|Yes|Yes|Yes|Yes|

# 4. Plan Creation

Plan Creation Co. Ltd. or PlanToys was established in 1981 by seven university graduates with a dream to infuse the world with positive vibes. At that time, the company was led by Vitool Virapornsawan with a strong architectural and design background. At present, the company is run by the second generation, Kosin Virapornsawan, who shares the original vision and mission to create a sustainable world. The written vision of PlanToys is “Better Kids, Better World”, with a belief to run a stakeholder-friendly business. PlanToys has expanded its distribution channel overseas through partnerships in Asia, America, Europe and Australia. Their products are educational toys for kids of all ages, with a large variety of products. PlanToys is chosen as the sample for the present study because the company is endorsed by the three criteria of sustainable enterprise [1]. The company also delivers the cultural, social, environmental and economic outputs and outcomes of self-reliance, immunity and resilience [3].

With over 640 employees and 350 SKUs to toys in 2019, PlanToys has an average annual revenue of 388 million Baht (approximately 12.2 million USD) with a registered capital of 150 million Baht (approximately 4.7 million USD). PlanToys has survived several crises over the past decades, ranging from the 1997 economic crisis in Asia, the subprime crisis in 2008, and the sudden increase in minimum labor wage by the Thai government in 2012. With prudent financial and operational risks management, PlanToys survived these crises by receiving support from employees and all stakeholders without laying off a single employee. PlanToys has a strong brand image. Customers trust the brand and constantly purchase safety toys for their kids, continuously maintaining its market leadership in Thailand.

# 5. Discussions of the Findings

Our findings reveal that many practices at Plan Creation are consistent with the Sufficiency Thinking model. The virtuous values and knowledge are infused throughout the entire enterprise. Evidence is also clear about the corporate Sufficiency Mindset that informs the practices. In the section below, we do not categorize our discussions by the virtuous values, knowledge and Sufficiency Mindset, and sustainability practices in this order. Instead, we present the sustainable leadership practices found at Plan Creation. We also demonstrate in detail how these practices are influenced by the Virtues, Knowledge, Sufficiency Mindset. However, the resulting outputs and outcomes are discussed respectively in this order.

# 5.1. Sufficiency Thinking Practices

Virtues are being practiced at Plan Creation. A practicing virtue at Plan Creation is perseverance that forms a strong company culture, a sustainable leadership practice. Perseverance starts when employees first join the company.

“Most of our new employees are willing to learn the sufficiency thinking concept. Some of them are very enthusiastic and eager to learn new things. We prepare and support them for their career advancement. The company considers their background, performance, perseverance and other skills” (Marketing Officer)

As endorsed by the Perseverance predictor for corporate sustainability [5], perseverance at Plan Creation is a performance appraisal criterion. Performance evaluation is conducted annually, including other criteria as diligence, the ability to focus and deliver values. Perseverance at Plan Creation is seen clearly when it encounters a tough time. In the past crises, a united team of employees who exhibited an organizational citizenship behavior attitude at Plan Creation persisted despite a great obstacle to ensure corporate survival. Certainly, this enhances its corporate resilience.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

“At a time of crisis, we needed to reduce operating costs by reducing over time (OT) and to increase employees’ day offs, but there was no policy to reduce the number of staff. The top management team called for a meeting at the canteen to inform the situation to staff. At that time, there were not many staffs resigning. The staffs understood and were committed to ensuring the company’s survival." (HR Officer)

Consistent with the sustainable leadership practice of considered organizational change, Plan Creation constantly adapts to the changing business environment, including new opportunities to expand its market. When a market however is declining, Plan Creation also finds a new market as a replacement. Such a practice is consistent with the long-term orientation practice of sustainable enterprises [26]. In terms of products, Plan Creation always innovate to add values to customers and to ensure sustainable competitive advantage, endorsed by the sustainable leadership practice of innovation. Staff at Plan Creation usually come up with small and continuous innovation, including incremental process improvement and its resulting cost saving. It is clear that the sustainable leadership approach of the long-term perspective improves its corporate ability to immune itself from external shocks.

“Now we need to diversify our business to the new market, for example, toys for elderly, pets, and kids’ furniture. We need to plan for the new marketing strategy. Secondly, we need to change the selling platform. We have started with export, then wholesale and then will do more retail through online channel.” (Managing Director)

“At the factory, there is a machinery development department. Systematically, it is in charge of bringing in innovative ideas to improve production processes and products.” (HR Officer)

Perseverance at Plan Creation also reflects in its attempt to always adjust its standards to meet rising client expectations, consistent with the sustainable leadership practice of quality. They systematically consider and manage change here. Since more and more large clients prefer to set their own criteria for selecting suppliers, Plan Creation needs to be able to meet their demand. These demanding standards include ethical standards, environmental standards and production standards. Thus, “doing the right thing”, is an exhibited behavior among Plan Creation employees. Certainly, this behavior is in line with the sustainable leadership practice of ethical behavior.

“PlanToys products help to support child development very well. I feel very confident in letting my children plays with PlanToys products because it made from the wood with high quality of standards. I would prefer my children playing with wooden toys rather than plastic toys.” (Customer A)

“I have PlanToys on our office desk. When we are stressful, we can play them. PlanToys usually helps us to think of innovative ideas.” (Customer B)

Consistent with the sustainable leadership practices of stakeholder focus, social responsibility and knowledge management, sharing is the next practicing virtue at Plan Creation as demonstrated in its living core values. This virtuous value of sharing impacts many business activities [5] here as discussed below.

“Learning is the key success factor for our company. Our management team has paid attention to sharing. For example, knowledge sharing especially through the use of internet to disseminate PlanToys’ knowledge. The company has a lot of knowledge, but they are all over the place. We actually have an idea to put everything about PlanToys in the website. With the search function, users everywhere can easily search and acquire useful information.” (Managing Director)

Plan Creation really “shares”, as endorsed by the corporate sustainability predictor of sharing [5].

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

“Employees here have a very kind heart. They are friendly, supportive and considerate. Sharing with others and sharing to the society are one of the most important core corporate values.” (Plant Director)

“We always support each other as it is part of our core values. If we work at Plan Toy and meet other employees outside the company, we always help each other. At PlanToys, everyone is equal. There is no competition among us. We are friends and family.” (HR Officer)

“Externally, we always exchange and share knowledge with people in our community. Every year, there are groups of visitors and students visiting our company. Students are always interested and ask questions. This is considered an imperative way of knowledge sharing.” (HR Officer)

“Internally, not only we provide training to employee, but also on Wednesday morning we have a shared event called “Fresh Up in the Morning” for managers to share new knowledge or new experience for about 15 min. Department managers take turn to speak to all employees.” (Plant Director)

“If any educational institution is interested in learning more about PlanToys, our top management is willing to be a speaker to students because we would like to share our success and failure stories to others. We strongly believe that our knowledge and experience is beneficial to the society. We are happy to share good practices that can further help to develop some sort of good business models for other organizations. We do not prohibit information sharing.” (Marketing Officer)

With a Sharing policy, knowledge is shared throughout the organization, enabling Plan Creation to rely on the organizational system, as opposed to a few individual Gate Keepers. Endorsed by the sustainable leadership practices of valuing people, developing people continuously and long-term employee retention, PlanToys gives its people priority. Avoiding staff layoffs, Plan Creation preserves firm-specific knowledge and skills embedded in employees, most of which have worked for Plan Creation for a long time. During an economic downturn, these firm-specific knowledge and skills have helped the company to get back on track with the market demand in a timely manner, enhancing corporate resilience. Externally, the company supports educational visits. Depending on which aspect Plan Creation shares, the sharing practice has helped the company to develop a stronger capacity to bring about the quadruple sustainability outputs.

“When there is a job vacancy, the company always gives an opportunity to internal staff first. If anyone is interested in this new position, s/he can apply and go through the recruitment process. If we cannot fill in the position with internal staff, then the company makes a job posting and announcement for outsiders.” (Production officer A)

Also in line with the sustainable leadership practice of knowledge retention and sharing, knowledge at Plan Creation, as one of the two basic conditions of the Sufficiency Economy philosophy, is manifested through its living corporate values. Endorsed by the resilience predictor for corporate sustainability [5], knowledge at Plan Creation is exceptional since it results in many innovations. Plan Creation strictly adheres to a manufacturing policy of exceeding customer requirements all the time. It ensures the highest quality and safety and delivers products on time. Technologies are improved continuously to ensure the highest level of cost efficiency so that it can set a competitive price and allow for maximum flexibility. Clearly, quality is part of its corporate culture. For example, the company developed a chemical-free kiln to dry the wood, followed by the use of water-based dyes, non-formaldehyde glue and organic color pigment to ensure the highest safety of toys for kids and for employees in the company.

“We incorporate innovation in our products. Many people ask about the sufficiency economy philosophy. They wonder why we pay attention to innovation which seems to be the opposite of the sufficiency economy. We explain that it is not true. Sufficiency Economy is the philosophy to run business sustainably. To survive in business, we need to differentiate our company. Innovation is the solution to our business. Innovation can be incorporated into design, function, or materials.” (Managing Director)

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

Market analysis is carried out at Plan Creation on a continuous basis to guide innovations to ensure its corporate alignment with the changing market needs. Plan Creation’s innovations are frequently built upon its strong expertise in utilizing local and simple materials. Typically, the company develops a new product from in-house materials, which often means a partial use of its existing manufacturing equipment. Thai wisdom is also a foundation for most innovations at Plan Creation.

“PlanToys located at the downstream of the supply chain. Upstream involved with growing rubberwood trees for latex. After 25 years, rubberwood trees can no longer produce latex. In the past, they were cut and burned. PlanToys is the first company which turns unused rubberwood into toys . . . In terms of product design, the founders of the company paid attention to the design. In designing, we incorporate innovation in our new eco-friendly material which comprises non-toxic composite wood from sawdust and wasted wood to make. This material is called Plan wood.” (Managing Director)

It is evident that the knowledge value influences the innovation practice at Plan Creation. However, knowledge and innovation at Plan Creation benefit not only themselves, but a range of stakeholders including its industry competitors. Plan Creation’s innovation and sharing practices allow the company to continue to incrementally and radically innovate, enhancing its own sustainability prospect.

Plan Creation clearly adopts the moderation principle of the Sufficiency Economy philosophy. Essentially, the moderation principle can be seen in action here, as informed by virtuous values and knowledge at all organizational levels.

“Our products have a small margin. We emphasize on quality, and we invest heavily in quality and safety which is the cause of the very small margin. Fortunately, our products were well sold in the market. Our goal is not only to make profits, but also to keep our employees work happily every day by delivering value to our customers.” (Managing Director)

Adopting the moderation principle, Plan Creation, as opposed to maximizing the wealth of the owners, has increased its sales volume in a “stakeholder-friendly” manner, consistent with the sustainable leadership practices of long-term stakeholder value and independence from financial markets where maximization of short-term shareholder value is the focus. This policy is clearly endorsed by the moderation predictor for corporate sustainability identified [5].

“There was a time when we wanted to double our target growth within the next 3 years. To achieve such an aggressive target, our growth rate must be 20–25% for the first year. We used the price to drive the market. In turn, our sales volume decreased although we provided promotions and discounts. We did not even achieve the target in the first year. From that year, we realized that we should not grow aggressively. Some years, the more we sold our products, the more we made loss. Our sales volume was high, but we made more loss because our capacity was limited. We increased overtime, which in turn led to lower productivity. Finally, it was not worth to do so. Eventually, we rethink how to create a more balance for our company.” (Managing Director)

With the moderation principle, future problems and crises can be prevented or their effects can be minimized since Plan Creation can respond more effectively to them. A prudent practice at Plan Creation is for example a policy to utilizing internal capital to ensure maximum independence to continue its operation both in the short and long run. In doing so, Plan Creation improves its corporate self-reliance. Its current proportion of external sources of capital are 1.9 times of internal source of capital. The company also adopts the moderation principle in its sourcing practice. Plan Creation sources materials timely, given its collective insights in a highly cyclical market and a long-lasting bond with local suppliers. The supplies are kept in a well-maintained warehouse, creating a backup for the company when there is an abrupt change in the supply market. In addition, cash flows are managed very carefully here to ensure a high degree of independence from financial institutions via its long-termed, trusted relationship with the local suppliers.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

“Our material is rubberwood from the supplier which is our subsidiary company. We have a high standard and strict requirements not to use chemical in the wood. This chemical-free wood is not easy to find from other suppliers in the market. It has to be made-to-order. We create a standard contract for suppliers which clearly states our requirements.” (Finance Officer)

“The Moderation, Prudent concepts and strategic direction came from the President. The President has driven these concepts for our company not to aim to be listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand, unlike the approach other typical companies usually adopt. For a listed company, the company needs to focus on maximizing profitability for shareholders alone, but our company aims to be “People’s Company”. We would like to provide different things to all of our employees. We do not want the highest sale volumes. Everything shall be optimized. A high revenue may lead to a high cost. Sharing per staff may be less. Employees may have to work more. This will not benefit anyone at last.” (Managing Director)

Adopting the Prudence and Reasonableness principles, Plan Creation invests very carefully. Long-term oriented, Plan Creation invests only in a project that has the potential to deliver benefits in the long run. At a time where a significant investment project is considered, for example, the acquisition of new equipment, the top management team on a consensual decision-making basis needs to choose whether an existing machine can be upgraded or a new one is needed. Usually, upgrading is the most desirable option. Equipment will be acquired only when the existing equipment cannot be adapted or modified, because new equipment usually needs a large investment not only to install it but also to adjust it to fit with the entire existing operational processes and procedures. A well-thought practice such as this permits Plan Creation to maintain lower costs in the long run. Certainly, it enables Plan Creation to always compete better in the market.

In terms of business expansion, typical companies expand to maximize profits. However, business expansion is considered very carefully at Plan Creation. As a team, the company decides to expand only when it is clear to deliver long-term returns. In general, Plan Creation pilots the expansion first. The company continues to invest on a bigger scale only when the initial investment demonstrates a clear likelihood of long-term growth. A prudent development such as this has helped Plan Creation to protect itself from environmental shocks that may have brought about a great difficulty.

“Other competitors went out of business because they did not have a strong brand or did not apply the Sufficiency Economy philosophy in their operations. There was a time when we received a contract from another company to expand our business, but we decided not to expand our factory. Nevertheless, our competitor expanded its business, which hurt them significantly during the (1997 Asian Economic) crisis.” (Marketing Officer)

Manifestly, the Sufficiency Mindset as endorsed by virtues and knowledge has affected the organizational practices at Plan Creation. Endorsed by the geosocial development predictor [5], Plan Creation runs its business with a keen sense of ethical responsibility to the best interests of its broad range of stakeholders. Concurrently, Plan Creation is deeply aware of all possible impacts it can create for the environment. Adopting the sustainable leadership practices of social and environmental responsibility, the company considers integrating the social and environmental responsibility into its business as something that brings a competitive advantage to the company. Obviously, this mindset leads to improving its corporate capacity to deliver the quadruple bottom line outputs.

“PlanToys pays attention to community and well-being of people in neighborhood. The company takes good care of the environment around the factory. We do not have problems of waste water or smell. PlanToys always collaborates with the community; especially if we request or propose any ideas, the company always supports our ideas to improve our environment around the factory.” (Community leader)

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

“The company manages the environment and society around factory and community well. We can breathe easily. There was one time, our head of community asked for support in drug testing in people who live in community. The company and employees supported and collaborated well to ensure we lived in drug-free community.” (Villager A)

“We used to request the company to help build a road and dig a canal for our community. The company was happy to help us.” (Villager B)

Plan Creation gives priority to the employees whom it considers as family members, demonstrating amicable labor relations. Consistent with the sustainable leadership practice of internal succession planning, the company prefers insider managers wherever possible to make sure the corporate culture and business operation continue smoothly. Plan Creation heavily invests in leadership development. As a result, employees can replace each other when needed. Without disruption, the company can continue to produce the highest quality products. This is a demonstration of self-reliance and organizational immunity at Plan Creation.

“We happily work and live like a family here. We have handicap staff who are visually impaired and they work here for more than 20 years.” (Staff A)

“I trust my supervisor 100%. She knows everything about me. I can talk to her about my personal life. For example, my child got sick, my debt. The company has a very good system. Other employees can help to support my work during my absence. I used to take 45 days maternity leave. All the work ran smoothly without any problems.” (Production offer B)

To nurture a team culture and to transfer the shared organizational vision, values and culture, a “Buddy” system is set up to pair a new employee with a senior one, consistent with the sustainable leadership practice of strong, shared vision. In such a widely shared corporate culture, employee motivation and productivity are high, enhancing corporate capacity to deliver economic performance.

To ensure the highest safety for its end users, often kids, Plan Creation manufactures its products guided by the top international quality standard via its supply chain. Maintaining a good and trusted relationship with its long-term suppliers, the company source the highest quality supplies and materials. To improve productivity, Plan Creation also recognizes motivation needs among its employees such as healthcare, scholarships for their children. Indeed, a sense of trust and teamwork is created in the organization. These practices assist Plan Creation to improve its organizational capacity to deliver the quadruple bottom line outputs.

“We have a long-term relationship with PlanToys. We received a special request from PlanToys for a special size of wood. PlanToys emphasizes on safety and chemical-free raw materials because this wood will be the toys for kids. Kids may put the toys into their mouth. Therefore safety and quality are the highest concern. We adjusted and improved our production process to ensure the wood is free from moth. We also enhanced our drying system.” (Supplier A)

Adopting the shared virtues, Plan Creation has contributed to the community it operates in different ways. This contribution helps the surrounding community to understand Plan Creation better. Such enhanced understanding helps to prevent a problem such as protesting stemmed from the surrounding community.

“We have regularly organized CSR activities. We promote a reforestation campaign with the community. We also regularly organize a reforestation activity every year by involving people in the community. We act as a role model for people in our community.” (Plant Manager)

“The strength of the company in relation to community is the environmental concern. The company cooperates with the surrounding community. For example, the company provides a health checkup for people who live near the factory. In any special event, like Children’s day, Elderly’s day, the company also organizes activities for the community.” (Employee)

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

“We arrange “Toy Museum” in which visitors can visit all year long. Especially during the Children’s day, PlanToys organizes many activities for children in the community to join.” (Marketing Officer)

In terms of social responsibility value, Thai traditions and culture are regarded as critical in lifting employees’ morale. Plan Creation has conducted traditional and religious ceremonies regularly for this purpose. In addition, local traditional and cultural activities are supported by the company, such as merit-making ceremonies or cremation services. Employees are also allowed to schedule their work so that they can leave to attend such ceremonies. Such a practice obviously leads to improving social and cultural outputs.

“Another activity is a meditation program that we open for all employees to join.” (HR Officer)

# 5.2. Measurable Outputs

Outputs from applying the Sufficiency Economy philosophy in an organization can be classified into four important groups: economic output, environmental output, and social and cultural outputs [3].

In terms of economic outputs, Plan Creation has demonstrated continuous growth in performance. The company has continued to provide sustainable returns for shareholders and stakeholders with an increasing rate from 2013 to 2017. According to the public data from the Department of Business Development, Ministry of Commerce, Thailand, Plan Creation was the leader with the highest market share in its industry between 2013 and 2017. The average total income over that period was 379.6 Million THB, which was better than those top three competitors in the same industry (158.8 million, 121.6 million, 83.4 million THB). The five-year average net profit of Plan Creation was also the highest in the industry, i.e., 5.3 million THB, compared with those top three competitors in the same industry (3.7 million, 0.78 million, −5.2 million). The company has also improved operational efficiency. For example, the company reduced its production cost by approximately 10 percent in 2017 by relocating its factory to a southern province of Thailand close to the source of raw materials (e.g., rubberwood).

In terms of environmental outputs, the company can bring about lower waste emissions. It can also reduce the ratio of real wood usage by 32%. Subsequently, the use of wood chips helps to reduce waste emission even further. Table 4 below compares the proportion and cost of raw materials of the company.

**Table 4. Comparison of raw materials by proportion and cost.**
|Raw Materials|Proportion of Real Wood|Cost (THB)/Kilogram|
|---|---|---|
|Plan wood|68%|13.75|
|Real wood|100%|20.13|

Moreover, carbon emission was also reduced significantly. The company has continuously collected data about the carbon emission rate since 2012. The carbon emission rate of the company was reduced from 2747.1 carbon ton in 2012 to 2140.5 carton ton in 2013. This is considered a more than 20% reduction rate. After real wood was replaced by Plan wood, the ratio of carbon was reduced by 53.75% as demonstrated in Table 5.

**Table 5. Raw materials and carbon emission of Planwood.**
|Raw Materials|Number of Tree Used Per Year|Carbon Emission Per Year (Carbon kilogram)|
|---|---|---|
|Plan wood|1746|68,110|
|Real wood|808|31,500|

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

# 5.3. Envisaged Outcomes

Plan Creation relies on its own process of the supply chain. Starting with raw materials, the company uses local rubberwood from rubberwood trees in the southern part, which can no longer produce latex. It does not rely on imported materials or energy from overseas countries. The company emphasizes and also utilizes its core competency, which is product design. With its unique designs, Plan Creation has developed a strong brand identity for its own. Lastly, the company also has devised its own manufacturing processes. With unique designs, manufacturing processes and brand identity, it is difficult for competitors to imitate.

Plan Creation has demonstrated its organizational immunity. The company can survive the global financial crisis in 2007 by maintaining a gross profit at 6%, during which time its competitors were not profitable. More recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Pan Creation is not affected while other businesses in Thailand have been on the decline.

“We are not affected by the pandemic. As a matter of facts, our sales volume increases because we invested in building overseas factories and online channels.” (Managing Director)

Lastly, the company has demonstrated its organizational resilience via several crises. Notably, it could bound back from the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis within 3–4 years, while other companies could not survive.

In summary, our findings demonstrate a close fit between Plan Creation’s business practices and the Sufficiency Thinking model. We can conclude that the knowledge and virtuous values are the foundation of the Sufficiency Thinking mindset at Plan Creation. This shared mindset is characterized by moderation, reasonableness and prudence. It is this mindset that drives corporate practices that are consistent with sustainable leadership practices. Finally, there is evidence of the expected outputs of economic, environmental, cultural and social outputs and outcomes of self-reliance, resilience and immunity at Plan Creation. Contributing to the literature, the present study helps us to enhance our understanding of the corporate sustainability process.

# 6. Managerial Implications for SMEs

Our study offers some important implications for practicing managers particularly the SME owners who wish to sustain their business by adopting the Sufficiency Economy philosophy. SME business leaders should identify perseverance as a required value for new employees. The recruiting process should assess a candidate whether she/he has persisted in going through difficulties. Perseverance should also be a criterion in employee performance evaluation. Perseverant employees should be publicly recognized so that other employees understand management’s expected behavior.

In addition, SME owners should start by giving priority to product, service and process innovations. Starting with continuous marketing analysis, co-creation with users, suppliers, and relevant parties should be conducted to design products or to prove processes. Local wisdom or culture shall be integrated into the new product development process or operational improvement process.

Sustainability 2020, 12, 9204

Core competency shall be identified and maintained within its own companies rather than outsourcing them from others. Moreover, SME leaders should maintain a good, long-term relationship with stakeholders including suppliers, as they can be partners to develop innovative products and processes.

SME leaders should take into consideration the Sufficiency Economy philosophy by balancing between a short-term and long-term view. Risk management shall be considered along with prudent decision making to make an investment or expansion. Top management should focus on long-term sustainable growth, although in doing so, it may have to sacrifice short-term profits. A policy to give priority to utilize internal capital for expansion should be carefully reviewed and formulated.

Adopting a stakeholder focus approach, SME leaders should start by acting as a role model for employees. They should also be responsible for a broad range of stakeholders. They should also sponsor and participate in cultural and local activities in the nearby communities, and allow employees to join even during an office hour.

Finally, SME leaders should be willing to share their knowledge with a wide range of stakeholders, including competitors, to help to educate customers and suppliers along the value chain. Ultimately, the sharing practice helps to advance the relevant market, industry and society.

# 7. Future Research

Typical to a case study approach, the findings here are limited by a single case company. They should be further examined quantitatively via a larger sample size from a variety of different industrial and organizational settings. Moreover, future research may consider refining the Sufficiency Thinking model by adopting a robust theory building approach such as the Integrated Theory Building Methodology [12] to develop a theory of sustainable SME management.

# 8. Conclusions

Findings at Plan Creation endorse the Sufficiency Thinking model as an approach to ensure corporate sustainability. At the same time, it also endorses the Sufficiency Economy philosophy as a viable approach to corporate sustainability. The present study also demonstrates how the virtues, knowledge and Sufficiency Mindset have infused throughout the business activities at Plan Creation. The findings also indicate that adopting the Sufficiency Economy philosophy leads to cultural, social, environmental and economic outputs. Future research directions, including the development of a theory of sustainable SME management, were discussed. Finally, recommendations for practicing managers were pointed out.

# Abstract

Despite having a focus on sustainability policy planning, failures occur during the implementation process. The gap between policy and its implementation causes failures of the sustainability policy. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of the present study is to explore the factors that create hurdles in the implementation of corporate sustainability policy in letters and spirits. The study adopts a systematic literature review (SLR) approach and reviews all the possible studies from 1950 to 2019 published by six major publishing houses. These studies were found using selected keywords. The findings of SLR reveal governance, education, and SMEs as frequently appearing words while exploring corporate sustainability. The stakeholder theory and the institutional theory appear as the most cited theories in the sustainability literature. The grassroots approach, environmental impact assessment, integrated sustainability assessment, evidence-based practice approach, systematic approach, economical instrument policy approach, and consultant services approach appear as the most relevant approaches used for policymaking in corporate sustainability. The SLR findings reveal five significant factors that influence corporate sustainability policy implementation and can cause the gap between policy and its implementation. These factors are government institutions (including macro and meso-institutions), internal and external stakeholders, management, organizational barriers, and normative references.

# Introduction

Corporate sustainability (CS) has become a part of the business community’s vernacular worldwide. The origin of the CS concept is mainly linked to the Brundtland report (1987), which incorporates CS through the triple bottom line of long-term economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental responsibility into a company’s management and operations (Bansal 2005). Despite the effective policymaking on CS, its implementation is frequently questioned. Since the policymaking and implementation are two different realms (Galbreath 2009), both aspects need to be equally reinforced for productive results. Kotler (2001) mentioned that the policy’s implementation is the process of translating the policy into actions to achieve the organization’s objectives. Despite having a focus on sustainability policy planning, failures occur during the implementation process. The gap between policy and its implementation is one of the core reasons for sustainability policy’s failure. Further, since the policies are written documents, these cannot be implemented in the real organizational setting without clear understanding, interpretation, and communication down the line to the implementation team (Ménard et al. 2018).

Organizational policies for long-term growth give an apex position to sustainability (Perrini and Minoja 2008). The reason for the importance of CS in decision-making can be traced back to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, S. W. S 1987). The report titled “Our

Common Future considers sustainability as the key driver for the prosperous global future for present and future generations. The report strongly suggests the corporate sector to focus on sustainable policies to meet the need of the present generation without harming future generations’ ability to meet their own needs.

The challenges to corporate sustainability are continual and require exploring new sustainable approaches (Alexander 2020) to overcome them (Raja et al. 2019). Especially at the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) level, it is crucial to see as to why the execution of policy remains a dilemma. Whether these are internal capabilities of a firm like dependability, flexibility, and future technology improvement (Caldera et al. 2019) or the external factors like governmental laws and regulations that affect an SMEs’ sustainability (Kumar and Saravanan 2017; Yang and Ha-Brookshire 2019). It requires a comprehensive review of the sustainability research to explore factors that play an intermittent role between formulated policies and their implementation. This way may provide plausible solutions to tackle the intermittent factors which cause damages to sustainability policy (Fischer et al. 2020; Jang 2020).

Sustainability encompasses three dimensions. First, organizations need to become socially responsible, the second organization needs to be environmentally friendly, and third, the organizations should create wealth for the shareholder. In this context, CS practices can simultaneously create benefits for society and profit maximization for shareholders in an environmentally driven business situation (Al Am 2016; Vincenza Ciasullo and Troisi 2013). Furthermore, CS practices also better all stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, contractors, community members, positive impact on the environment, and shareholder value maximization (Miska et al. 2018). Hence these practices improve reputation, reliability, and good relationship with stakeholders (Vincenza Ciasullo and Troisi 2013; Moktadir et al. 2018).

There are a thousand of initiatives practiced by private organizations for societal and environmental improvement. International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) (n.d.-a, b), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are among those who provide generic guidelines and are recognized by the governments and implementing in their countries according to their need and priority (Klettner et al. 2014). Despite having extensive policy frameworks to ensure sustainable corporate practices, their implementation is grossly missing. According to crude estimates, a few percent of the businesses truly execute the CS policies. Many organizations do greenwashing by showing some charity and environmental driven steps (Ramus and Montiel 2005). It raises a serious question of whether the CS policies are overambitious or the organizations are reluctant to implement them (Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet 2010).

Janaina et al. (2020) argued that decision-makers must understand local management practices and concepts instead of imposing challenging requirements on local companies and society. The growing demand for eco-friendly products invites the textile companies to search for diverse environmental instruments to fulfill the demand of customers who look for a sustainable product. In this way, companies can sustainably gain a premium price to enhance profit in a promising way (Hayat et al. 2020).

There may be some other factors due to which the CS policies may not be translated into actions. The present study undertakes this task by comprehensively reviewing the literature on CS policies to draw the reasons for the literature’s lack of implementation. This study contributes to the much-needed debate of the gap between CS policies and their implementation. The study also contributes by providing the steps that can be instrumental in implementing CS policies. The subsequent section of the paper briefly entails the methodology adopted for the review.

# Material and method

The early research on sustainability started in the year 1950s (such as Bowen 1953). Therefore, we selected the studies published between the 1950 to 2020 period for this comprehensive review. We developed ten keywords to search the articles related to CS (see Table 1). The various combinations of these keywords were used to query the research articles from selected six databases (see Table 1). In the first search, 1224 papers were downloaded using the keywords or their combinations. After reading the titles, 845 research papers were retained as the rest of the papers were not directly linked with CS, CS policies and/or its implementation. In the second phase, abstracts of all 845 papers read and 107 articles were retained for the final review. The yearly detail of the article.

Governance appeared as a significant study area in all six publishers; education and SMEs appeared as the second most essential study areas, followed by innovation, urban studies, EU policies, research, and innovation financial and fiscal studies.

Before proceeding further, it is imperative to discuss the different terminologies, which addresses CS’s concept. Researchers use interchangeable terminologies, such as sustainability, corporate social responsibility, corporate citizenship, corporate philanthropy, corporate social performance, socially responsible behavior, corporate ethics, stakeholders management, corporate accountability to reflect the sustainability of a firm (Ahmed and Ahmed 2011; Barron 2010; Helleno et al. 2017; Miska et al. 2018; Pedersen 2006; Sheinbaum-Pardo et al. 2012). The stated terminologies represent the tri-dimensional concept of CS, including social, environmental, and economic dimensions. We use term CS in this paper to reflect the sustainability of a firm.

Inclusion criteria for this review studies are the social and environmental dimensions of CS carried out on policy and practice issues in SMEs, manufacturing, and services sectors.

We have divided the literature review section into five sub-sections. The “Introduction” section gives a brief profile of CS concept, the “Material and method” section addresses theoretical exposition, the “Literature review” section CS policy and practices, the “Results and discussion” section addresses different policy approaches, and finally, the “Concluding remarks” section addresses the factors affecting CS policy and practices.

# Literature review

# Profile of corporate sustainability

Over the last few decades, different researchers investigated the domain of social obligations of businesspersons. During the evolution of CS, Andrew Carnegie (1889), a businessperson/philanthropist, wrote an essay on the concept of social obligation, wherein he emphasized the wealthy class of society needs the philanthropic/well-being of the poor (laborers) who are trying to bring social change in their lives. People in business need to understand the difference between social responsibility and charity (Clark 1916); he further added that the problem is not helping society’s deprived class. However, it is the approach and perspective of businessmen who help the under privileged class with charity rather than business responsibility. Berle (1932), in his scholastic note, calls for the attention of the trust factor between business and societal well-being. Abrams (1951), Clark (1926), and Kreps (1940) also discussed the social obligation of businesspersons.

In subsequent decades, scholars further extended the research work of the social responsibility of business organizations. Howard Bowen is considered the father of CSR in the western world (Carroll 1999; Türkel and Akan 2015). In 1953, Howard Bowen argued for business organizations’ social obligation and explained that CS practices brought a competitive advantage for the organization.

Since the early years, the concept of CS remained a complex—known as social responsibility in the 1950s and 1960s. Davis (1960) explained that business leaders could deal with the social responsibility of the businesses in the next fifty years.

# Policy and practice of corporate sustainability

The popularity of CS influenced the policy and planning approaches (McLean and Borén 2015). Perrini and Minoja (2008) emphasized that corporate behavior towards sustainability has gained a central position among sustainability-conscious decision-makers. Policy formulation and implementation are two different domains (Galbreath 2009), and according to Kotler (2001), policy implementation is the process of translating the policy into actions to achieve the organizational objectives. Therefore, despite focusing on sustainability policy and planning, failures in the implementation phase occur up to some extent; one reason for the failure of sustainability policy is the gap between policy and its implementation. In view, Ménard et al. (2018) argued that policies are written documents, and, without clear understanding, interpretation, and communication cannot be implemented in the contexts.

It is rare in literature how to make a policy coherent with all three dimensions of CS (Klettner et al. 2014); thus, when management device policies and when it implements, most of the time it lacks (Spiller and Savedoff 1999). One core gap, which causes flaws, is the lack of leadership commitment and the clarification/understanding of policy. Ménard et al. (2018) argued that meso-institutions are responsible for the implementation and operationalization of policies; if not adequately addressed the policy, then they mislead and end up with gaps between policy and practice.

There are several contributing factors to the success or failure of policies. Roosa (2007) argued that sustainability policy’s objectives and goals could not be achieved without the contribution and successful nexus of stakeholders (citizens) and the policymaking authorities.

Jiménez and Pérez-Foguet (2010) argued that gaps between policies and practices occur particularly in developing countries due to unrealistic thinking, overambitious policies, objectives that are distant from reality, local culture, norms and values of society. Unrealistic policies end-up with gaps when these policies come to the level of implementation. Ménard et al. (2018) also argued that some part of the gap arises due to poor performance of meso-institutions.

Bonn and Fisher (2011) explained that CS is the missing part of the policy, and it must be incorporated in the organizations’ strategic decisions. Corporate policy and CS policy of the organization in the form of a single organizational strategy can address problems of environmental and social dimensions along with profit maximization (Engert et al. 2016). Baumgartner (2014) said that making a CS policy is not the only important factor, but how to implement the same is even more essential.

Despite the popularity of CS and its priority in the western world, one single generic policy encompassing CS and organizational strategy may not be equally adaptable for all.

organizations due to the specific needs and demands of differ-

ent stakeholders. Hence, the companies’ management has to

put their efforts and look into their particular needs while

formulating the policies (Bos Brouwers 2010; Gouldson and

Sullivan 2007; Springett 2003). One more area which needs

attention is that when policymakers need to choose one among

environment and economic dimension; policymakers always

supersede the economic dimension over the environmental

dimension. Paulraj (2009) argued that commitment to the pol-

icy and implementation of the policy are two different and

independent factors, and companies opt the minimum of legal

compliances and try to resolve the environmental issues.

However, from the perspective of developing countries, it

varies from country to country according to their needs and

demands (Abreu 2009).

With the passage of time, most companies have started

adopting the CS, instead of avoiding it as the management

of the companies has realized that by adopting CS, efficiency

and productivity of the company may be increased (Jnr et al.

2019). However, to become a responsible organization in the

business community, it requires planning in the realm of

policymaking and implementation, which may not only take

the organization beyond the profitmaking and legal compli-

ance but also provides the opportunity to work for the mitiga-

tion of risk aversion and bridging gaps between business and

society (Morgan et al. 2009). Furthermore, CS addresses the

issues of well-being and environmental degradation. It also

guides management to resolve the core problems related to

their products (Werther and Chandler 2010).

# Corporate sustainability policy approaches

There are several underlying approaches to develop a policy

for CS. Researchers contributed different ideas in this realm;

all have their rationale and significance. Scholars have

discussed different approaches (Klettner et al. 2014).

Pedersen (2006) stressed that in social responsibility, the par-

ticipatory approach has five elements to understand the dia-

logue between social responsibility and stakeholders; it

includes inclusion, openness, tolerance, empowerment, and

transparency.

Davies (2009) suggested the idea of a Grassroots approach

through environmental education on grassroots and

community-based interventions. The Environmental Impact

Assessment Approach is another avenue for policy planning,

which integrates policy appraisal and supports sustainable de-

velopment more than the sectoral appraisal system. This ap-

proach provides rational and quality information for decision-

making. Integrated Sustainability Assessment approach for

sustainable development policymaking is participatory and

based on a participatory cyclic process of scoping,

envisioning, experimenting, and learning through the shared

interpretation of sustainability; it helps to develop and apply in

an integrated manner in the context (Whitmarsh et al. 2009).

Evidence-based policymaking is another approach, but as

the perspective of business sectors and its context complicates

the application of this approach (Jasanoff 2009; Radaelli

1995; Nutley et al. 2007). The practice approach is another

idea for the CS policy and strategy; it recommends that the

attention of companies is to be on the practice (Guohui and

Eppler 2008). A systematic approach is also an integral ap-

proach; its impact is widespread in all sectors, especially in the

construction industry (Davies 2009). The systematic approach

is the holistic idea in such a sector because today’s decision

must have room for alteration for future generations (Hendriks

2004). Fischer (2000) argued that the systematic approach

advocates for participatory decision-making instead of solo

decisions. This approach suggests taking the input of stake-

holders for better decisions; by doing so, stakeholder’s per-

spective adds insight wisdom to the process from the end-user

point of view; by this approach, policy and planning can

become comprehensive.

The economic instrument policy approach is also

supporting in controlling environmental pollution. Bailey

(1999) and Kennedy (1996) argued that business organization

internalizes the cost of pollution that they create in this ap-

proach. Clarke and Roome (1999) emphasize the role of in-

termediaries in the adaption of environmental practices. In

order to know the feasible option for SMEs, the

intermediaries/consultants can provide access to readily avail-

able expert knowledge to SMEs and can contribute and in-

crease their absorptive capacity.

Achieving, sustainability goal in all sectors of human

endeavor; requires a quality decision process for policy

management, which includes significant ongoing informa-

tion gathering, processing, and disseminating efforts

(Clark 2009). There are five different types of sustainabil-

ity impacts identified on governance modes: (i) centralized

governance, (ii) decentralized governance, (iii) public-

private partnership, (iv) interactive governance, (v) self-

regulation (Driessen et al. 2012; Lange et al. 2019).

They explained the earlier two are traditional command-

and-control approaches of policy. Driessen et al. (2012)

further explained that, in the centralized-mode of policy,

the central government’s role is crucial, and the

decentralized-mode of policy is cantonal. They further ex-

plained in the public-private partnership mode of policy

that the role of the public sector organization is to interact

with privates’ associations for policymaking. The fourth

mode of governance is the collaborative governance

among the public sector, private sector, and civil society

on an equal basis. The final mode of governance is self-

regulation. Deakin and Hobbs (2007) argue that self-

regulation model is an opportunity for a business organi-

zation to embed in society.

# Factors affecting corporate sustainability policy and practices

In the literature review, multiple factors were identified which affected policymaking and implementation of technological change and influence societal practices (Bachus and Vanswijgenhoven 2018). Fairbrass (2011) mentioned that government/public authorities need policy debate with interested parties comprised of different stakeholders in policymaking.

# Role of government/public sector institutions

Keeping in view the critique of Friedman (1962), the social dimension is not the responsibility of the business organization; however, governments through legislation may control the business organizations to comply with a social dimension. The report of Brundtland et al. (1987) also identified that government should control the careless use of natural resources, which creates an adverse effect on the environment. In this context, the role of the governments is essential for the implementation and monitoring of CS. In recent years to become competitive in the international market, the Chinese regulatory authorities have forced Chinese companies to adopt CS (Zhu 2016).

Among the emerging economies the manufacturing sector is highly energy intensive sector. Thus, it is essential to look into the CS issues (Yu et al. 2017). The industrial growth in China has produced a huge volume of Carbon Dioxide and is considered the most resource-consuming and polluting country. China can bring immense improvement in global environmental issues (Feng et al. 2018).

Busch and Hoffmann (2009) and Luan et al. (2013) emphasized that government plays an instrumental role in putting the firms on track for eco-friendly attitude. Ecoprofit, an Austrian-based initiative, helps SMEs in reducing the environmental impact of SMEs. The company has implemented number of energy conservation projects with the help of local government (Beise and Rennings 2005; Rennings et al. 2006; van Hemel and Cramer 2002). Likewise, in Manali, an Indian tourism destination, stakeholders’ efforts failed to achieve their environmental objectives due to the local government’s lack of interest. Gardner and Sinclair (2003) explained that the role of the state was crucial in eradicating the pollution problems. In another example of government intervention to improve the environmental conditions, Xanthos and Walker (2017) described that pollution problems had compelled the governments to devise laws/policies to overcome the pollution problems.

The role of local government was also crucial in the implementation of policies (Sinclair and Fenton 1997) comparing the Canadian National Packaging Protocol and the European Parliament Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive. They identified that the EU and Canada policies were weak as there was a lack of obligation at the province level in Canada and member states level in the EU. Another view of policymaking is environmental taxation, which can bring desirable change in the right direction. This approach can contribute in long terms.

# Organizational barriers

For better implementation of CS policies, researchers identified multiple factors. A study of CS in the Chinese manufacturing industry (Orji 2019) identified twelve barriers, wherein eleven are organizational barriers. These barriers include inefficient, poor, and inadequate plans, poor waste management, low suppliers selection, lack of finances, inferior technology, lack of top management commitment, communication gap, lack of training, lack of awareness among stakeholders, insufficient environmental compliances, and absence of good employee welfare plans. Several other researchers also identified these organizational barriers in their studies (Klewitz et al. 2012; Nykvist and Nilsson 2009; Moore 2005; Orji 2019; Trianni et al. 2017).

Engert et al. (2016) argue that companies must take the initiative to incorporate CS in their policies. Managers must create a learning environment or learning organization where employees interact with CS’s environmental and social dimensions. Nykvist and Nilsson (2009) mentioned that an organizational barrier includes lack of adequate time, expertise, resources, and availability of sufficient data for decision-making; and some structural barriers, which include the behavior of the policymaker, and the business sector is also one factor that affects the policy implementation process. Policy management has two essential factors, first is policy formulation, and the second is its implementation (Mintzberg and Waters 1985). Companies have developed sufficient skills in devising the policies; whereas the implementation of the policy still lacks (Zahn 1979), which causes the gap between the policy and its implementation.

# Self-regulation/subsidiarity/reflexive laws

The subsidiarity approach in environmental issues advocates for addressing and resolving the environmental problems at the local level within the member states of the EU, preferably with the participation of local authorities and citizens (Collier 1997). CS practice is an opportunity for business organizations, through which businesses can embed themselves in society by addressing social needs. This opportunity is not stringent, and it is based on reflexive law/self-regulation (Deakin and Hobbs 2007). In reality, CS practices are still not adopted in business processes. Once, If the CS issues are understood, businesses can avert risk and meet competitiveness (Deakin and Hobbs 2007; Driessen et al. 2012; Lange et al. 2019).

# Role of stakeholders

Stakeholders are the most influential actors in policy planning and implementation (Masurel 2007). Mathis (2007) examined the CS policy implementation in the dairy sector of the Netherland. He drew three inferences from the result of the study. First, he identified that a higher level of stakeholder management with the help of CS engagement allows business organizations to create a closer link with public authorities. Second, he identified that stakeholders influence the policymaking process. Third, the proactive approach towards CS policy in the private sector leads to self-regulation.

# Normative references

Kehbila et al. (2010) examined the state of environmental policy implementation in the South African Automotive Industry. Their study revealed that the South African Government was concerned for the country’s environmental condition, due to loss of biodiversity, land, disposal of waste, deterioration of air quality, noise pollution, and degradation of the marine environment. Kehbila et al. (2010) reported that large and SME sizes of automobile companies are operating in South Africa, and all are committed to maintaining the sustainability matters of automobile sectors. Results revealed that companies have ISO 14001 certification, ISO 9001 quality audit (external and internal), which includes SMEs. Dankova et al. (2015) explained three levels and types of standards being initiated/practices internationally, i.e., (i) sustainability standard based on political wills, such as UNGS, OECD ME, OECD CG, and GSC, (ii) CS standard based on professional judgment, such as SA8000 and ISO 26000, and (iii) CS reporting standards, such as GRI and EFFAS KPIs.

In underdeveloped countries, lack of learning environment in organizational poor technologies, lack of management CS stimulate exponential positive employee behavior, workers behavior, information, commitment, institutional rules, accurate accounting with effective monitoring and regulatory support, and management on the environment and maximize the identified external and internal barriers. Government encompassing meaningful enforcement of CS laws through state arrangements are cosmetic (fudge). We ultimately need a framework from long-term technological change.

policymaking process. The more engage the stakeholders, and the more will influence the dialogue creates influences sustainability. Internal and external stakeholder pressure shape the policymaking process. In this study, organizational barriers identified include rigid disciplinary (lack of room for initiative), lack of evaluation systems, and the participation of public sector institutions in organization follow its CS policy published on its websites. It identified that the services cost of the pollution they produce, and it is an essential support for successful CS policy. The focus remained on minimizing policy where the organizations internalize the effective implementation of CS policy.

Third, a proactive approach to the CSR policy in the private sector is less likely to implement the environmental policies. This study emphasized the role of SME can obtain their services and can help in CS knowledge. The identified factors affecting the policy include unclear priorities.

# Results and discussion

The study intended to explore the relevant literature for understanding the corporate sustainability policymaking and implementation, different policy approaches, and the most important to identify the factors which affect the outcome of the CS policy and its implementation (see Table 6).

Through the literature review, it is learned that the pressing demand for corporate sustainability invites the academicians, researchers, and practitioners to practice the sustainability dimensions for a prosperous future and sustainable development. Thus, it is emphasized that practitioners should devise the CS policy and corporate policy as a single/combined policy.

After a thorough review of relevant articles, a total of five significant factors were identified which could influence the policymaking process (see Table 5). In these five factors, most of the scholars debated on the role of government/public sector institutions and stakeholders. Apart from these two, the organizational barriers have also appeared from the articles’ review as a significant factor (see Table 7). The elements in the organizational barrier need a focus to address the CS issues for better results.

Based on the literature reviewed, barriers and enablers are identified, which has further two types each, following is the detail of barriers and enablers.

Self-regulations/subsidiarity and normative references are also important factors identified. The importance of normative references cannot be overlooked for the organizations’ better quality products and services.

The facts which have come to the foreground after a thorough review show that at a different level of the public sector (macro and meso-institution), different stakeholder and different business models need to adopt an adequate policymaking approach among identified different policy approaches (see Table 4) for their success to achieve sustainable development for the better future of organizations.

# Concluding remarks

Fahey and Pralle (2016) argued that environmental policy research lacks in underdeveloped countries, and they call for more research in less wealthy countries around the world. Armstrong and Kamieniecki (2019) shed light on the importance of common sustainability challenges such as climate change. They emphasized the public sector pursuing sustainability problems in isolation and need to collaborate with the stakeholders for shared understanding and better policymaking.

With the overview of the literature, it is learned that policymakers of the organizations also need to strategize the

essential part of policy formulation. Once the stated factors and elements discussed above are considered in the entire process of policymaking, it will adequately address policy and practice gaps. Furthermore, it is also learned that, in many cases, states and governments’ intervention becomes imperative to make the policies successful and achieve desired results.

In the context of policymaking, it is identified that SMEs by their structure has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantages include informal ways of communications, less bureaucratic environment, speedy decision-making, direct interaction with customers and clients, and lean organizational structure. Simultaneously, disadvantages include lack of finances, lack of knowledge, and lack of expert human resource for sustainability issues. The disadvantages are like barriers and posing challenges for integrating the SME’s business activities with sustainability (Klewitz et al. 2012).

It is evident in the literature that the organization implements the environmental policy because of the reasons such as government laws and regulation, stakeholder’s pressure, competitor’s pressure, economic advantages (Bansal and Roth 2000; Mubarik 2015; Khan et al. 2020; Mubarik and Naghavi 2020; Alam et al. 2020; Islam et al. 2019). Another view to bridge the gaps between the policy and implementation needs a thorough translation of the policy into action plans, such as setting the objective, preparing the guidelines, and action plans (Epstein and Roy 2007) (see Figs. 2 and 3).

# Limitation

Since the CS is a broad concept, so as its policy and practice too. Thus, it is a challenging task to explore the entire body of knowledge. Hence, this review paper is limited to six (see Table 2) leading publishers with 10 keywords; more specifically, only CS policy and practice related significant paper were chosen for review.

# Implications

# Theoretical implication

In this review paper, stakeholder theory appeared as the most cited theory and institutional theory is the second most cited theory. It has come the foreground that institutional theory is embedded in the stakeholder theory or we can say that stakeholder theory encapsulate the isomorphic and defusion elements of institutional theory. This encapsulation will implicate the future research to expand and explore the further depth of stakeholder theory.

In this review paper specific factors and subfactors explored (see Fig. 3 and Table 7) which has impact on CS policy practices. These factors and subfactors will serve as base work for future quantitative research studies.

Furthermore, schematic snapshot developed on the basis of this review paper (see Fig. 2) depicts that how the global sustainability initiative creates trickle down impact from United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) and penetrates in signatory countries macro and meso level policymaking institutions and subsequently encourages the companies operating in respective countries for practices of social and environmental dimensions. When the firms start practicing social and environmental initiatives, then the role of different management theories emerges according to the pressure of different stakeholders operating in the internal and external environment the companies.

The triple bottom line framework is operating in the management system, yet the volume of practices of social and environmental dimensions on the company basis, and in return its impact on society and environment is still vague. Researchers need to further investigate to devise methods so that utilization of financial capital and HR capital for CS practices may be quantitatively compared with the policy outcome of a company.

Keeping in view the essence of co-evolutionary theory, in this review paper, it has emerged that lack of knowledge of CS and policy making among stakeholders is hindering in obtaining the maximum advantage of limited resources and strengths of stakeholders. This essential implication of this review paper invites the policymakers to address it.

# Practical implication

This review paper will contribute as an authentic snapshot for future practitioners from two perspectives. First perspective is the eight different policy approaches being adopted by the policy makers (see Table 4). Each policy approach has its own significance and varies from sector to sector and business to business, and practitioners can formulate their organizational policy in the light of stated approaches. Second perspective is the factors affecting CS policy and practices (see Tables 5 and 6); the implications of these factors can contribute as a guidance tool in the process of policy making to avoid intermittent which causes the gaps in CS policy and practice.

# Recommendations

For future research, it is recommended to investigate the magnitude of factors and subfactors of CS Practices (see Fig. 3). It is also recommended to investigate the magnitude and direction of factors in Table 7 on CS practices. Furthermore, it is recommended to understand the effectivity of co-evolutionary theory in collaboration with the stakeholder theory.

# Abstract

Review of extant research on the corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) link generally demonstrates a positive relationship. However, some arguments and empirical results have demonstrated otherwise. As a result, researchers have called for a contingency approach to this research stream, which moves beyond the basic question ‘‘does it pay to be green?’’ and instead asks ‘‘when does it pay to be green?’’ In answering this call, we provide a meta-analytic review of CEP–CFP literature in which we identify potential moderators to the CEP–CFP relationship including environmental performance type (e.g., reactive vs. proactive performance), firm characteristics (e.g., large vs. small firms), and methodological issues (e.g., self-report measures). By analyzing these contingencies, this study attempts to provide a basis on which to draw conclusions regarding some inconsistencies and debates in the CEP–CFP research. Some of the results of the moderator analysis suggest that small firms benefit from environmental performance as much or more than large firms, US firms seem to benefit more than international counterparts, and environmental performance seems to have the strongest influence on market-measures of financial performance.

# Introduction

A large body of research has sought to answer the question, “Does it pay to be green?” (see Ambec and Lanoie 2008, for a review). This focus on firm environmental performance leading to financial benefits for the organization continues to be explored in both the academic literature (e.g., Baker and Sinkula 2005; Christmann 2000; Clarkson et al. 2008; Coombs and Gilley 2005) and the business press (e.g., Engardio et al. 2007; Spaeder 2006; Tozzi 2008). Although results have been mixed, the majority of the research, including meta-analytic results (Orlitzky et al. 2003), suggest that indeed a positive relationship does exist between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP).

While establishing a link between CEP and CFP provides an important contribution, the specific boundary...

# Corporate Environmental and Financial Performance

Conditions surrounding the relationship remain unclear. As a result, interest is growing in identifying relevant variables that may moderate the CEP–CFP relationship (Russo and Fouts 1997). A poll of scholars in the Organizations and the Natural Environmental division of the Academy of Management stressed the need for, “increasingly sophisticated research to examine the link between environmental strategy and competitive advantage” (Sharma and Starik 2002, p. 11). Moreover, a number of scholars have emphasized the need for adopting a contingency perspective in the treatment of CEP–CFP research (e.g., Sharma and Starik 2002; Wagner 2007; Christmann 2000). In response, a few studies have found promise in attempting to address these issues (e.g., Christmann 2000; Klassen and Whybark 1999). The results of these studies highlight the need to better understand competitive advantage resulting from CEP. Thus, we must move beyond simply asking “Does it pay to be green?” to “When does it pay to be green?” (Sharma and Starik 2002).

Unfortunately, answering these questions has presented a challenge for a number of reasons. First, the research examining the CEP–CFP link spans academic disciplines (i.e., management, finance, economics, accounting, marketing) and theoretical lenses making synthesis and interpretation difficult (Klassen and Whybark 1999). Second, there has been a lack of consensus and norms in empirical studies regarding the selection of the appropriate environmental performance, financial performance, and control variables necessary to examine these relationships (Wagner 2007). These differences in methodologies have often been blamed for the inconsistencies in findings in the CEP–CFP literature (Griffin and Mahon 1997; Russo and Fouts 1997; Ullman 1985). As a result of these issues, the practical implications of this research stream remain limited (Klassen and Whybark 1999) leaving managers with limited guidance in their efforts to improve CEP.

Although research on organizations and the natural environment, including the CEP–CFP link, has been the subject of narrative and meta-analytic reviews in the management literature (Ambec and Lanoie 2008; Etzion 2007; Orlitzky et al. 2003, Sharma and Starik 2002), to date, there has not been a meta-analytical empirical synthesis which goes beyond the basic question “Does it pay to be green?” In an effort to advance CEP–CFP research, we focus on systematically answering the question, “When does it pay to be green?” to provide important and necessary clarifications for both research and practice. To do so, we provide a meta-analytic review of CEP–CFP literature in which we identify potential moderators to the CEP–CFP link including environmental performance type (reactive vs. proactive), firm characteristics (e.g., large vs. small firm, public vs. private firm, US-based firms vs. international firms, and worst offenders vs. a broader representation of firms), and methodological issues (financial performance measures, emissions measures, self-report measures). By analyzing these contingencies, this study attempts to provide a basis on which to draw conclusions regarding some inconsistencies and debates in the CEP–CFP research.

We begin by discussing the background of the general CEF–CFP relationship. Next, we examine the arguments for the contingencies we identify including types of environmental performance, firm-level characteristics, and methodological inconsistencies. We then describe our meta-analytic procedures and outcomes. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of our results, implications, and possible directions for future research.

The research on the relationship between corporate environmental and financial performance has been the focus of several literature reviews (see Ambec and Lanoie 2008; Etzion 2007; Sharma and Starik 2002, for examples). The majority of the existing studies support a generally positive relationship between CEP and CFP (e.g., Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Nehrt 1996; Russo and Fouts 1997; Spicer 1978). The primary arguments in this line of research are that positive environmental performance represents a focus on innovation and operational efficiency (e.g., Porter and van der Linde 1995), reflects strong organizational and management capabilities (e.g., Aragon-Correa 1998), enhances firm legitimacy (e.g., Hart 1995), and allows a firm to meet the needs of diverse stakeholders (e.g., Freeman and Evan 1990).

First, environmental performance is viewed as a proxy for operational efficiency (e.g., Porter and van der Linde 1995; Starik and Marcus 2000). The eco-efficiency argument is based on the notion that pollution is a waste of resources and represents unnecessary costs for the firm (Porter and van der Linde 1995). Improved efficiency via environmental performance lowers costs and increases innovation leading to competitive advantage (Aragon-Correa 1998; Christmann 2000; Judge and Douglas 1998; Klassen and Whybark 1999; Russo and Fouts 1997; Shrivastava 1995). Second, strong environmental performance might be viewed as a measure of organizational and managerial capabilities including a long-term versus short-term perspective, a focus on continuous innovation and reduced organizational risk (Aragon-Correa 1998; Hart 1995; Sharma 2000; Russo and Fouts 1997; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998; Shrivastava 1995). Third, firms with strong environmental performance might reap reputational benefits, which result in social legitimacy (Hart 1995), the ability to attract and retain quality employees (Turban and Greening 1997), and

increased sales (Russo and Fouts 1997). Finally, instrumental stakeholder theory posits that to be successful, firms must meet the needs of diverse stakeholder groups, including environmental, employee, and societal groups (Freeman and Evan 1990; Marcus and Geffen 1998; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998).

Although most CEP–CFP studies suggest a positive relationship, there are some conceptual arguments and empirical studies which support a negative relationship or suggest no significant relationship (e.g., Fogler and Nutt 1975; Freedman and Jaggi 1986). The traditional economic trade-off argument posits that firms incur large costs to improve environmental performance and that these costs exceed the financial benefits gained from them (e.g., Friedman 1970; Greer and Bruno 1996; Jaffe et al. 1995; Walley and Whitehead 1994). Moreover, by improving environmental performance a firm is simply transferring societal costs to the firm (e.g., Bragdon and Marlin 1972). Thus, this approach suggests that pursuing environmental initiatives may be both unprofitable and inappropriate for organizations.

In an effort to address this ongoing debate, Orlitzky et al. (2003) meta-analyzed CEP–CFP empirical studies, through 1997, as part of a larger study on corporate social performance. The results of their analysis demonstrate a positive relationship between CEP and CFP, and conclude that, in fact, it does pay to be green. While these results have provided some closure to the debate surrounding the general CEP–CFP relationship, work in this area has continued. In fact, there have been a number of studies which examine the CEP–CFP relationship since Orlitzky’s meta-analysis. Therefore, in an effort to move forward, we extend their analysis here, while expecting similar results in our baseline analysis. We also argue, however, that it is time to move on from this general question to address remaining unanswered questions surrounding the CEP–CFP relationship. We agree with other researchers who have emphasized that, unlike other dimensions of CSP, environmental initiatives may not lead to a cost advantage for all firms under all conditions (Christmann 2000; Russo and Fouts 1997). In answering the call for a contingency perspective on CEP–CFP research, our contribution lies in extending our meta-analysis of CEP–CFP empirical studies to a more fine-grained examination of firm-and industry-level characteristics, types of environmental performance, and methodological issues. In doing so, we hope to provide more clarity and guidance for research and practice, on when it pays to be green.

# Reactive Versus Proactive Environmental Strategies

Typologies of environmental strategies and performance abound. Roome (1992) suggests a five-step progression from “noncompliance” to “leading edge.” Hunt and Auster (1990) also posit five types of environmental approaches ranging from “beginner” to “proactivist.” In the larger domain of corporate social responsibility literature, typologies include reactive, defensive, accommodative, and proactive approaches (Carroll 1979; Clarkson 1995; Wartick and Cochran 1985). Generally found within each of these typologies is a dichotomy which has been termed compliance versus proactive (Buysse and Verbeke 2003; Russo and Fouts 1997), traditional versus modern approaches (Aragon-Correa 1998), conformance versus voluntariness (Sharma 2000), or reactive versus proactive (Henriques and Sadorsky 1999).

For the purposes of this study, we will use the terms reactive and proactive to represent these two forms of environmental strategies. Reactive strategies are driven by compliance and aims to meet legal requirements (Buysse and Verbeke 2003; Sharma 2000) which usually require the use of traditional end-of-pipe methods (Bucholz 1993) such as trapping, storing, or treating emissions (Hart 1995). Reactive environmental approaches generally, although not always, lack significant involvement from top management, do not include employee environmental training and involvement (Henriques and Sadorsky 1999), and as the title would indicate, only “react” to solve problems when they arise (Aragon-Correa 1998).

By contrast, a proactive environmental approach incorporates environmental issues into corporate business strategy beyond the requirements of government regulation (Buysse and Verbeke 2003) and is focused on preventing problems by dealing with the source (Aragon-Correa 1998). Thus, proactive approaches may involve better “housekeeping”, material substitution, process innovation, redesign of production and service delivery processes, creative problem solving, the adoption of innovative technologies, or collaboration with stakeholders (Hart 1995; Russo and Fouts 1997; Sharma 2000). Firms that utilize proactive strategies view environmental management as important for business, encourage employee involvement, and receive significant support from top management (Henriques and Sadorsky 1999). Beyond the benefits to the natural environment, proactive environmental strategies may also benefit the firm through decreased costs for raw materials due to better utilization of inputs, simplification and removal of unnecessary steps in production leading to decreased cycle times (Hart 1995) and the development of valuable organization capabilities such as stakeholder integration, higher-order learning, and continuous innovation (Sharma and Vredenburg 1998). It is also possible, and likely, that some firms also pursue proactive and reactive strategies simultaneously.

Most researchers would conclude that proactive strategies should lead to greater reduction of environmental impact than reactive approaches. However, the question of

The interest for this study involves the influence of proactive versus reactive environmental strategies on CFP. Thus, the question can be stated, “does the additional investment in proactive environmental practices (e.g., process innovation) positively influence the financial bottom line to a greater extent than reliance on traditional, reactive, end-of-pipe solutions or when both strategies coexist?” In other words, “when does it pay to be green?” Through meta-analytical techniques, we compare the results of studies using reactive environmental strategy measures (e.g., pollution control) to studies using proactive environmental strategy measures (e.g., process redesign), as well as studies using measures reflecting both, in regards to their influence on CFP.

# Firm Characteristics

# Large Versus Small Firms

A significant number of management studies use samples consisting of large firms, often from the Fortune 500, which may limit the generalizability of findings. Researchers have pointed out strategic differences between large and small firms raising the question of whether small firms stand to benefit more or less than large firms from corporate environmental performance (e.g., Clemons 2006; Dean et al. 1998; Okada and Sawai 1999). On one hand, large firms may have more resources than small firms allowing for advantages associated with scale and greater investment in R&D and new technologies (D’Amboise and Muldowney 1988; Eden et al. 1997; Woo and Cooper 1981) while small firms may not have the slack resources to address environmental performance (Welsh and White 1981). On the other hand, it is possible that small firms are not burdened by the inertia of their larger counterparts and are more flexible, making them better able to respond to environmental challenges and organizational change (e.g., Chen and Hambrick 1995; Fiegenbaum and Karnani 1991; Storey 1994; Yu 2001).

Thus, arguments have been made that large firms should benefit more than small or private firms from environmental performance, as well as vice versa, resulting in a lack of guidance for future research and organizations alike. In meta-analyzing the moderating effect of firm size in the CEP–CFP relationship, our objective is to answer the question of whether the benefits of environmental performance are the same or different for large versus small firms.

# Public Versus Private Firms

In addition to size, organizational form may influence the CEP–CFP relationship. Public firms, whose shares are traded on a stock exchange, often receive higher levels of media attention and public interest making them better able to capitalize on reputational benefits achieved through environmental performance, whereas privately owned firms may have difficulty differentiating themselves via environmental performance if publicity surrounding the organization is low. At the same time, private firms receiving less attention from the press, the public, and environmental stakeholders may differ from public firms because they are able to use more discretion in the types of environmental initiatives they choose to implement, while public firms may feel pressured to adopt a wide range of environmental initiatives regardless of potential profitability (Dean et al. 1998).

Therefore, arguments can be made for benefits of both public and private firms. As such, it is important to meta-analyze the moderating effect of corporate form to shed light on the nature of this relationship. In doing so, we will enhance our understanding of whether performance benefits from CEP are the same or different for public versus private firms.

# US Versus International Firms

Recently, researchers have begun to look beyond US firms to examine the CEP–CFP link in firms based in other countries (e.g., Bansel 2005; Judge and Elenkov 2005; Menguc and Ozanne 2005), however, the majority of CEP–CFP research uses samples consisting of US-based corporations (i.e., Fortune 500). A firm’s ability to capitalize on environmental performance may be influenced by differences in economic, social, legal, and political environments. Economic disparity may lead to differences in resource scarcity which may affect environmental attitudes and practices (Zhu et al. 2007). In certain national contexts, the relationship between CEP and CFP may be influenced by social norms, public pressure, and expectations regarding environmental practices (Pasquero 1991; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998). In addition to attitudinal differences, variation in environmental regulations and enforcement may also influence the CEP–CFP link (Christmann 2000) with firms in countries with stricter regulations regarding environmental issues facing stronger threats to organizational legitimacy (Zhu et al. 2007). The use of US firms in much of the CEP–CFP literature raises questions as to the generalizability to other national settings where environmental regulation and laws differ. Interestingly, although much of the CEP–CFP research uses samples consisting of US corporations, the United States is one of the few industrialized nations not to have signed the Kyoto Protocol, the highly publicized global environmental initiative, leading to further issues of the relevance of broadly applying US-based studies. In today’s global business

environment, the lines between domestic and international firms are blurred with the majority of companies having some degree of internationalization (e.g., importing/exporting supplies, products, subsidiary in other country, etc.). We focus here, however, only on the location of the firm’s headquarters. For example, Ford Motor Company, imports, exports, and has facilities in countries other than the US. However, Ford is still typically perceived as a US firm. Whereas, Toyota is not typically perceived as an American firm although the company has manufacturing plants and sells products in the US. Here, we attempt to answer the question, “Does CEP matter more or less for firms who are based in the U.S. than for internationally based counterparts?” In doing so, we hope to shed light on whether findings regarding the CEP–CFP link are generalizable to firms in other national contexts.

# Industry—Worst Offenders Versus Others

Regulatory differences for firms in certain industries may also influence the relationship between CEP and CFP. Specifically, it is possible that the “worst offenders,” firms in industries with negative reputations regarding environmental performance, may experience greater media attention and more pressure from NGOs, consumers, and governmental authorities, resulting in the potential for greater gains in organizational legitimacy through better environmental performance (Bansel 2005; Berrone and Gomez-Mejia 2009; Hoffman 2001). Moreover, executives in such high polluting industries, for example, may have less influence over the environmental performance given the nature of the business (Berrone and Gomez-Mejia 2009). A number of existing CEP–CFP studies have focused on the “worst offenders,” particularly high polluting industries (i.e., oil and gas, heavy manufacturing, EPA lists, etc.) (e.g., Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Christmann 2000; Clarkson et al. 2008; Freedman and Jaggi 1986). In addition to the contextual industry-level differences (i.e., regulatory and social pressure), the use of the “worst offenders” in longitudinal studies may also create issues with regression toward the mean making interpretation of results complicated (Trochim 2001). As such, researchers have emphasized the need for future studies to replicate CEP–CFP studies in other types of industries where the results of environmental performance may differ (Sharma and Vredenburg 1998). Through meta-analytical techniques, we compare the results of studies using samples of firms from industries often considered to be the “worst offenders” and studies with samples representing firms from a broad set of industries to see if environmental performance matters more for firms in high polluting industries, than for firms in other industries.

# Methodological Issues

# Financial Performance Measure

The research methodology of the CEP–CFP literature has been the subject of past criticism. One methodological issue that is commonly raised is the lack of consistency in operationalizing the independent (i.e., environmental performance) and the dependent (i.e., financial performance) variables. The lack of uniformity in measures has been thought to be a reason for some of the inconsistent findings in the literature (Greiffen and Mahon 1997; Ullman 1985). For example, while competitive advantage resulting from reputational benefits of positive environmental performance, reduced risk perceptions, and meeting the needs of stakeholders may be reflected in market-based measures, accounting measures may be better indicators of efficiency and organizational capabilities (Orlitzky et al. 2003). Additionally, some financial performance measures may represent short-term performance gains (e.g., stock-price), whereas others may represent more long-term financial viability (e.g., ROE). Thus, we may expect different outcomes based on the choice of the financial performance variable (i.e., ROA, stock-price, sales growth, market share, etc.). A second methodological issue is that past research has not consistently considered the potential for a lag between a firm’s environmental performance and subsequent financial performance results raising issues of causality. Therefore, we compare studies which measure environmental and financial performance simultaneously to those studies in which the dependent variable, financial performance, is lagged for 1-year or more. A better understanding of if and how CEP affects different measures of financial performance will assist managers in their decision-making regarding environmental initiatives. We provide an analysis of these potential differences.

# Environmental Performance Measure

Environmental performance has also been measured using a variety of objective and non-objective measures using data such as independent databases (e.g., KLD; Turban and Greening 1997), self-report surveys from managers (e.g., Judge and Douglas 1998), and pollution indicators (e.g., TRI: Clarkson et al. 2008). The toxic release inventory (TRI), the US Environmental Protection Agency’s data measuring toxic chemical releases and waste management activities (EPA 2008), is a commonly used proxy for evaluating environmental performance in CEP–CFP studies. As some researchers have pointed out, however, that the TRI data is primarily a measure of chemical emissions, not a comprehensive indicator of a firm’s total environmental performance (e.g., Ambec and Lanoie 2008; Sharma and Starik).

2002). Thus, the conclusions drawn from the results of such studies may or may not be capturing the true picture of the environmental performance–financial performance link. In this meta-analysis, we hope to clarify the issue of whether the use of different measures of environmental performance (i.e., TRI vs. others) has a substantive effect on the CEP–CFP relationship. This clarification should shed light on the importance of environmental performance operationalizations, in turn guiding future research. Additionally, it will help inform managers as to whether it is pollution reduction alone or other environmental performance indicators that matter to the firm’s bottom line.

# Self-Report Measures

Another measurement concern that has been raised in this body of work is the issue of the potential inherent bias in the practice of surveying managers who provide self-reported measures of their firm’s environmental performance (Sharma 2001). For example, managers may perceive that their firms are really greener than they actually are. The question of the objectivity of self-report questionnaires is not unique to the corporate environmental performance literature, but has been debated by academicians for a number of years. Some researchers argue that self-reports create major threats to validity (e.g., social desirability, selective memory, etc.) making them a fallible source of data (e.g., Schwarz 1999). In contrast, others argue that while all methodologies have weaknesses, the variance resulting from the use of survey methodology is minimal and not problematic if researchers give proper consideration to addressing potential validity threats (e.g., Howard 1994; Schmitt 1994). Moreover, they claim that self-reports may actually provide advantages over other methods because they are a useful tool for accessing perceptions (Spector 1994) and are easy to administer (Howard 1994). We systematically examine the CEP–CFP literature to determine whether the use of self-report measures of environmental performance results in different outcomes than the use of archival data (e.g., KLD, TRI, etc.). Again, addressing this issue through a meta-analysis will inform researchers as to whether performance differences exist based on the type of measure.

# Method

# Sample

We conducted an extensive search for reported correlations between indicators of CEP and CFP in the primary journals from multiple disciplines, including management, accounting, marketing, economics, and finance from 1970 through 2009. Our initial search used keywords including corporate environmental performance, environmental performance, environment, CEP, sustainability, corporate sustainability, green, green business, environmental strategy, social responsibility, corporate social responsibility, CSR, and environmental responsibility. In addition to electronic searches using EBSCO and ProQuest databases and manual searches of journals, we identified and examined potential articles from the sources cited in our retrieved article set, which resulted in a total of 72 studies in the original dataset. Any CEP–CFP Pearson product–moment correlation, reported directly or derived from reported t or d statistics was included in the analysis. The product–moment correlations were transformed using Fisher’s Z transformation. This resulted in a total of 39 usable studies with 202 samples that examined the CEP–CFP relationship. The large sample to study ratio resulted from several studies that included multiple operationalizations of CEP, CFP, or both. Consistent with the meta-analytical approach used in management literature, each of the authors independently analyzed and coded the CEP and CFP operationalizations. After comparing results, the authors arrived at a consensus for coding papers with multiple operationalizations. To ensure statistical independence, multiple correlations within moderator groups derived from the same samples were aggregated by calculating the mean of the correlations (Lipsey and Wilson 2001). This conservative approach resulted in 71 usable samples (n = 22,869).

# Procedure

Moderators were coded collectively by the authors based on characteristics of the measures and samples using the approach outlined above. Reactive environmental approaches included measures of compliance with legal requirements (e.g., TRI, fines and penalties), whereas proactive environmental strategies were coded based on environmental initiatives beyond regulatory requirements (e.g., sustainable development, employee involvement). In some cases, both approaches were reflected in a measure (e.g., KLD) and were coded accordingly. Several studies explicitly examined CEP for small firms (e.g., local utilities), which we compared against the majority of studies using large firms only (e.g., Fortune 500 firms). Similarly, studies using US-based samples were compared to studies using international-based samples. Several articles also explicitly used “worst offenders” as their sample by studying only high polluting industries (e.g., oil and gas, heavy manufacturing, EPA lists, etc.), which we compared to all others. The methodological moderators are fairly straightforward: financial performance measures were coded as either profitability (e.g., ROA) or market (e.g., market share); emissions measures included TRI, air pollution measures, waste disposal, etc.; and

# Results

Table 1 provides the meta-analytic results for the overall relationship between CEP and CFP. Similar to Orlitzky et al. (2003), results indicate it does pay to be green, with a mean correlation of 0.062 (71 samples, n = 22,869, p < 0.001). In order to establish a consensus between our baseline CEP–CFP relationship findings and that of prior meta-analytic literature, we further examine the similarities between the Orlitzky et al. (2003) sample of 17 studies prior to 1997 and our additional sample of 54 and find no statistical differences (Q = 0.31, p = 0.58). With similar results in the CEP–CFP relationship established, we extend our analysis to include the potential moderating effects of environmental performance type, firm-specific characteristics, and methodological issues to determine when and how it pays to be green.

# Reactive Versus Proactive Environmental Strategies

As previously noted, there are many environmental performance strategies incorporated by firms and examined throughout literature. For the purposes of this study, we focus on comparing the subgroup of reactive versus proactive environmental strategy measures in regards to their influence on the relation between environmental performance and firm financial performance, as well as comparing to measures reflecting both proactive and reactive initiatives simultaneously. Table 1 provides the results for each of the moderating variables and their subgroups. Contrary to our expectations, results indicate there is not a significant moderating effect in terms of the influences of proactive (r = 0.06) versus reactive (r = 0.07) environmental strategies on CEP (Q = 0.93, p = 0.63). Firms appear to benefit similarly, in terms of financial performance, from pursuing either proactive or reactive initiatives. Proactive strategies, surprisingly, do not appear to lead to greater financial returns than reactive approaches. Interestingly, firms pursuing both proactive and reactive strategies seem to benefit similarly to firms pursuing either one or the other strategy.

# Firm Characteristics

Another potential set of moderating variables affecting the CEP–CFP relationship is firm-specific characteristics. We analyze this relationship by forming subgroups of small versus large firms, public versus private firms, US-based versus internationally based firms, and worst environmental offenders versus the inclusion of a broader set of firms. In meta-analyzing the effect of firm size, we attempt to answer whether the benefits of environmental performance are different for large firms as opposed to small firms. In support of our expectations, results indicate there is a significant difference between samples of large firms versus small firms (Q = 5.91, p = 0.02). Samples including small firms have a greater effect on the correlation between CEP and CFP (r = 0.074) than those that only include large firms (r = 0.04). However, there does not seem to be a significant difference between public versus private firms (Q = 0.75, p = 0.39). The correlation between private firms CEP and CFP (r = 0.08) is not significantly different than the relationship between public firms CEP and CFP (r = 0.06).

A firm’s country of residence includes specific economic, social, legal, and political factors that may significantly influence a firm’s environmental performance. In order to assess the influence of these cross-border environmental differences, we examine these subgroups separately. As reported in Table 1, there is a significant difference in the moderating ability of US-based firms versus internationally based firms (Q = 4.47, p = 0.04). Specifically, US firms appear to benefit more (r = 0.07) than international counterparts (-0.01). Consequently, our

Expectation that these cross-border differences would influence the CEP–CFP relationship is supported. In examining the relationship between CEP and CFP a firm’s industry is often examined separately or used as a control variable because it is believed that the media attention, public pressure, and specific regulations are different for firms in industries with high pollution propensity. Our comparison of studies using firms from industries considered to be ‘worst offenders’ to studies incorporating firms from a broader set of industries reveals there is not a significant moderating effect for the pollution intensity of the firm’s industry (Q = 0.56, p = 0.46). Contrary to expectations, studies examining a broad set of firms found no significant differences between CEP and CFP (r = 0.07) as opposed to studies investigating only those firms from industries that are worst offenders (r = 0.05).

# Methodological Issues

As previously discussed, the methodology used in CEP–CFP studies has employed a variety of operationalizations of environmental performance and financial performance of firms. Meta-analyzing studies to determine whether different means of measuring environmental performance and firm performance renders valuable results. We performed a meta-analysis with the profitability, market-based, firm growth, cost-efficiency, and other outcomes, with each of the 202 samples being in one category. We report the results in Table 1. Our results indicate that the categories are statistically different from one another (Q = 14.90, p < 0.01) and statistically significant individually with each reflecting a positive CEP–CFP relationship. Overall, a review of the corrected effect sizes for the categories of financial outcomes measures indicates that CEP appears to influence market-based financial performance measures to a greater extent than other indicators (Table 2).

We further examine the moderating effect of methodological issues by examining the different measurements of environmental performance. We meta-analyze the subgroup of emissions measurements, such as toxic release, versus other environmental performance measurements (e.g., inclusion in independent environmental index). Contrary to expectations, results reveal the difference in operationalizing environmental performance does not significantly influence the CEP–CFP relationship (Q = 0.42, p = 0.52). In an attempt to clarify issues of causality, we examined studies in which environmental and financial performance (DV) were measured at the same point in time to those that utilized a minimum of a 1-year lagged dependent variable (i.e., financial performance measure). Contrary to expectations, we found no significant difference in outcomes regardless of whether the dependent variable was lagged or was measured simultaneously (Q = 0.00, p = 0.99).

Researchers have long criticized the use of self-report measures of environmental performance as having a bias.

towards increasing environmental performance and creating a false or heightened CEP–CFP link. In order to determine whether self-reported measures of environmental performance lead to a different relationship between CEP and CFP, we analyze a subgroup of methodological issues that includes self-report versus archival measures of environmental performance. Contrary to expectations, there is no significant difference in the outcomes when using self-reported measures as opposed to archival data (Q = 1.18, p = 0.28). Studies using self-reported measures of environmental performance do not seem to have a stronger association with firm financial performance (r = 0.06, r = 0.08).

# Supplemental Analyses

In addition to the meta-analysis, two supplemental analyses were performed to increase the robustness of the results. First, publication bias, also known as the file-drawer problem, is a potential threat with meta-analyses such that the published studies included in the sample may not be representative of all existing studies, including those unpublished. Following the method proposed by Orwin (1983), we found that the number of additional samples with a correlation of 0 that would be necessary to bring the effect size in this study of 0.062 down to 0.05 would be 17. To bring the effect size down to 0.04, would require an additional 39 additional samples, while doubling the number of samples with effect sizes of 0 would bring it down to about 0.03. Given the large number of additional samples necessary to substantially change the overall effect size we found in this study, we feel the results of our study are further strengthened.

A subsequent modified weighted regression analysis that provides for a simultaneous test of the proposed moderators was also performed. The analysis was conducted using an algorithm Lipsey and Wilson (2001) developed to correct for standard errors, which is run within SPSS. The results of the regression generally corroborate the findings of the meta-analysis, further suggesting robust results. Interestingly, the results do indicate that the international moderator is as important as in the bivariate analysis, whereas the emissions moderator attains significance.

# Discussion

As expected, our meta-analytic results of multiple studies of the general corporate environmental performance and financial performance link suggest a significant positive relationship, consistent with prior research (Orlitzky et al. 2003). In answering the question, “When does it pay (or not pay) to be green?” our results further suggest that important contingencies moderate the CEP–CFP relationship while others may not be as important as previously argued. Surprisingly, and contrary to existing theoretical frameworks (e.g., Aragon-Correa 1998; Sharma 2000; Henriques and Sadorsky 1999), proactive environmental initiatives do not appear to increase firm profitability more than reactive initiatives. Therefore, firms that go beyond regulatory requirements and focus on prevention by integrating environmental concerns into process innovation, stakeholder collaboration, employee involvement, and other proactive approaches may not necessarily expect greater financial returns than firms focusing on mere compliance or end-of-pipe methods. In either case, firms reap similar positive financial returns. Further, firms pursuing both strategies do not appear to benefit more than firms taking either a proactive or reactive approach. Perhaps there is still enough “low-hanging” fruit available for end-of-pipe solutions to be still profitable, although this could change over time as they run out. It is possible that proactive efforts are more comprehensive and thus more costly since they are not targeted at resolving a specific problem. Therefore, these efforts may lead to more costs and do not necessarily lead to direct revenue benefits. Reactive efforts would be more targeted and less costly. They also may reduce fines paid and still allow firms to capitalize on the benefits of stating that they are environmentally friendly.

Some firm characteristics do influence the CEP–CFP relationship while others do not. Our moderator analysis suggests that small firms seem to benefit from environmental performance as much or more than large firms. Perhaps small firms are able to compensate for a lack of slack resources by being more flexible (e.g., Chen and Hambrick 1995; Fiegenbaum and Karnani 1991; Storey 1994; Yu 2001). Private firms, however, do not appear to benefit any more than public firms. These firms may reap similar benefits through different means. The decreased public and media interest surrounding private firms may enable them to exercise more discretion in choosing the types of environmental initiatives they pursue (Dean et al. 1998). On the other hand, public firms may be able to capitalize on the environmental initiatives they do pursue as a result of additional media attention. Environmental performance also does not seem to matter any less for the “worst-offenders”, although subject to a different regulatory environment, than for other firms. Therefore, results of studies using samples consisting only of high polluting firms may be more generalizable than previously thought. Moreover, perhaps due to differences in economic, political, and social environments, US-based firms do appear to benefit more than international counterparts. This may be due to a more stringent regulatory environment in the US, wherein lower environmental performers end up being

penalized. It could also be due to other firms preferring to do business with compliant producers. International firms may be less likely to be held to the same standards, and in fact may be selected based on non- or even anti-environmental criteria, namely cost.

In response to past methodological-based criticisms of CEP–CFP research, we meta-analyzed the moderating role of financial and environmental performance measures and data sources. Interestingly, we did not find support for a number of moderators. This is particularly insightful given the abundance of evidence over these issues in the field. In this case, the lack of results provides important insights about CEP–CFP research and hopefully puts an end to some of the ongoing criticisms about this research. Environmental performance has a similar relationship with most indicators with the exception that market-based performance indicators have a stronger relationship than others. The choice of environmental performance measure has also been criticized. Yet, the relationship between CEP and CFP was consistent for emission measures (i.e., TRI) and other measures of environmental performance (i.e., KLD). This does not suggest that the choice of financial performance and environmental performance measures may not be guided by theory, only that from a practical standpoint, the choice of financial measures does not appear to be the reason for past inconsistencies in the literature. Further, from a practical standpoint, firms may reap a wide range of benefits from environmental initiatives given the robust and positive nature of the CEP–CFP relationship across a wide range of measures for both variables. We were also surprised to find no differences between studies utilizing a 1-year or more lagged financial performance variables and those measuring environmental and financial performance in the same year. It is possible that the use of a longer lag time criteria may offer different results. To date, little is understood regarding the time necessarily to fully capture the benefits of environmental initiatives, as the number of longitudinal studies remains limited. We also found that self-reported data does not tend to be more strongly associated with performance than archival measures. This suggests that self-reported measures of environmental performance may not be significantly biased after all. Overall, much of the criticism of CEP–CFP research methodology appears unfounded.

# Limitations and Future Research

The use of meta-analytic procedures is not without limitations. First, our results cannot demonstrate causality of the relationships tested. For example, it is possible that firms with strong financial performance are more likely to invest in environmental initiatives. Unfortunately, we did not have enough longitudinal studies examining the CEP–CFP relationship to analyze this issue. Future research should examine this important relationship. The measures of environmental performance that we used are the ones available from the existing studies and should be interpreted with caution. Contrary to existing frameworks, our findings that reactive and proactive environmental performance does not lead to significant differences in financial performance. Perhaps future research could evaluate different time horizons. It seems likely that reactive approaches are more likely to create immediate or short-term returns, whereas proactive initiatives require more significant up-front investment and may not pay off for longer periods of time. We feel this is an interesting area for future research to explore as well with additional theoretical development being especially important.

# Conclusion

The results of our meta-analysis confirm and extend the findings of Orlitzky et al. (2003) in demonstrating that existing empirical studies support the position that it “pays to be green.” However, our findings regarding the moderating influences on the CEP-CFP relationship suggest that future research should investigate additional moderating influences to better understand this relationship. Of particular interest would be relationships that help guide managers in understanding the conditions that lead to the greatest performance benefits when supporting the environment.

Abstract: Supply chain management environmental and social criteria are practical and research concerns due to regulatory, stakeholder, and economic pressures. Effective holistic sustainable supply management schemes require the evaluation and selection of suppliers. Supplier evaluation requires the balancing of multiple criteria. Multiple criteria tools, each with advantages and limitations, are necessary for the supplier evaluation and selection problem. This paper introduces a new methodological approach including complementary, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) techniques and Bayesian networks (BN). The combination of DEMATEL, AHP and Bayesian approaches, although they are supportive and complementary methods, has seen limited investigation. The Bayesian network approach can complement DEMATEL and AHP to help improve the accuracy of AHP input data. Alternatively, DEMATEL and AHP can provide expert and more objective inputs for intangible factors, used in the Bayesian network approach. The validity and efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through a real industrial case using decision-makers’ inputs and outputs. The study shows the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Finally, we present results with managerial and research implications and future research directions.

# 1. Introduction

In today’s business environment, most organizations have realized the critical nature of the relationship with suppliers and the importance of the strategic decision to evaluate and choose the best suppliers. Thus, many organizations refer to their suppliers as partners. On the other hand, organizations need to coordinate all their business activities, considering sustainability issues to gain competitive advantages [1]. Therefore, this relationship is no longer based on economic aspects.

Selecting a supplier is a strategic decision from multiple perspectives including customer satisfaction, technological ability and general business performance. Expanding this issue through sustainable supply chain management makes the choice and evaluation of suppliers even more critical and complex. Not surprisingly, the literature on sustainability and supplier selection (SS) is increasing. If selecting a supplier is a complex issue, selecting a sustainable supplier is even more complex. The dimensions to consider increase geometrically. New techniques that provide insightful knowledge and practical tools are required.

The implementation of sustainable practices is affected by different external factors. Ref. [1] stressed the necessity to be more involved not only in the internal process but also including.

Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584; doi:10.3390/su122410584 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584

the inter-organizational business systems and relationship with partners along the supply chain. Moreover, the implementation of sustainable initiatives is a complicated task without the cooperation with all partners in supply chain network. Therefore, the selection of suppliers based on integrated sustainability criteria using relevant methods can help companies to improve their sustainability performance. However, many present decision-making models regarding supplier selection focus on economic and environmental issues and less on social factors [2].

Many studies have reviewed the literature on supplier selection (SS) [3–5]. Indeed, the literature on supplier selection is extensive. Multiple criteria decision-making model (MCDM), mathematical programming (MP) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are some of the more popular approaches [6]. MCDM provides a methodological framework for decision support systems; MP is used to optimize or evaluate SS; AI identifies approximate solutions for complex optimization problems. MCDM approaches are the most popular, and within MCDM, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is most often applied [7]. AHP is very effective in ranking and selecting decision problems. It could be used alone or combined with other methods. Interaction and interdependent relationships among the evaluation criteria are critical and should be considered in order to evaluate a sustainable supplier [8]. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) can be valuable for this purpose.

In practical decision-making situations, the supplier selection problem is uncertain and imprecise. In risk assessment, researchers consider Bayesian network (BN) analysis as a helpful methodology for decision support under uncertainty. Although Bayesian analysis has been used for this issue [9], BN has not been used.

More precisely, more efforts are needed to take advantage of efficient techniques for selecting sustainable supplier in real cases [9]. In this sense, this research aims to answer the following research question: how to improve sustainable supplier selection and evaluation by using complementary approaches?

Given this situation, this study has the following objectives to answer the identified research question:

- To provide a global picture of research into the sustainable supplier selection problem;
- To propose a new decision-making tool using combined AHP-DEMATEL-BN methods in an uncertain environment for evaluating and selecting sustainable suppliers;
- To validate the proposed approach in a real case and provide some managerial and research insights.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the literature about supplier selection (SS) and sustainability in order to provide a global picture of research into the sustainable supplier selection problem. AHP, DEMATEL and BN for supplier selection problems will be the focus. The new approach, AHP-DEMATEL-BN, is explained and tested with a real case study in Section 3. The results are discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes and suggests some research avenues.

# 2. Literature Review

Many studies have demonstrated the importance of the supplier selection decision and its impact on overall supply chain network efficiency. Although SS is largely studied, the literature on sustainable supplier selection (SSS) problem is more limited [10]. SSS has been receiving more attention in recent years. Prior to 2005, there were only few papers, more or less one per year on SSS topics, reaching around 38 papers in 2014 [5]. Sustainable supplier selection faces similar methodological trends as those observed in supplier selection research. We shall only introduce some papers that have used the tools, separately, that we integrate in this study, to provide a foundation of the state-of-the-art modeling studies.

The literature considers multiple aspects of supplier selection. Sometimes, the focus is on a particular sustainability dimension. For example, the economic aspect for ranking suppliers is studied using AHP according to some criteria such as price, quality, delivery, and service using the case

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584

of the automotive industry in the developing country of Pakistan [ 11 ]. The authors highlighted the importance of developing a simple methodology for managers of the automotive industry so that they can select the best suppliers.

AHP as a standalone method has been used for evaluating criteria and ranking suppliers based on corporate social responsibility (CSR) dimensions [ 12 ]. These dimensions include human rights, underage labor, female labor, low working hours, pollution, safeguarding mechanisms and organizational legal responsibilities.

AHP has been also combined with a variety of methods; showing the flexibility of this tool, which we take advantage of in this study as well. As an example, some have used AHP to prioritize criteria and then VIKOR to rank suppliers [13 ]. Other studies identify the best sustainable supplier in similar ways but utilize TOPSIS instead of VIKOR as in [14]. Some studies have expanded supplier evaluation to multiple supply chain levels using these techniques [ 15 ]. Integration of statistical uncertainties into these joint MCDM models has not been explicitly completed.

Studies have also sought to link DEMATEL as a technique with MCDM approaches in order to consider interactions among criteria with selection purposes, e.g., [ 16 ]. Suggestions to add some sustainable criteria into these joint models have also appeared in studies [17, 18]. These and other works further highlight the necessity to integrate social criteria to advance their models [19].

Some studies have applied BN to supplier selection. BN can model the uncertainty and vagueness of human information [20 ]. It translates the decision-maker’s knowledge into probabilistic relationships. BN is capable of capturing tangible and intangible variables [21]. It is capable of integrating a learning process [ 22 ]. This integrative characteristic makes it even more valuable for the supplier selection process, since there are numerous uncertainties, from objective performance to intangible characteristics such as relational building. The relationship graphs within BN provide insights into the decision-maker’s understanding and thought processes. BN has traditionally been used as a standalone approach, and it can integrate broader frameworks [22 ]. For example, linking BN and total cost of ownership gives a dual perspective to buyer–supplier decision-makers [ 20, 23]. The malleability of BN and its advantages can help to address the disadvantages of other techniques that may not show a good path and uncertainty effectively.

DEMATEL may be used to elicit the BN structure. This rare integrative model is not a decision tool but is used for the structured analysis of relationships [19]. Adding MCDM methods to support decision-making has been recommended for this integrative approach. A recommended research avenue is to reinforce the descriptive model in using MCDM methods with DEMATEL and BN [ 24 ]. It is this additional step which we take—one that complements each of the various tools, allowing for more robust decision-making and analysis for sustainable supplier selection modeling.

In sustainable supplier selection (SSS), only two studies have used BN or Bayesian approaches [9, 25 ]. A Bayesian framework is provided and tested with an illustrative example to select a supplier for sustainable operations [ 9 ]. The resilience of suppliers in using forward and backward propagation analysis is studied [25 ], but not specifically for sustainable suppliers. The authors integrate resilience, green and primary indicators in their model. Then, they test it with a numerical sample. These studies have utilized operational criteria such as lead time, cost and quality alongside green criteria such as carbon emissions and environmental practices. They stipulate that other criteria need to be incorporated into their models. They indicate that further investigation needs to be extended to other supply chains and real data.

In our study, an additional research avenue is to apply the extended model of [ 24 ] to a real case of sustainable supplier evaluation and selection as suggested by [9]. A summary of studies in supplier selection problems is presented in Table 1, focusing on methods and types of decision criteria according to the triple bottom line (TBL) approach for supplier selection and evaluation.

The following is a summary of observations of the sustainable supplier selection problem and current methods are based on the literature review presented in this section:

- The three techniques are frequently used in the literature and combined with other techniques that help to build on each other’s capabilities, overcoming some of their weaknesses.
- Despite the large number of studies proposing the use of AHP, DEMATEL and BN (Table 1), there is no study that considers sustainability criteria and examines the interrelationships among them in order to evaluate and select the right supplier using AHP-DEMATEL-BN simultaneously.
- There is still limited literature that illustrates the use of these methods through a case example for the sustainable supplier selection problem in a practical and actual manufacturing setting.

Thus, the main purpose of this research work is to propose a new approach for sustainable partner selection by combining various decision-making techniques, taking advantage of their complementarities and addressing their weaknesses. An attempt is made to identify relevant evaluation criteria including sustainability aspects. This research work proposes a combined AHP-DEMATEL-BN framework for selecting the best sustainable supplier. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is an original effort in evaluating the suppliers in a real sustainable supply chain network based on the combination of these powerful techniques.

# 3. The AHP-DEMATEL-BN Approach

The contextual setting of this study is determining whether a supplier is a good partner for an organization, taking into consideration economic, environmental and social dimensions with uncertainties and limited information. Therefore, we propose a hydride approach based on AHP-DEMATEL-BN methods. Furthermore, the reasons and complementarities for combining AHP-DEMATEL-BN in this study include:

- AHP evaluates the decision problems hierarchically by decomposing the complex problem into simpler subproblems, while the DEMATEL approach effectively evaluates decision-makers’ priorities at an initial level of decision-making. The supplier selection problem is decomposed to three goal levels, sustainable aspects and criteria. The importance weights of each sustainability dimension for decision makers are calculated using AHP. Then, these weights are integrated into a BN model.
- AHP does not consider relations among the evaluation criteria and assumes that they are independent. DEMATEL’s complementarity deals with this issue. Using DEMATEL, the causal relations among the evaluation criteria are analyzed and the initial causal graph is proposed to build the BN model.
- AHP and DEMATEL cannot be used alone as a decision-making tool to explicitly evaluate uncertainties and limited information. However, BNs have dominant properties for making probabilistic calculations despite the unknown information for some evaluation criteria.
- By combining AHP, DEMATEL and BN, we model the sustainable supplier performance from both short-term and long-term viewpoints.

The proposed hybrid AHP-DEMATEL-BN approach is organized into five main steps as summarized in Figure 1.

Thus, we demonstrate an example depicted from a practical, real-life case problem in order to illustrate and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The situation discussed here is faced by an actual international manufacturing company.

The company has one site in France. It manufactures innovative industrial products for business clients by working on reducing water and energy consumption. It is a pioneering innovator in environmental approaches; it was recognized as a leader in environmental protection by the United States Agency for Environmental Protection and has been ISO14001 certified since 1997, with one of the earliest certifications in the world.

The manufacturing company wishes to evaluate its current and potential suppliers before choosing them for partnering. The company considers key factors affecting the sourcing functional efficiencies. The supplier is also evaluated and chosen using various sustainability criteria as part of the strategic organizational goal to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. Currently, the company has two suppliers, identified as S1 and S2. It has also another potential supplier, S3.

The study was conducted between September 2019 and February 2020. We started by a face-to-face meeting with different managers including a purchasing manager (DM1), a logistics manager (DM2) and a supply chain director (DM3) in the company under study. The objective of this meeting was first to better understand the problem and to validate the criteria found in the literature for the supplier selection problem with experts. Later, the same three decision-makers participated in each stage.

Thus, in the AHP stage, the three DMs in the company concerned was asked to answer a questionnaire including all possible pairwise comparisons for criteria. The questionnaire was presented in an Excel worksheet and sent by email for managers DM1, DM2, DM3. They jointly completed the questionnaire of the possible pairwise comparisons as they wanted to prioritize the criteria in the same way, so that they agreed on the preferences of the criteria. Thus, no aggregation was required for data at this stage. Then, we obtained matrix results and priority weights for evaluation criteria.

Next, in the DEMATEL stage, we sent by email also a questionnaire as an Excel worksheet for the three managers. Each decision-maker was asked to evaluate the direct influence of criterion “ci” on criterion “cj” using a linguistic scale. In order to aggregate the data from the three managers, the DEMATEL method was proposed to calculate the average matrix. Then, the sums of total effects and the net affect among all criteria are calculated.

Then, in the BN stage, we conducted first a meeting by video conference with the three managers in order to introduce the causal graph and the ordinal states (very low, low, medium, high and very high) that could be allocated for each criterion. These ranges were determined using feedback from three case company managers which were specific to their organization.

Then, decision-makers participated together a meeting and sent us by email data for case suppliers S1, S2 and S3, as a summary of their judgments regarding potential suppliers according to each criterion that was used as principal input in the BN model.

During the whole period, we also made intermediate online calls in order to present and discuss the results of each work package stage with the three decision-makers.

Then, the different steps of the proposed approach are explained through this case study.

# 3.1. Defining Sustainability Selection Criteria

This step is significant because a correctly identified set of criteria plays a vital role in supporting the decision-making process [6]. We define the criteria under economic (Eco), environmental (Env) and social dimensions (Soc) based on the literature review and the opinion of the decision-makers of the company. Thus, key decision criteria are investigated from a comprehensive literature review [5,9,15,25]. Then, these criteria are validated with decision-makers as an initial step in the sustainable supplier selection process. Criteria are defined as follows:

- Overall costs (Eco1): This is a key criterion for evaluating a supplier because it dictates the total supply chain cost. This criterion includes transportation and purchasing costs.
- Quality of product (Eco2): This is the capability of products and material to meet the quality standards for production processes. Scrap rate is used to determine the quality of delivered parts in this study.
- Quality of service (Eco3): This criterion represents the ability of a partner to satisfy demand and perform various functions in terms of delivery.
- Reducing pollution (Env1): The total emitted CO2 by each supplier is used to determine their performance regarding reducing pollution.
- Resource consumption (Env2): Suppliers are evaluated regarding the amount of energy consumption. Building energy performance indicator in kwh/m2/year is used.
- Environmental management system (Env3): The level of effort to reduce environmental impact is measured by an environmental management system certification (ISO 14001) (https://nbs.net/p/3-ways-smes-can-tackle-iso-14001-70c12e6b-8c15-428b-9c15-c248f08cf098). ISO 14001 has a progressive approach that breaks down the certification process into three successive levels.
- Employment practices (Soc1): This critical criterion defines the total commitment of a potential partner regarding employment. It refers to the level of temporary workers in this study.
- Health and safety (Soc2): Partners in the sustainable supply chain should aim to improve activities by minimizing health and safety incidents and implementing security practices to enhance the quality of life for employees. Number of incidents per year per 1000 employees is considered to evaluate the supplier.
- Responsibility to stakeholders and community (Soc3): Funds given by a supplier for educational, charitable purposes and to support community projects and social programs could be considered when evaluating suppliers in terms of social responsibility.

# 3.2.1. AHP for Sustainability Dimension Weights and Hierarchical Structure

AHP is one of the most popular MCDM methods. One study found that the technique is used as a standalone approach in around 19% of supplier selection studies [33]. The basic concept of AHP is to cluster the data into smaller groups and, using pairwise comparison, weight elements at each level.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584

It measures the decision-maker’s preference for one criterion over another by assigning a numerical value to the preference levels [34]. AHP is used to initially construct the BN model as a hierarchical structure. AHP assumes that criteria, at the same level of a hierarchy, are independent. In this study, the AHP for estimating the weights of selected criteria are summarized as follows:

# Step 1: Modeling the sustainable supplier selection problem as a hierarchical structure.

We model the supplier selection problem as a hierarchical structure including a goal to evaluate the supplier at the first level, sustainable dimensions at the second level and criteria at the third level. Nine criteria, summarized in Section 3.1, are assumed to be the most relevant sustainability criteria; this set is suggested by firm decision-makers and has been incorporated into this study.

# Step 2: Constructing the judgment matrices.

We construct the judgment matrices (CMs) for each level via pairwise comparisons with respect to the goal of selecting a sustainable supplier. The decision-maker (DM) preferences are based on comparing pairs of factors and are represented using a linguistic scale (equal importance = 1, somewhat important = 3, strongly more important = 5, very strongly more important = 7, extremely more important = 9, intermediate values = 2,4,6,8). A reciprocal value depending on the direction of preferences between pairs of factors populates the remaining portions of the matrix.

# Step 3: Computing the vector of criteria weights.

A pairwise comparison is a n × n real matrix where n is the number of criteria. Each entry αjk represents the preference weight of the jth criterion relative to the kth criterion. If αjk > 1, the jth criterion is more important than the kth criterion and vice versa. αjk and αk j follow the constraint:

αjk × αk j = 1 (1)

A normalized pairwise comparison matrix norm is derived from CM. Each entry αjk is computed as:

αjk = ∑l=1n αjkαlk (2)

An “n” dimensional column vector, the criteria weight vector ω, is built by averaging each αjk:

ωj = ∑l=1n αjlln (3)

The calculation is completed using MATLAB software. The consistency is evaluated using the consistency ratio (CR) suggested by [34].

By applying AHP to the case study, the relative importance of each pair of elements is prioritized using input from three case company decision-makers as experts. These managers include a purchasing manager (DM1), a logistics manager (DM2) and a supply chain director (DM3). They jointly completed a questionnaire of the possible pairwise comparisons. The comparison matrices (CMs) are constructed along the sustainability dimensions and sustainability criteria levels.

# Table 2. Matrix results for criteria level.

|Economic Criteria (ECO)|Eco1|Eco2|Eco3| | | | | | | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | |Env1|Env2|Env3| | | | | | | | | |
| | | | | |Soc1|Soc2|Soc3| | | | | | | |
| |1|1/3|5|1|5|3|1|1/5|1/3| | | | | |
| |3|1|3| | |1/5|1|3|5|1|5| | | |
| | | | | | |1/5|1/3|1|1/3|1/3|1|3|1/5|1|

Some revisions of judgment with the decision-makers (DMs) were necessary as some matrix consistency ratios exceeded 0.1. By applying AHP steps and using MATLAB software, the importance

weights of dimensions (Weco, Wenv, Wsoc) are (0.618, 0.297, 0.086), respectively, with a consistency ratio (CR) of 0.07 (see Table 3). The economic factor is the most significant dimension in selecting a supplier for the DMs, with the highest value of priority weights W = 0.618.

# Table 3. Priority weights of evaluation criteria using the AHP method.

|Dimensions|Weights|Criteria|Total Weights|Consistency|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|ECO (0.618)| |Eco1|0.350|CR = 0.090|
| | |Eco2|0.067| |
| | |Eco3|0.199| |
|ENV (0.297)| |Env1|0.193|CR = 0.086|
| | |Env2|0.038| |
| | |Env3|0.066| |
|SOC (0.086)| |Soc1|0.008|CR = 0.078|
| | |Soc2|0.017| |
| | |Soc3|0.060| |

Under the economic dimension, “Eco1: cost” is the most important criterion, with a total relative weight of 0.350. “Env1: reducing pollution” is the most important criterion under the environmental dimension, with a total weight of 0.193. Consequently, suppliers should focus on pollution reduction to help maintain an advantage over competing suppliers. “Soc3: responsibility to stakeholders and community” is the most significant criterion for supplier social consideration. The summary weights of the various dimensions and criteria presented in Table 3 are used as inputs in the BN model.

# 3.2.2. DEMATEL for Direct Relations and Causal Graph

The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method is a tool determining importance and causal relationships amongst various evaluation criteria [35]. This method may confirm interdependence among variables. DEMATEL results in grouping factors into “cause” and “effect” categories between factors. DEMATEL is used to build the initial BN causal graph using the final direct relationship matrix [24]. The various steps of DEMATEL are outlined as follows:

Step 1: Constructing the initial relationship matrices.

Assume there are n identified evaluation criteria for supplier selection made by m decision-makers. Each decision-maker is asked to evaluate the direct influence of criterion ci on criterion c. This influencej is assigned an integer linguistic scale value including 0 (no influence), 1 (low influence), 2 (medium influence), 3 (high influence) and 4 (very high influence). X1, X2, X3, . . . , Xm form an initial relation matrix, Xk = [xijk], where k is the decision-maker participating in the evaluation process (1 ≤ k ≤ m).

Step 2: Calculating the average matrix.

To aggregate all judgments from m decision-makers, the average matrix A = [aij] is calculated using expression (4):

A = [aij] = 1/m ∑xijm k

Obtaining the normalized initial direct relation matrix.

The normalized initial direct relation matrix R = [rij], where rij (0, 1) can be obtained using expression (5).

R = λ ∗ A

λ = Min(max∑n=1|aij|,1≤j≤n∑n=1|aij|)

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10584

# 10 of 23

factors. The value maxn∑nThe value maxn∑nj=1∣∣∣aij∣∣∣ indicates the value of the factor with the maximum direct effect on other 1≤i≤ i=1∣∣∣aij∣∣∣ is the factor which is most affected by other factors. A positive scalar matrix λ is the upper bound and allocates the lowest value of these two to itself. The matrix R is obtained by dividing each element of matrix A by a scalar value λ. Each rij element from matrix R is a value between zero and one.

# Step 3: Calculating the total relation matrix.

A continuous decrease in the indirect effects of problems along the powers of matrix R, e.g., R2, R3 . . . ., R∞, guarantees convergent solutions to the matrix inversion, similar to an absorbing Markov chain matrix. The full influence matrix F = [fij], where fij represents the full direct and indirect influence exerted by criterion ci on criterion c, can be determined using expression (6):

F = R(1 − R)−1 (6)

where I is the identity matrix.

# Step 4: Calculating the total cause and effect including joint direct and indirect effects.

Each row sum and column sum of matrix T is calculated using expressions (7) and (8), respectively:

q = [qi]n×1 = [∑j=1n Fij] (7)

P = [pj]n×1 = [∑i=1n Fij] (8)

The value qi indicates the total direct and indirect effects which criterion i has on other criteria. The value of pj indicates the direct and indirect effects of all other criteria on criterion j. Thus, when j = i, the sum (qi + p) yields an index representing the total effects on and by criterion i. In other words, (qi + p) represents the prominence (degree of importance) that criterion i has in the system of criteria. The difference (qi − p) indicates the net effect that criterion ci has on the system. When (qi − p) is positive, criterion ci is a net causer, and when (qi − p) is negative, criterion i is a net receiver.

# Step 5: Producing causal and effect diagram.

The threshold value μ is computed by averaging the elements in matrix F in order to eliminate some minor effect relationships amongst factors in matrix F (see expression (9)):

μ = [∑i=1n ∑j=1n Fij] (9)

where L is the total number of elements in the matrix F. The values of elements in matrix F are set to zero if their values are less than μ. That is, no influence is assumed with other criteria when values are less than μ. Finally, the network relationship map is determined by mapping the dataset of (q + p, q − p), where the horizontal axis (q + p) is made by adding q to p, and the vertical axis (q − p) is made by subtracting q from p.

We apply these steps to the case study. Xk represents the data gathered from the three decision-makers. The average matrix Aeco for economic criteria was established by using Equation (4).

Aeco = [0 0.667 1]

The normalized initial direct relation matrix Reco was calculated using Equation (5):

Reco =
                           
    0     0.111     0.15   

                           
0.50       0        0

The total relation matrix Feco is used for constructing a causal graph for a BN. The threshold value μ = 0.219 is defined. The values that were greater than μ = 0.219 represent the direct relation links between criteria. For example, the value of REco21 (0.571) > μ (0.219), the arrow in the causal map, is drawn from Eco2 to Eco1. Eco3 directly influences Eco1 as Reco31 (0.571) > μ (0.219). The total relation matrix Feco was calculated using Equation (3).

Feco =
                               
  0.143     0.114     0.171    

                               
0.571     0.057     0.085

The sums of rows and columns of matrix Feco were calculated by using Equations (7) and (8) as summarized in Table 4.

# Table 4. The sums of total effects and the net affect among economic criteria.

| |Eco1|Eco2|Eco3|q|p|q + p|q − p|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Eco1|0.143|0.114|0.171|0.484|1.286|1.714|−0.857|
|Eco2|0.571|0.057|0.085|0.714|0.228|0.943|0.486|
|Eco3|0.571|0.057|0.086|0.714|0.343|1.057|0.371|

The importance of economic criteria is determined using the prominence index representing the total effects both directed to and from each criterion. Cost (Eco1) is the most prominent (important) evaluation criterion with the largest (q + p) value = 1.714, whereas quality of product (Eco2) is the least important criterion with the smallest (q + p) value = 0.943. From the (q + p) values, the criteria prioritization is Eco1 > Eco3 > Eco2, confirming the AHP results.

Using the net effect (q − p) values, the criteria are divided into cause groups with positive (q − p) values and effect groups with negative (q − p) values. In this study, the Eco3 and Eco2 are considered as net cause, having the (q − p) values of 0.486 and 0.371, respectively. In the effect group, cost (Eco1) is classified as a net receiver, with a (q − p) value of −0.857.

The same process is repeated in order to obtain the cause and effect relationships among the environmental and social criteria as shown in Tables 5 and 6.

# 3.3. Defining the States and Parametrizing the Bayesian Network Model

BNs are network probabilistic models based on Bayes’ theorem and can be utilized for decision support. Bayes’ theorem considers prior probabilities about events and develops predictions based on new information. The fundamental property of BN can be simply explained as follows [36]: realized, ∑j=1n = 1, 2..n, i , j. The event I is observed, which can occur only under the condition that a set of disjunctive events is considered S = {S1, S2,..., Sn}, where one of them is (Sj)

P = 1. The occurrence of one event excludes the occurrence of others Sj ∩ Si = ∅, i, j some of the events S, j = 1, 2,.., n have already occurred. Then, the conditional probability of event Sr,j given that the event I has already been realized, is calculated using expression (10):

P(Sr/I) = P(Sr)P(I/Sr)P(I) = ∑j=1nP(Sr)P(I/Sj) (I/Sr) (10)

where P(S) is the probability of event S, i.e., the starting or an a priori probability. P(I) is the probability of event I. P(I/S) is the probability of event I, given that event Sj has occurred (conditional probability). P(S/I) is the probability of an event Sj given that event I has occurred (revised or a posteriori probability).

A BN begins with a graphical structure which is composed of nodes and arcs. Nodes represent events and arcs represent direct causal relationships between events. If there is an arc from event A to B, this means that event A is a parent of event B, and event B is a child of event A. The causal relationship between events can be described in terms of conditional probabilities. A BN structure can be constructed using expert knowledge. This construction is not trivial, especially when multiple decision-makers are used. However, a generally accepted method to build BN structures with decision-makers does not exist.

BNs are able of handling qualitative (poor/fair/good), Boolean (yes/no) or quantitative variables. Data representing these events are called states and may be derived from historical data, expertise or a combination of the two. The parameters of a BN are encoded in node probability tables (NPT). Each node has an associated NPT that defines the conditional probability distribution of that node conditioned on its parents.

After defining the states for each criterion, the BN parameters are determined using a ranked nodes method.

There are two types of variables used in the proposed BN model:

Qualitative variables have ranked responses with five ordinal states including very low, low, medium, high and very high for dimensions and criteria levels. These variables are represented by a ranked nodes method that reduces the number of parameters needed for each variable and simplifies the definition of NPTs for decision-makers. Ranked nodes assume a truncated normal (TNormal) distribution with a central tendency towards the probability of parent nodes due to a weighted function [24]. In this study, a weighted average (wmean) function for the ranked nodes is used. This function requires a coefficient and a variance parameter for every parent variable. These parameters are defined using AHP results for sustainable dimension nodes. The DEMATEL results are used for the criteria nodes.

Boolean variables have binary responses with true or false states. These variables are represented in the supplier selection node. For example, if (parents > 0.6, “True”, “False”), meaning “if the sum of the parent values is greater than 0.6 then the value is ‘True’; otherwise, it is ‘False’”.

Five ordinal states (very low, low, medium, high and very high) are introduced for each criterion. These ranges are determined using feedback from three case company managers which are specific to their organization. The specific ranges for variable states for each criterion are summarized in Tables 7–9.

# Table 7. Economic criteria states and ranges.

|State|Eco1 (Cost)|Eco2 (Scrap Rate)|Eco3 (Delivery on Time)|

Ranked nodes are used to parametrize the sustainable aspects and criteria nodes with weighted average (wmean) function in the case study. For the “wmean” function, we need to define a coefficient for each variable and a variance parameter.

For example, in the broader sustainability dimensions level of BN, the parents of the node “economic dimension” (Eco) are (Eco1, Eco2 and Eco3). The weights of these parents were defined from the values obtained by AHP as shown in Table 3.

The variance values for the ranked nodes were defined by the variance of the DEMATEL responses for the economic dimension (ECO). For example, when we asked the decision-makers (DM1), (DM2), (DM3) to answer the question “How much does cost (Eco1) influence the economic dimension (Eco)?”, they answered in different ways using the linguistic scale values (1 low, 2 medium, 3 high), respectively. Then, we calculate the variance of these answers by taking the difference between the largest and smallest valued responses, as shown in Table 10.

**Table 10. Means and variances of effects of Eco1, Eco2 and Eco3 on Eco.**
|Parameters|How Much Does Cost (Eco1) Influence the Economic Dimension (Eco)?|How Much Does Quality of Product (Eco2) Influence the Economic Dimension (Eco)?|How Much Does Quality of Service (Eco) Influence the Economic Dimension (Eco)?|
|---|---|---|---|
|Mean|0.350|0.067|0.199|
|Variance|0.01|0.01|0.01|

At the criteria level, the weights of each parent were defined based on their coefficients in the average direct relation matrix obtained from DEMATEL. For example, the parents of cost (Eco1) are (Eco2 and Eco3). The weights of these parents were defined from the values in matrix Aeco. The variance values for the ranked nodes were defined by the sum of variances of the DEMATEL questionnaire responses for Eco1 in Table 11.

**Table 11. Means and variances of effects of Eco2, Eco3 on Eco1.**
|Parameters|How Much Does (Eco2) Influence (Eco1)?|How Much Does (Eco3) Influence Cost (Eco1)?|
|---|---|---|
|Mean|3.33|3.33|
|Variance|0.333|0.333|

The overall final target node is the supplier selection variable. This node provides a probability statement about whether the supplier should be selected, conditioned on environmental, social and economic nodes and considering their weights.

The supplier selection node is defined by a Boolean variable for which a probability measures whether a criterion is met (True) or not (False). The Boolean expression is (0.618 * Eco + 0.297 * Env + 0.086 * Soc > 0.6, “True”, “False”) based on the importance given to these criteria by the decision-makers according to the AHP results (Table 3). This means that the global performance of the supplier should be at least 60% but can be determined by the company. The value of 60% was determined according to the decision-makers and it can be unique according to specific company requirements.

After the parameters of all nodes are determined, the initial BN model is evaluated using “AgenaRisk” software as shown in Figure 3. In this initial BN, the decision regarding the selection of the supplier is approximately 71% false and 29% true. This means that if this supplier is selected, there is only a 29% probability that they will actually be the best overall performer.

# 3.4. Completing a Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis provides evidence for the robustness of the solution. The objective is to verify how much each criterion is affected by the variation in the other criteria or parameters. This may also help to determine the most influential criteria. Sensitivity analysis was proposed using a tornado graph.

The length of the bars in the tornado graphs can be considered as the measure of the impact of sensitivity variables on the target variable and the sensitivity of this variable on other variables.

For example, a sensitivity analysis was performed for the supplier evaluation node with respect to economic, environmental and social aspects. The probability of supplier selection being true and false is 29% and 71%, respectively, as illustrated in the tornado graphs in Figures 4 and 5. From these figures, we see that the probability of selecting a supplier is more sensitive to the changes in the value of the economic dimension and least sensitive to changes in social dimension values. We also carried out the sensitivity analysis regarding the criteria. For example, if the overall Eco dimension is “Very High”, given that the criteria parents remain equal, then the probability of selection of this supplier is 93.3%, meeting the performance expectations. In Figure 5, we see that if Eco = very low, then it is 100% likely not to be selected (this is also true in Figure 4, which shows a 0.000 probability of supplier selection = True when Eco = very low).

What-if scenario analyses (predictive analyses) are also conducted to evaluate the inferences of the model based on decision-maker knowledge. Such analyses can be performed by entering a number of observations into the BN to update the marginal probabilities of any unobserved variables. The objective is to examine how the posterior probabilities of the supplier selection criteria change when different evidence is entered into the model. For instance, we tested the impact of unknown information of some criteria on the decision for selecting a supplier. In scenario 1, we assumed information that there was a very high level for “health and safety (Soc2)” in the social dimension, very high level for “quality of product (Eco2)” in the economic dimension and with no information in the environmental dimension.

We can see that by increasing the health and safety (Soc2) result, considerable improvement is seen in social criteria employment practices (Soc1) from 20% to 82% (very high) and responsibility to stakeholders and community (Soc3) from 20% to 90% (very high). Considerable improvement is seen also in cost (Eco1) from 8.2% to 30% (very high) as a result of increasing product quality (Eco2) from 20% to 100% as shown in Figure 6. The overall decision for selecting this supplier is now 55.69% true; previously, this result in the base case was 29.3% true.

|Supplier selection|False|True|
|---|---|---|
|Soc|44.306%|55.694%|
|Env|Very Low|20.292%|
|Low|11.4045| |

In scenario 2, as shown in Figure 7, we include the new environmental performance of the supplier. Assume that a high level of performance for (Env1) occurred, meaning that the supplier produced a very...

small quantity of total emitted CO2, possibly through improved supply and transport activities. Based on this information, our model predicts a high level in the environmental dimension. The decision about selecting this supplier now increases to approximately 71% true.

Figure 7. Scenario 2: very high health and safety (Soc2) and quality of product (Eco2) and high reduction in pollution (Env1).

In scenario 3, presented in Figure 8, we have information only about the quality of service (Eco3) as a low level in the economic aspect and a high level of resource consumption (Env2) in the environmental aspect, and no social criteria information is provided. Based on this information, the probability of the economic performance being low is 41.049%. Thus, the decision about selecting this supplier is 82.245% false due to the very high importance of the economic dimension.

|Very High|High -|19.717%|

Figure 8. Scenario 3: low quality of service (Eco3) and high resource consumption (Env2).

In summary, the proposed model enables the decision-makers to conduct a wide variety of scenario analyses with incomplete information. The information about supplier criteria can be conflicting, and the analyses could be revised when more information becomes available. Thus, the proposed BN are validated by decision-makers according to this sensitivity analysis.

# 3.5. Applying the Proposed Bayesian Network Model

In this case study, three alternative suppliers (S1, S2, S3) for a component to be purchased by the company are evaluated by the decision-makers. The manufacturer worked with supplier S1 and S2 before and they have some information from past experience. S3 is a new potential supplier with limited information from previous experience.

The offered component price by supplier S3 is USD 120. Thus, supplier S3 was assigned a medium level for criterion Eco1. The company asked S3 to send sample parts, the supplier delivered the parts on time, Eco2, and had a rejection rate &lt; 1%. Eco3 is considered “high” in this case. For S3 environmental performance, the managers do not know the total emitted CO2 (Env1) or the energy performance indicator (Env2) of supplier S3. This supplier has implemented an environmental management system in order to obtain an environmental certification (Env3). For the social dimension, this supplier did not provide any information about employment practices (Soc1) or about the number of incidents (Soc2). They indicated a social responsibility budget (Soc3) as 7% of sales.

The managers have no information about the total carbon emissions (Env2) caused by supplier S2 activities. There is also no information about energy consumption (Env2). A summary of this and other case information from suppliers S1, S2, S3 is presented in Table 12.

**Table 12. Data for case Suppliers S1, S2 and S3.**
|Criteria|S1|S2|S3|
|---|---|---|---|
|Eco1|High|Medium|Medium|
|Eco2|High|High|High|
|Eco3|High|High|Very high|
|Env1|No information|High|No information|
|Env2|Medium|No information|No information|
|Env3|High|No information|High|
|Soc1|High|High|No information|
|Soc2|Low|Medium|No information|
|Soc3|Medium|Medium|High|

We entered the values from Table 12 into the BN model results for suppliers S1, S2, S3. The results are illustrated in Figure 9.

Figure 9. BN model for suppliers S1, S2 and S3.

# 4. Results Analysis and Managerial Implications

Based on sustainable criteria evaluation using AHP, the economic factor is the most significant dimension in selecting a supplier with the highest value of priority weights W = 0.618 for DMs. This helps DMs to understand the current state of practice in sustainable supplier selection in the company and to review and update their priorities regarding sustainability criteria.

On the other hand, after sharing the priorities with partners, they will pay more attention regarding the criteria which are more important for the DMs. For instance, for supplier S1, the social responsibility budget (Soc3) is only 2% of sales and this criterion is the most important criterion under the social aspect for DMs in the evaluation of the supplier. Thus, supplier S1 should increase this percentage of Soc3 to be better evaluated.

For DMs, the lack of certain information concerning the performance of the supplies should not prevent the possibility of an adequate evaluation. The proposed BN model allowed decision-makers to evaluate the global performance of each supplier despite the missing information regarding one criterion for supplier S1, two criteria for S2 and four criteria for supplier S3.

Thus, based on the evidence from past experience of supplier S1, the BN model predicts medium performance (approximately 52.76%) or high performance (approximately 47.24%) of reducing pollution quantity (Env1) due to the existence of a highly ranked environmental management system (Env3). Thus, selecting S1 as a partner is approximately 75% true. This result confirms the opinions of the decision-makers.

For supplier S2, the model predicts high-level performance for energy consumption (Env2), with a probability of 78.07% and also high-level performance for environmental management system criterion (Env3) with a probability of 76.68% as it demonstrates high performance in reducing pollution criterion (Env1). Its global economic performance (Eco) is predicted to be 50.31%, a medium level, which should be improved as this criterion is the most important for DMs in this case. The final decision about selecting supplier S2 is 58.2% true and 41.7% false. Therefore, supplier S2 should improve some areas of performance in order to satisfy the requirement level as a sustainable supplier. The result reinforces the decision-maker’s opinion about supplier S2. The company knew that S2 was not performing exceptionally well but did not know at which level and where S2 could improve. This model was useful in identifying some means of improving S2’s performance, allowing the company to strengthen collaboration by aiding in supplier development.

Using the incomplete information that decision-makers have about supplier S3, its environmental and social performance is likely to be high with probability (68.69%, 75.22%), respectively. Moreover, despite the high uncertainty due to the lack of information regarding the environmental criteria (Env1) and (Env2), social criteria (Soc1) and (Soc2), selecting S3 is approximately 76.4% true. This result is due to the high-level probability forecast of 58.91% in its global economic performance. The decision-makers believe that they can establish a partnership with this company.

Mathematically complex approaches are often not easily understood and useable by decision-makers. Here, the methodology feedback from the managerial decision-makers was very positive. They find the model easy to use and helpful in evaluating suppliers. Causal expert-driven BNs are usually complex. By combining AHP, DEMATEL and BNs, we simplify the building of the model while developing some methodological consistency. Using different types of events including Boolean and qualitative make the model flexible. Further, different sources of data ranging from historical to actual evidence were valuable as well and could be effectively integrated overall into the BN model. Furthering transparency and replicability in a clear rigorous process builds the legitimacy of the model. The graphical nature of the BN results makes the technique more accessible to management, furthering managerial acceptance. The clarity and legitimacy are important when seeking the adoption of decision tools and models in organizations.

The proposed model is based on theoretical aspects and dimensions supported by organizational needs and requirements. Additionally, the results could have been varied in as required by the organizational decision-makers to further validate their specific “what-if” scenarios. The approach

# 5. Conclusions

# 5.1. Summary of Findings and Contributions

Evaluating and selecting suppliers according to the triple bottom line (TBL) approach can reinforce sustainable performance in supply networks. In practical situations, this task is a complicated multi-criteria decision-making problem and time-consuming assignment. This decision is generally imprecise and uncertain, with limited and unknown information. This study provides a global picture for sustainable supplier selection problems and proposes a decision-making tool using a combined, harmonized, AHP-DEMATEL-BN method. The decision environment provided some uncertainty for evaluating and selecting sustainable suppliers. The proposed approach could easily convert decision-maker knowledge and preferences into meaningful results. An actual case example for the sustainable supplier selection problem in a manufacturing company provided some managerial and research insights.

This research contributes to the field of sustainable supplier selection by incorporating judgment with actual data. Historical and unknown information were also integrated into the evaluation. These are real situations, which no one model can capture.

Based on AHP, DMs were able to evaluate sustainable criteria and to understand their current priorities in the supplier evaluation process. Using DEMATEL, the interactions among evaluation criteria with selection purposes were also clearly identified. The BN model allowed decision-makers to incorporate incomplete information and missing data. Thus, despite the high uncertainty due to the lack of information concerning the evaluation of certain suppliers, DMs were able to evaluate them in a clear, rigorous process.

Thus, the obtained results offer guidelines for analysts and decision-makers in order to understand the current issues related to the sustainable supplier selection process. These results can also help decision-makers to control evaluation criteria and to improve the relationships with their selected suppliers. This research demonstrated some of the advantages and disadvantages of each method. It was shown that AHP, DEMATEL and BN were good, complementary approaches.

# 5.2. Limitations

However, the approach has some limitations. We only focused on a small set of potential criteria for supplier evaluation and selection. In some cases, dozens of factors can be considered. In this situation, the decision environment becomes more complex. For instance, using AHP with more than nine evaluation criteria at the same level of hierarchy requires grouping some of them into an overall criterion and creating sub-criteria. Some filtering to key performance indicators (KPI) may be required for the methodology to remain tractable. As we have mentioned, one of the important characteristics of any model, its usefulness and acceptance, is dependent on how well managers understand the whole process. In this case, although some of the AHP analysis may be intuitive, the BN required greater explanation. Moreover, the use of the hydride approach based on AHP-DEMATEL-BN methods seems quite complicated for decision-makers in companies while selecting the supplier. Alternatively, the rigor provides an avenue for analysts to convince managers of the scientific propensity of the technique, further justifying decisions.

# 5.3. Future Research Directions

Although we believe that our study can provide a new framework and a decision-making tool for selecting and evaluating suppliers in the sustainable supply chain, our research work could be expanded and improved in future research. Some future directions are identified as follows:

- This study was more methodologically oriented as the research showed how the methodology can integrate various complex issues in managerial decision-making. As the problem size increases, the applicability and accuracy of the model will require further investigation. For example, what if the number of factors increases regarding the number of alternatives or criteria?
- A complete validation of the study will be undertaken by considering more scenarios. Experimenting with the methodology would be worthwhile to determine if all scenarios are supportive. For example, what if all the data were known, or only known data were utilized? What if none of the data were known and it was a completely new product with new suppliers? How well can the model learn? These are all questions that may be asked in various experimental scenarios or in long-term longitudinal studies.
- It will be also useful to expand the BN model with indicators for some criteria and to consider the decision-maker characteristics; for example, would supply chain managers differ from engineering or marketing managers?
- Furthermore, the proposed model can be solved by using other approaches and the obtained results can be compared with each other using the Spearman rank correlation method, such as multiple criteria tools including ANP, TOPSIS and PROMETHEE, to name a few. Otherwise, different methods can be compared regarding the time, the complexity and the restriction on the number of alternatives or criteria used in the selection process in order to identify which method is more robust.
- Additionally, this study can be extended to other domains for evaluation and selection decision-making problems. The update of the evaluation criteria according to each specific case will be necessary.

Finally, we sought to integrate a series of tools and found the technique useful and feasible. Thus, we continue to build on the important supplier selection field and knowledge.

# Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Disclosures: A Meta-Analytical Review

# Abstract

Purpose – This study investigates the association between corporate governance and corporate social disclosures.

Design/methodology/approach – Data Analysis has been conducted on 29 prior studies published between 2004 and 2016 for the purpose of integrating the findings across studies. The study uses the meta-analysis instrument developed by Hunter et al. (1982).

Findings – The investigation finds a significant positive association between board size, the frequency of board meetings, and auditors’ credibility with Corporate Social Disclosures (CSD). Both the managerial and concentrated ownership are also a significant but negative association with CSD. In contrast, board independence, board gender diversity, the composition of non-executive directors, government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership are insignificantly and positively associated with CSD. CEO duality is also insignificant with CSD but indicates a negative association. The study further investigates that the association between board gender diversity and CSD affected by the differences of the country of study.

Originality/value – This paper adds significance to the extant academic literature as well as assisting the appropriate policy maker in assessing the determinants of corporate social disclosures from the viewpoints of corporate governance. It further aims to reconcile the findings of the previous studies around the world, and also for the developed and developing countries separately.

# 1. Introduction

Due to several corporate scandals (for example, Enron, Ahold, WorldCom, Lehman Brothers and Parmalat), recent financial crisis, and changing the mix of the business environment with the rising demand from various stakeholders have brought more devotion to the corporate governance (CG) and corporate social disclosures (CSD). Corporate governance and social disclosures are related to each other (Haniffa and Cooke, 2005, Said et al., 2009, Kathy Rao et al., 2012). CG ensures the interest of the shareholders, and it plays a vital role to the corporate accountability by disclosing social issues (Hossain and Alam, 2016). Dellaportas et al. (2012) find if the disclosure level of the organization increases, it will create advantages for that organization. As a result, every company should disclose their economic, social and environmental activities to their valuable stakeholders (Said et al., 2009).

The meaning of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and CSD differ in the context of various stakeholder groups and companies around the world (Dawkins and Lewis, 2003, Igalens and Gond, 2005, Welford et al., 2008). As a country, USA is the pioneer in the arena of CSR and CSD (Giannarakis, 2014b) and companies in that country still meets the desire of their shareholders by providing CSD as a voluntary disclosure (Tschopp, 2005, Rodríguez and LeMaster, 2007). The evidence shows that a number of research connected to CSD have investigated in the developed and developing countries. But, much of the evidence of previous literature provides qualitative descriptions regarding the nature, contents and motivational factors of CSD (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001, Newson and Deegan, 2002, Campbell, 2007, Van Beurden and Gössling, 2008, Uzma, 2016, Neu et al., 1998, Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975, Teoh and Thong, 1984, Guthrie and Parker, 1989, Andrew et al., 1989, Guthrie and Parker, 1990, Roberts, 1992, Patten, 1992, Clarkson, 1995, Donaldson and Preston, 1995, Deegan and Gordon, 1996, Adams et al., 1998, Adams et al., 1995, Deegan and Rankin, 1997).

In the existing literature, a microscopic research has been investigated on the determinants of CSD as well, e.g., (Hackston and Milne, 1996, Alnajjar, 2000, Naser et al., 2006, Hawani Wan Abd Rahman et al., 2011, Giannarakis, 2013, Muttakin and Khan, 2014, Giannarakis, 2014b, Barakat et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Nurhayati et al., 2016).

Moreover, there is relatively less devotion has been given to set up a direct link between CG and CSD (Khan et al., 2013, Razak and Mustapha, 2013, Sufian and Zahan, 2013, Giannarakis, 2014a, Kiliç et al., 2015, Deschênes et al., 2015, Majeed et al., 2015, D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Dunn and Sainty, 2009, Ibrahim and Hanefah, 2016, Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007).

The empirical findings of the previous literature in connection to CG and CSD provide inconclusive results. For example, Dunn and Sainty (2009) and Ibrahim and Hanefah (2016) provide evidence that board independence has a significant impact on CSD. In contrast, Lim et al. (2008) and Razak and Mustapha (2013) suggests that no significant impact of board independence on CSD. Besides that, Javaid Lone et al. (2016) documented that there is a significant link between board size and CSD. However, Razak and Mustapha (2013) show the insignificant relationship between board size and CSD. In addition, Majeed et al. (2015) find that board gender diversity has a significant impact on CSD.

side, D.Sundarasen et al. (2016) provide evidence that no significant impact exists between board gender diversity and CSD.

Contrary to previous findings above, our study aims to address the meta-analysis technique for finding out the links on the corporate governance and corporate social disclosures. In this context, this paper synthesizes 29 previous studies by conducting the meta-analysis technique developed by Hunter et al. (1982) to give a fruitful result on the CG and CSD relationship.

The social science researcher is more devoting on the use of meta-analysis technique but limited applications by the researcher of accounting (Eddine et al., 2015, Khlif and Souissi, 2010, Ahmed and Courtis, 1999). To the best of our awareness, no prior studies examined the association between corporate governance and corporate social disclosures by using the meta-analysis technique. Hence, this study contributes to the contemporary literature to fill up this research gap. Furthermore, the findings of the investigation present a combined result of the prior studies based on different countries which are ultimately providing a better understanding to assess the determinants of corporate social disclosures. Moreover, this meta-analysis technique adds contributions not only in the accounting research arena but also other areas of research.

In the present study, the meta-analysis incorporates twelve corporate governance variables as explanatory variables. These variables are board independence, board Size, board gender diversity, the frequency of board meetings, the composition of non-executive directors, CEO duality, auditors’ credibility, government ownership, foreign ownership, institutional ownership, managerial ownership, and concentrated ownership. The study results imply that there is a significant positive relationship exists between board Size, the frequency of board meetings, and auditors’ credibility with Corporate Social Disclosures (CSD). Both the managerial and concentrated ownership are also a significant but negative association with CSD. In contrast, there is an insignificant positive association finds between board independence, board gender diversity, the composition of non-executive directors, government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership. CEO duality is also insignificant with CSD but indicates a negative association. The study further investigates that the association between board gender diversity and CSD affected by the differences of the country of study. The association reveals significant positive for the developed countries but insignificant positive for the developing countries.

The rest parts of the article proceed as follows. The next section reviews the related previous literature. Section 3 includes the research methodology. Section 4 provides empirical results of the study. The last part highlights the concluding remarks and indicates future research directions.

# 2. Prior Literature

Based on the existing literature on the association between corporate governance and corporate social disclosures, the study considers a total of 12 independent variables for the meta-analysis as follows:

# Independent Variables

# Corporate Governance:

1. 2.1 Board Independence
2. 2.2 Board Size
3. 2.3 Board Gender Diversity
4. 2.4 Frequency of Board Meetings
5. 2.5 Composition of Non-Executive Directors
6. 2.6 CEO Duality
7. 2.7 Auditors’ Credibility
8. 2.8 Diversity of Ownership

# Dependent Variable

Corporate Social Disclosures

# 2.1 Board Independence

Board independence indicates the percentage of independent directors on the board. Agency theory suggests that independent directors pay more attention to the interests of the shareholders at the time of board decision-making process (Fama and Jensen, 1983). Independent directors play a decisive role to dominate over the actions of the board of directors on corporate social responsibility matters (Abdullah et al., 2011). Therefore, independent directors ensure the efficient management of the companies as well as protect the interests of the shareholders (De Andres et al., 2005).

Some empirical examinations investigated the link between the board independence and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Dunn and Sainty, 2009, Ibrahim and Hanefah, 2016, Razak and Mustapha, 2013, Javaid Lone et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014a, Lim et al., 2008, Majeed et al., 2015, Kiliç et al., 2015, Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Deschênes et al., 2015, Supriyono et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Ahmed Haji, 2013). Prior literature finds mixed results. For example, Rashid and Lodh (2008), Dunn and Sainty (2009), Ibrahim and Hanefah (2016), Javaid Lone et al. (2016), Rashid and Lodh (2008), Deschênes et al. (2015), and Supriyono et al. (2015) find a significant positive relation between the board independence and CSD. In contrary, the studies of Razak and Mustapha (2013), Lim et al. (2008), and Nurhayati et al. (2016) show the insignificant positive relation between the board independence and CSD. In addition, some studies find an insignificant negative association between the board independence and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014a, Majeed et al., 2015, Kiliç et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Ahmed Haji, 2013, Barakat et al., 2015).

# 2.2 Board Size

Board size refers to the total number of directors on the company’s board. It considers as an effective monitoring tool of corporate governances (Lee and Chen, 2011). The inter-correlation between board size and reporting is complementary. The larger board size of a company tends to disclose more reporting activities (Samaha et al., 2012). However, a larger board is more efficient than the smaller ones but too larger board is ineffective for monitoring the business operations (Giannarakis, 2014a). It is expected that size of the board shows the management ability and reduce the information lopsidedness of the managers and stakeholders (Chen and Jaggi, 2001, Akhtaruddin et al., 2009). Akhtaruddin et al. (2009) also argue that the greater size of Directors indicates a diversification of expertise on the board because of their collective experience and therefore the disclosures quantity and quality will be higher. The existing literature provides a controversial association between board size and CSD. For example, some academicians find a significant positive relationship between board size and CSD (Javaid Lone et al., 2016, Majeed et al., 2015, Giannarakis, 2013, Supriyono et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Veronica Siregar and Bachtiar, 2010, Ahmed Haji, 2013, Barakat et al., 2015, Giannarakis, 2014b). In contrast, the studies of Razak and Mustapha (2013), Kiliç et al. (2015), Deschênes et al. (2015), and Ling and Sultana (2015) show insignificant and positive impacts of board size on CSD. In addition, Dunn and Sainty (2009), Sufian and Zahan (2013), and Giannarakis (2013) find an insignificant negative relationship.

# 2.3 Board Gender Diversity

It indicates the percentage of women directors on the board. The presence of female directors besides male directors on the board plays a vital role to increase the reputation of the company by engaging with social issues (Bear et al., 2010). Prior literature suggests that women are more sensitive to the society (Burgess and Tharenou, 2002). As a result, they increase board’s focus on CSR related issues (Ayuso and Argandoña, 2009) and charitable giving (Williams, 2003). Hence, it is predicted that there is a positive association between board gender diversity and CSD. But, the prior literature shows inconclusive results. For example, Giannarakis (2014a), Ibrahim and Hanefah (2016), and Javaid Lone et al. (2016) find a significant positive relation between women directors on the board and CSD whereas Majeed et al. (2015) finds a negative and significant association between female directors and CSD. In addition, some authors report that there is an insignificant positive impact of female directors on the CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014a, Khan, 2010, Giannarakis, 2014b), while Kiliç et al. (2015) finds an insignificant negative relationship.

# 2.4 Frequency of Board Meetings

The frequency of board meetings indicates the total number of board meetings which is a proxy of the board activeness to handle organizational issues (Khanchel, 2007). Nowadays, corporate social problems are a crucial matter for the stakeholders. Hence, it is expected that CSR-related topics are discussed at each meeting of the board to protect the interests of the

# 2.5 Composition of Non-Executive Directors (NEDs)

It refers to the percentage of non-executive directors (NEDs) to total directors on the board. The existence of NEDs on the board is crucial because they have the proficiencies and knowledge to judge the issues arise in the meetings (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016). The ability of the NEDs is uncertain regarding governance issues (Myllys, 1999). But, NEDs can supervise to the board of directors when they observe that the act of the executive directors’ against the shareholder's interest (Jensen and Meckling, 1976, Forker, 1992). The empirical literature provides evidence that the diversity of the board of directors enhance corporate social disclosures (Siciliano, 1996). Some studies find a significant positive relationship between NEDs and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Khan, 2010, Lim et al., 2008), whereas Haniffa and Cooke (2005) finds a negative and significant association. In contrast, few studies provide no connection between NEDs and CSD (Haniffa and Cooke, 2002, Cullen and Christopher, 2002).

# 2.6 CEO Duality

CEO duality means the person who serves as a CEO of the company as well as the chairman of the company’s board. Prior literature measures CEO duality by taking a dummy variable equal to one when the same person serves as a CEO as well as the chairman and zero otherwise. CEO duality provides a person strong power in the decision-making process. As a result, the person does not consider the interests of the shareholders so much, and firm social activities including disclosures may be lowered (Haniffa and Cooke, 2002). Therefore, the position of CEO and chairman should be separated as it increases the monitoring quality of the issues relating to stakeholders (Li et al., 2008). However, the previous literature finds inconclusive results on the link between CEO duality and CSD. For example, some studies find a significant negative association between CEO duality and CSD (D.Sundarasen et al., 2016, Giannarakis, 2014b, Ling and Sultana, 2015). In contrary, Razak and Mustapha (2013) and Lim et al. (2008) find an insignificant negative relationship between CEO duality and CSD. In addition, the study of Giannarakis (2014a) provides an evidence of insignificant positive impact of CEO duality on CSD.

# 2.7 Auditors’ Credibility

Auditors’ credibility of any firm indicates its audit quality that is the firm audited by the big audit firm (Big-four). It is predicted that Big-four audit firm conduct their audit activities

sincerely (Owusu-Ansah, 1998) and Big-audit firms increase the credibility of their audited work on the annual reports (Patton and Zelenka, 1997). According to agency theory, auditor plays an effective monitoring tool on the conflict of agent-principal relationship (Lim et al., 2008). Auditors’ credibility such as their suggestions, approval of choosing accounting policies and explanations of vital issues influences on the company’s attitude regarding reporting and disclosure practices (Khan et al., 2013). However, the existing literature shows mixed results on the relationship between auditor’s credibility and CSD. For example, D.Sundarasen et al. (2016) find a significant positive association between auditor’s credibility and CSD. In contrast, Lim et al. (2008) and Lu and Abeysekera (2014) provide evidence of an insignificant positive relationship between auditor’s credibility and CSD. Furthermore, Ling and Sultana (2015), and Alotaibi and Hussainey (2016) find insignificant negative impact of auditors’ credibility on CSD. Prior researchers measure this variable by considering a dummy variable equal to one if a company is audited by one of the Big-four audit firms and zero otherwise.

# 2.8 Diversity of Ownership

# 2.8.1 Government Ownership

Prior literature measures government ownership in different ways. It means the percentage of shares owned by the government (Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Ahmed Haji, 2013, Naser et al., 2006, Suwaidan et al., 2004, Khasharmeh and Suwaidan, 2010). Some of the researchers measure it by taking a dummy variable equal to one if the company is a government company and zero otherwise (Lim et al., 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007, Lu and Abeysekera, 2014). As a government-owned company, it has to aware of the interests of the public and so should disclose more social related activities because government operations are always monitored by the public (Mohd Ghazali, 2007). As government body is politically sensitive and trusted by the people, it has to create more pressure on the companies for disclosing information related to stakeholders (Muttakin and Subramaniam, 2015). Hence, it is predicted that government ownership affects significantly and positively on CSD. But, the previous empirical literature provides mixed results. For example, Suwaidan et al. (2004), Mohd Ghazali (2007), and Lim et al. (2008), Mohd Ghazali (2007) find a significant positive association between government ownership and CSD. Alotaibi and Hussainey (2016) find a significant negative relationship between government ownership and CSD. In contrast, some academicians find that there is a positive and insignificant relationship exists between government ownership and CSD (Ahmed Haji, 2013, Lu and Abeysekera, 2014, Naser et al., 2006, Khasharmeh and Suwaidan, 2010).

# 2.8.2 Foreign Ownership

The greater percentage of foreign ownership of a company indicates more intention to practice foreign rules and regulations (Jeon et al., 2011). Bradbury (1991), and Haniffa and Cooke (2005) argue that stronger foreign ownership creates geographic distance among the owners and so higher level of disclosure expected from the shareholders of the foreign countries. Prior literature measures this variable in two different ways. Some researchers consider the percentage of shares owned by the foreign shareholders for measuring foreign

# 2.8.3 Institutional Ownership

It indicates the percentage of shares owned by the institutional investors. Institutional owners play a fundamental role in changing corporate management behavior (Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Institutional investors treated as majority shareholders and they influence to the management for disclosing more information (Naser et al., 2006). Prior literature shows mixed results. For example, Majeed et al. (2015) find a significant positive relation between institutional ownership and CSD. On the other hand, Li and Zhang (2010) and Nurhayati et al. (2016) find an insignificant positive association between institutional owners and CSD. In addition, Naser et al. (2006), and Rashid and Lodh (2008) provide evidence of an insignificant negative relationship between institutional ownership and CSD.

# 2.8.4 Managerial Ownership

Managerial ownership indicates the percentage of shares owned by the directors. In an owner-managed company, the interests of the outsiders are relatively small, and the disclosures of CSR information may be less (Mohd Ghazali, 2007). Eng and Mak (2003) find that the lower percentage of managerial ownership increases disclosures information. Hence, it is expected that there is a negative relationship between managerial ownership and CSD. Prior literature supports the negative association between managerial ownership and CSD. But, some studies find a significant impact of managerial ownership on CSD (Razak and Mustapha, 2013, Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007), whereas Ahmed Haji (2013), Deschênes et al. (2015), and Supriyono et al. (2015) find an insignificant relationship between managerial ownership and CSD.

# 2.8.5 Concentrated Ownership

Concentrated ownership indicates the possession which occupied by few shareholders or family members (Mohd Ghazali and Weetman, 2006). It is a necessary component of effective corporate governance (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). According to agency theory, the widely dispersed ownership company faces more agency-principal conflicts (Fama and Jensen, 1983). Accordingly, public accountability becomes vital for the widely held companies because these enterprises have a greater chance of being detained by the public as a whole (Mohd Ghazali, 2007) and such companies have to provide substantial social information (Ahmed Haji, 2013). Hence, it is our expectation that concentrated ownership and corporate social disclosures (CSD) express the significant negative relationship. Prior academic literature has scrutinized on the relationship between concentrated ownership and CSD, and the previous results provide controversial findings. For example, Lu and...

Abeysekera (2014) finds a significant negative relationship between concentrated ownership and CSD. In Contrary, Sufian and Zahan (2013), and Majeed et al. (2015) find an insignificant and positive association between concentrated ownership and CSD. In addition, some studies found insignificant and negative impact of concentrated ownership on CSD (Rashid and Lodh, 2008, Mohd Ghazali, 2007, Li and Zhang, 2010, Naser et al., 2006).

# 3. Research Methodology

# 3.1 Sample

For the meta-analysis, the previous 29 studies published ranging from 2004 to 2016 yielding 5437 sample size has considered. All of the articles in the meta-analysis has been collected from the top journal publishers around the world to select the studies which examine the determinants of corporate social disclosures in the context of corporate governance. The study gives importance on the good impact factor journals or books abstracted and indexed by the Thomson Reuters, The Association of Business Schools (ABS), Scopus, and Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) databases. The characteristics of the selected sample studies have shown in Tables 1 & 2.

[Insert Table 1]

[Insert Table 2]

# 3.2 Research Instrument

This study attempts to conduct the meta-analysis technique of Hunter et al. (1982) to reconcile the mixed results of conflicting views of the prior studies. In the current study, the meta-analysis methodology is also a similar nature of other researchers (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990, Rosenthal, 1991, Ahmed and Courtis, 1999, Khlif and Souissi, 2010, Souissi and Khlif, 2012, Eddine et al., 2015, Siddiqui, 2015).

The narrative analysis of the previous literature is not appropriate because the nature of the previous studies vary due to variations of sample size, time, country and other characteristics. Moreover, researchers found different results from various studies (Hunter and Schmidt, 1990). According to Ahmed and Courtis (1999), “Meta-analysis enables to give consistent results and overcome the problems of narrative findings.” Meta-analysis is a statistical technique to reconcile the mixed results of the prior studies (Souissi and Khlif, 2012) and it evaluates the different consequences of the results from the previous studies (García-Meca and Sánchez-Ballesta, 2009). The best definition provided by Glass (1976) as of meta-analysis is a technique by which the findings of the extensive collection of studies accumulated.

In the existing literature of meta-analysis technique, the degree of association between dependent and independent variables are measured using the effect size which is called the coefficient of correlation (r). In this paper, the value of r is calculated for each study sample to measure effect size of each explanatory variable. The value of r is computed based on t-

# 4. Empirical Results

Table 3 summarizes the meta-analysis results of all the explanatory variables. The table shows whether there is any significant or insignificant impact of CG on CSD. In addition, Table 4 to Table 6 explains the subgroups analysis of the studies on the basis of the developed and developing countries (where applicable). The subgrouping analysis assists in removing heterogeneity (Eddine et al., 2015).

[Insert Table 3]

The empirical results have analyzed separately for each variable as follows:

# 4.1 Board Independence

The general meta-analysis results of Table 3 provides an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.086, 95% confidence interval -0.1863; 0.3583) between board independence and CSD using 3620 sample sizes of 17 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The results is similar with Razak and Mustapha (2013), Lim et al. (2008), and Nurhayati et al. (2016). To test the heterogeneity, the chi-square statistic applies here. The chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 88.33) is significant (p < 0.01) which means homogeneity test is rejected. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 19.25% of the observed variance. Therefore, further analysis needed to remove heterogeneity and in Table 4, we split the total studies into developed and developing countries. Both the studies of developed (𝑟 = 0.1737, 95% confidence interval -0.0675; 0.4145) and developing (𝑟 = 0.0698, 95% confidence interval -0.1968; 0.3364) countries indicates an insignificant positive association. The sub-group analysis indicates no effect on the association between board independence and CSD due to the differences of country of study.

[Insert Table 4]

# 4.2 Board Size

Table 3 shows a significant positive association between (𝑟 = 0.1209, 95% confidence interval 0.0425; 0.1993) board size and CSD using 2228 sample sizes of 15 studies. This result is consistent with other researchers, e.g., (Javaid Lone et al., 2016, Majeed et al., 2015, Giannarakis, 2014b, Supriyono et al., 2015, Alotaibi and Hussainey, 2016, Veronica Siregar and Bachtiar, 2010, Barakat et al., 2015). In addition, the chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 18.69) indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 80.25% of the observed variance. As there is no heterogeneity problems, no further analysis needed.

# 4.3 Board Gender Diversity

The overall meta-analysis results on the association between board gender diversity and CSD are presented in Table 3. Using 2081 sample size of 9 studies provide an evidence of an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1039, 95% confidence interval -0.0820; 0.2898). Similar results find by D.Sundarasen et al. (2016), Giannarakis (2014a), Khan (2010), and Giannarakis (2014b). The chi-square statistic applies here to check the heterogeneity. The chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 28.29) is significant (p < 0.01) which means homogeneity test is rejected. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 31.82% of the observed variance. Therefore, we split the total studies into developed and developing countries to remove heterogeneity in Table 5. The studies of developed countries provide significant positive association (𝑟 = 0.0695, 95% confidence interval 0.0107; 0.1283) consistent with Deschênes et al. (2015). In contrast, the studies of developing countries indicate an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1198, 95% confidence interval -0.0940;

# 4.4 Frequency of Board Meetings

The overall meta-analysis results for the frequency of board meetings of Table 3 show a mean correlation (𝑟) of 0.0399 with the 95% confidence interval between 0.0399 and 0.0399 indicates a significant positive association with CSD. The result is inconsistent with other studies. The chi-square statistic (ϰ2k-1 = 2.05) of Table 3 indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 100% of the observed variance. As there is no heterogeneity problem, no further analysis needed.

# 4.5 Composition of Non-Executive Directors

The general meta-analysis results of Table 3 provides an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.0575, 95% confidence interval -0.1865; 0.3015) between composition of non-executive directors and CSD using 1362 sample sizes of 4 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is inconsistent with other studies. The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.

# 4.6 CEO Duality

The general meta-analysis results of Table 3 provides an insignificant negative association (𝑟 = -0.077, 95% confidence interval -0.1994; 0.0454) between CEO duality and CSD using 2130 sample sizes of 7 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. Similar result find by Razak and Mustapha (2013) and Lim et al. (2008). In addition, the chi-square statistic (ϰ2k-1 = 15.53) of Table 3 indicates the existence of heterogeneity. Therefore, the sub-group analysis (Table-6) has divided the studies into developed and developing countries. Both the studies of developed (𝑟 = -0.1092, 95% confidence interval -0.2532; 0.0348) and developing (𝑟 = -0.0654, 95% confidence interval -0.1691; 0.0383) countries indicates an insignificant negative association. The sub-group analysis indicates no effect on the association between CEO duality and CSD due to the differences of country of study.

# 4.7 Auditors’ Credibility

Table 3 shows a significant positive association between (𝑟 = 0.059, 95% confidence interval 0.059; 0.059) auditors’ credibility and CSD using 1564 sample sizes of 5 studies. This result is consistent with D.Sundarasen et al. (2016). In addition, the chi-square statistic value (ϰ2k-1 = 3.75) indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error.

# 4.8 Diversity of Ownership

# 4.8.1 Government Ownership

Table 3 provides an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1724, 95% confidence interval -- 0.0920; 0.4368) between government ownership and CSD using 1332 sample sizes of 8 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is consistent with other studies (Ahmed Haji, 2013, Lu and Abeysekera, 2014, Naser et al., 2006, Khasharmeh and Suwaidan, 2010). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.

# 4.8.2 Foreign Ownership

The meta-analysis results of Table 3 shows an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.1735, 95% confidence interval -0.0439; 0.3909) between foreign ownership and CSD using 326 sample sizes of 4 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is consistent with Sufian and Zahan (2013). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.

# 4.8.3 Institutional Ownership

The general meta-analysis results of Table 3 presents an insignificant positive association (𝑟 = 0.0261, 95% confidence interval -0.0472; 0.0994) between institutional ownership and CSD using 993 sample sizes of 5 studies. The inclusion of zero within the confidence intervals indicates no true correlation, thus, the association shows insignificant. The result is consistent with Li and Zhang (2010) and (Nurhayati et al., 2016). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.

# 4.8.4 Managerial Ownership

The overall meta-analysis results for the managerial ownership of Table 3 show a mean correlation (𝑟) of -0.1289 with the 95% confidence interval between -0.1289 and -0.1289 indicates a significant negative association with CSD. Similar findings find by Razak and Mustapha (2013), Rashid and Lodh (2008), and Mohd Ghazali (2007). The chi-square statistic (ϰ2k-1 = 4.89) of Table 3 indicates acceptance of homogeneity test. At the same time, the sampling error variance accounts for 100% of the observed variance. As there is no heterogeneity problem, no further analysis needed.

# 4.8.5 Concentrated Ownership

The general meta-analysis results of Table 3 identifies a significant negative association (𝑟 = -0.022, 95% confidence interval -0.022; -0.022) between concentrated ownership and CSD using 1165 sample sizes of 7 studies. The result is consistent with Lu and Abeysekera (2014). The subgroup meta-analysis technique is not applied here because all of the studies relating to this variable are the case of developing countries.

# 5. Concluding Remarks and Future Research Directions

The study investigates the impacts of corporate governance (CG) variables on the corporate social disclosures (CSD). Prior studies used meta-analysis technique to determine the determinants of CSD but in different ways. Also, this is the first meta-analytical review on the relationship between CG and CSD. Hence, the study incorporates the result of 29 previous studies on the link between CG and CSD. In the present paper, we include 12 explanatory variables of corporate governance such as board independence, board Size, board gender diversity, the frequency of board meetings, the composition of non-executive directors, CEO duality, auditors’ credibility, government ownership, foreign ownership, institutional ownership, managerial ownership, and concentrated ownership.

The results of the comprehensive meta-analysis found that board Size, the frequency of board meetings, and auditors’ credibility are significantly and positively associated with CSD. Both the managerial and concentrated ownership are also a significant but negative association with CSD. In contrast, board independence, board gender diversity, the composition of non-executive directors, government ownership, foreign ownership, and institutional ownership are insignificantly and positively associated with CSD. CEO duality also insignificant with CSD but indicates a negative association. The study also uses the sub-grouping analysis based on country differences. The findings indicate that only the association between board gender diversity and CSD affected by the differences of the country of study. The association reveals significant positive for the developed countries but insignificant positive for the developing countries.

Although this study is the first meta-analytical review for examining the impact of CG on CSD, the study faces limitations as well. It excludes the various corporate characteristics as determinants of CSD. Therefore, further study should investigate by considering all of the variables besides CG like firm size, leverage, profitability, firm age, industry type, etc. Regardless of these limitations, we predict that the empirical findings of this study will be beneficial for the future researcher to develop the theory on the link between CG and CSD.

# Abstract

Organizations have been showing a growing awareness regarding the importance of corporate sustainability. However, the integration of sustainability concerns in companies' long-term planning, strategic management, processes, and activities is still challenging, disconnected, and often conducted in isolation. Based on a qualitative exploratory research combining different perspectives found in the literature, the present research presents a theoretical framework that is expected to enhance the adequate development and management of organizational sustainability-oriented practices — the Integrative Sustainable Intelligence model. This model provides organizational managers with a structured framework to adequately understand, select, implement and assess sustainability promoting actions, based on the development of structural and systematic disruptive tools and involving the exchange of collaborative ideas between organizational stakeholders. The adoption of the Integrative Sustainable Intelligence model is expected to foster change processes and innovations in the search for solutions for sustainability-oriented business models.

The last five decades have witnessed a growing concern and a broad and important discussion regarding the impact of unsustainable practices. Scholars, professionals, and even common citizens are highly aware of the need to study and change behaviours (Rockstrom et al., 2009). Figure 1 shows main approaches and contributions regarding the implementation of the necessary changes towards sustainability and well-being.

Concerned about the importance of adequately understanding the consequences of human development, the implications of its impacts and the problems caused by a changing lifestyle, the United Nations (UN), during its Conference on the Human Environment in 1972 (UN, 1972), introduced the principles that would later support the concept of sustainable development1 (SD). This concept would become a sociopolitical, economic, and environmental objective, ratified by the Brundtland Commission in the document entitled “Our Common Future” (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987). Based on this work, Elkington suggests the understanding of sustainability through a three-dimensional vision, known as “triple bottom line” (TBL) (Elkington, 1999). Sustainability will be achieved through the adequate balance, in each moment, of the economic capital and its profitability, the environmental capital and its preservation, and the social capital and its equity (Jerónimo Silvestre, Antunes, & Filho, 2014).

The definition of SD proposed in the Brundtland report is simple and attractive and has inspired different definitions for corporate sustainability (CS) — namely, the one developed by Dyllick and Hockerts (Dyllick & Hockerts, 2002) and the one developed by Bansal (Bansal, 2005). However, all these definitions have the disadvantage of being vague, which hinders their adequate understanding and operationalization (Lankoski, 2016; Poddar, Narula, & Zutshi, 2019). Therefore, organizations face

considerable challenges to attend to different stakeholders expectations and to adapt to the different socioeconomic and environmental-economic dynamics (Ostrom, 2009).

In spite of these difficulties, an increasing number of organizations are recognizing the importance of sustainability dimensions and are demonstrating their commitment to sustainability through the integration of this concept in their strategies and management models (Armindo, Fonseca, Abreu, & Toldy, 2019; Stubbs, 2019). According to recent studies, in most cases, the implementation of these strategies has been more superficial than effective, consisting of little more than a response to stakeholders pressures regarding responsible business performances (Schrettle, Hinz, Scherrer -Rathje, & Friedli, 2014). Therefore, it is still very important to continue studying the relation between organizational commitment towards sustainability and its effective implementation and performance.

This scenario leads to the need of developing new proposals aiming the orientation and promotion of organizational involvement with sustainability, leading to the reformulation of organizational behaviours. In this scope, the General Assembly of the UN has defined, in 2015, a new agenda for SD based on 17 principles that led to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), defending that sustainable production and consumption should be widely adopted by 2030 (UN, 2015).

For this transformation to take place, organizations need to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to promote SD (Dyllick & Hockerts, 2002; UN, 2015) and to adequately understand the mechanisms and interactions needed to integrate improved performances for the organization with improved performances for the environment and also for the different organizational stakeholders (Hörisch, Freeman, & Schaltegger, 2014). This implies the construction of a proactive organizational culture, which will determine how sustainability will be thought, acted, and experienced (Baumgartner, 2014), leading top management towards the adequate understanding of which initiatives should be developed, by whom and for what reason (Manning, Braam, & Reimsbach, 2019).

The will to implement sustainability practices should be clearly expressed in organizational strategies, namely, through the economic perspective of the social and environmental dimensions, the mitigation of negative environmental impacts caused by the organization's activities, and the creation of tangible value and benefits for society in the short, medium, and long term (Aarseth, Ahola, Aaltonen, Økland, & Andersen, 2017). To achieve this, the business model should reflect its strategic will to balance the TBL (Stubbs, 2019). All these issues must be assessed through a systematic process that measures the adequacy of the organization's use of resources and of the implemented actions to improve TBL balance (Montiel & Delgado-Ceballos, 2014).

Finally, it is through reporting that organizations disclose their intentions, progresses, results, and future perspectives (Maas, Schaltegger, & Crutzen, 2016). Organizations worldwide are increasingly including in sustainability reports information regarding their contribution to the SDGs (Fonseca & Carvalho, 2019; Poddar et al., 2019; Rosati & Faria, 2019). However, this practice of publicly disclosing information on how an organization is addressing the SDGs is still limited to larger organizations (Rosati & Faria, 2019), to organizations with a higher environmental footprint (Poddar et al., 2019), and to organizations with higher commitment to sustainability frameworks, like the UN Global Compact (Fonseca &

# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA

Carvalho, 2019; Rosati & Faria, 2019). As can be noted, the progress towards sustainability is not simple. It is recognized by specialists that the change from a conventional style to a sustainability approach causes several organizational transformations, some of them having profound implications. These transformations are influenced by diverse barriers, drivers, and internal and external key factors that will determine the success or failure of the organizational transition to a sustainability-oriented pathway (Asswad, Hake, & Marx Gómez, 2016).

Pain reinforces this idea by acknowledging that most of the approaches and organizational models were not able to lead to a systemic thinking of integrative actions towards sustainability, due, at least in part, to the inability of organizational thinking to integrate and balance sustainability dimensions (Pain, 2014). Other studies refer the non-existence of a single integration model that allows organizations to implement sustainability practices in their daily activities and in their medium and long-term strategies, using simple and conventional management procedures (Maas et al., 2016; Morioka & de Carvalho, 2016; Rosati & Faria, 2019).

The study described in this paper was based on a qualitative exploratory research, combining different perspectives found in a structured literature review, and aims to explore a differentiating approach regarding the dynamization and integration of sustainability in organizational context. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to propose methodologies to drive organizations towards the development of structural and systematic disruptive tools in order to materialize their intentions regarding sustainability issues. For this, a framework for sustainability management will be developed, designated as Integrative Sustainable Intelligence (ISI). This framework is expected to provide organizational managers with a structural model that leads to a logical pathway between the development, implementation, assessment, and correction of sustainability-oriented activities.

The main contributions of this research are the following: (a) the development of the ISI framework; (b) the development of a simple approach, structured in functional steps, which allows managers to question the pathway towards organizational sustainability; (c) the understanding of sustainability through a holistic and transversal approach, which is expected to help organizations in the strategic decision-making process regarding the operationalization of CS.

Also, the development of the ISI model, presented in this paper, is expected to provide a theoretical contribution to the subject of organizational sustainability management, enhancing future empirical research projects focusing this model's impacts and relevance and thus contributing to its continuous refinement.

# BACKGROUND

The acknowledgement that the present trends regarding production and consumption are unbearable is patent in several scenarios (Costanza et al., 2014) and has led to the understanding of the importance and irreparability of functions and values that are being lost in the natural and social environments, many of which are critical for the adequate operation and balance of different systems.

Some signs are promising counteracts of the present degradation, namely, planet's decarbonization initiatives (Rockström et al., 2017), the UN agenda for SD (UN, 2015), and the clear pressure that stakeholders are exerting on the activities of organizations (Govindan, 2018).

All these reasons motivate organizations to dedicate more attention to the mitigation of negative impacts caused by their activities (Michelon, Boesso, & Kumar, 2013). Nevertheless, it is recognized that there are difficulties in adequately operationalizing organizational sustainability into activities that can be understandable, functional, and quantified (Kyaw, Olugbode, & Petracci, 2017; Lankoski, 2016). This leads organizations to invest in sustainability by mere institutional reaction to stakeholder pressures, without an adequate intelligence approach. Therefore, the actions and behaviours triggered are frequently unrelated with the impacts that should be addressed (Porter & Kramer, 2006) and compromise the effectiveness of innovative actions and opportunities, as well as competitive advantages and value co-creation (Aquilani, Silvestri, Ioppolo, & Ruggieri, 2018).

More important than understanding the impact of sustainability factors, the major challenge faced by organizations, of any size and activity sector, is the lack of transversal knowledge regarding the impacts of their activities, which would allow the adequate understanding of how to integrate sustainability in their daily practices (Shields & Shelleman, 2015). The results of Kiron et al., obtained in a research study focusing large companies, show that 90% of executives perceive sustainability as something important, but only 60% were able to identify sustainability strategies (Kiron et al., 2017).

Many strategies were developed with the aim to overcome this gap between sustainability intentions and sustainability practices, as referred by Bonini and Bové (2014), for example, extension of the scope of products life cycle, organizational strategy focused on sustainability, encouragement of open, honest, and transparent internal dialogues regarding sustainability efforts, support given to innovation, creativity, and initiative regarding sustainability issues (Bonini & Bové, 2014). In this scope, the voluntary implementation of integrated management systems (e.g., quality management, environmental management, and health and safety management) can be a relevant contribution to enhance sustainability-oriented practices. Several research studies have established a connection between the implementation of management systems and improvements in organizational sustainability (e.g., Qi, 2013; Gianni, Gotzamani, & Tsiotras, 2017; Testa, Boiral, & Heras-Saizarbitoria, 2018; Para-González & Mascaraque-Ramírez, 2019) because they share the focus on the relationship with different stakeholders — clients, competitors, and suppliers (quality management), communities and ecosystems (environmental management), and employees (health and safety management). Several authors agree that the integration of sustainability in organizations daily practices is imperative for its adequate development, namely, because of the following: (a) it improves competitivity and general well-being (Scherrer, Daub, & Burger, 2007); (b) it appeals to a holistic vision of the different sustainability dimensions (Lozano, 2015); (c) it allows the typifying of organizations actions and activities (Jerónimo Silvestre, Antunes, & Leal Filho, 2016); (d) it is a relevant part of organizational strategic planning (Baumgartner & Rauter, 2017); and (e) it acts as a conceptual structure in the decision-making processes (Bonn & Fisher, 2011).

# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA

Engert, Rauter, and Baumgartner (2016) refer that the proposals developed regarding sustainability integration processes only focus very specific questions, and in spite of the growing interest on these issues, theoretical contributions do not comprise intuitive approaches with practical implementation tools. These authors appeal that “future research should move from focusing on whether or not companies need to integrate corporate sustainability into strategic management to how this could be done in practice” (Engert et al., 2016; p. 2843).

In this scope, the model developed by Mass et al. (2016) must be referred: It considers three factors based on the quantification, management, and communication, through inside-out/outside-in perspectives of analysis (Maas et al., 2016). Another relevant contribution is the model developed by Morioka and de Carvalho (2016), based on organization's performance and considering four factors: processes and practices, skills, proposals, and contributions for the development of competitive advantages (Morioka & de Carvalho, 2016).

A possible explanation regarding why organizational sustainability models do not define the operationalization of sustainability integration is the implicit complexity of its implementation. In order to successfully integrate sustainability in its daily practices, an organization must perform a deep reflection regarding the conception of sustainability that is more suited with its organizational culture, which will have to be reflected on its strategic and operative sustainability management (Lankoski, 2016).

Ortiz-Avram et al. state the need of research studies aiming to increase knowledge and consolidate the notion of integrated sustainability (IS) focusing (a) connections and ethical values, (b) performance in the long term, (c) formal processes to develop IS, and (d) good-practice policies (Ortiz-Avram, Domnanovich, Kronenberg, & Scholz, 2018).

Several authors agree that the necessary change regarding sustainability integration processes is provided by transformation skills resulting from organizational culture (Linnenluecke & Griffiths, 2010), because it is this organizational culture that enables the consolidation and understanding of organizational sustainability goals.

On the other hand, it is recognized that different factors can motivate organizational changing processes and enable the understanding of how organizations integrate and promote interactions of sustainability issues in the different TBL dimensions. The organizational impacts of these factors vary whether they are internal or external, specific or transversal (Lozano, 2015). Examples of internal factors commonly refer leadership, strategies, culture, environmental precaution, risk mitigation, and transparency; as external factors, it is common to see negative publicity, stakeholders pressures, regulations and legislation, and the rising of general social awareness (Lozano & von Haartman, 2018). All these factors are dynamic and depend on the organization's size, structure, and activity sector (Engert & Baumgartner, 2016).

For organizations that have successfully IS issues, sustainability management demands the verification of the scope and impact of organizational changes, as well as the assessment of how the organization is effectively handling its processes and interacting with relevant stakeholders (Doppelt, 2010). For these purposes, it is important to identify not only key internal or external factors but also transversal key factors, common to other organizations. This allows the contextual understanding of possible interactivities between awareness, implementation, measurement, and communication processes, promoting facilitating activities in order to overcome sustainability barriers.

Previous research on these issues highlights the need to develop management models with ability to integrate CS and therefore to enable value co-creation dynamics (Aquilani et al., 2018). The lack of sustainability intelligence leads to reactive and mechanical responses to stakeholder pressures. The absence of a critical and strategical analysis of possible approaches increases the risk of uncertainties regarding possible actions to implement, which hinder the effective integration of sustainability and its associated benefits. Consequently, organizational impact of sustainability-oriented actions is not recognized as “expansion of wealth-welfare-well-being all around” by adopting a “win more–win more” approach, as referred by (Ramaswamy & Ozcan, 2014; p. 31).

Based on literature, the present research assumes organizations as non-homogeneous entities, characterized and differentiated by specific dynamics. Their understanding and operationalization of the ISI will define a framework that reflects their perception degree on different factors.

# 2.1 Business models for sustainability

The study of business models has an increasing relevance in CS management. Business models provide a systematic analysis and perspective on how an organization operates and does its businesses, enabling the adequate delineation, observation, implementation, and modification of practices and procedures in different strategic and operational stages (Zott, Amit et al. 2011; Muñoz-Torres, Fernández-Izquierdo, Rivera-Lirio, & Escrig-Olmedo, 2019).

Business models can be defined as “value propositions” that an organization presents to its customers, reflecting the methodologies used to manage its resources in order to create and sustain value over time (Muñoz-Torres et al., 2019).

Literature review shows different approaches and typologies regarding business models, applied to different sectors and economic activities. However, the inclusion of social and environmental dimensions in the study of business models has only taken place recently (Geissdoerfer, Vladimirova, & Evans, 2018).

The adoption and transformation of business models in the context of organizational sustainability depend on the organization's objectives regarding the TBL dimensions (Schaltegger, Lüdeke-Freund, & Hansen, 2016). Organizations have different value propositions with different levels of objectives, which implies the existence of different structural business models (Demil & Lecocq, 2010). Therefore, business models must be aligned with the global strategic objectives defined by the organization.

Sustainable business models should be considered under the scope of a dynamic and permanent interaction system requiring the intervention of multiple stakeholders and the use of diverse resources to develop and provide products and services, taking into account the adequate balance and equity of the TBL dimensions (DaSilva & Trkman, 2014; Zott, Amit, & Massa, 2011).

# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA

The context in which organizations operate is not stable, with frequent changes and uncertainties that cannot be completely controlled (Ragsdell, 2000). Organizations promote initiatives involving autonomous measures, promoting synergies and/or complementarities, which will lead to different results and impacts depending on the specific issues under consideration (Jerónimo Silvestre, Antunes, Amaro, & Leal Filho, 2015). This indicates that there is no unique or best answer regarding CS but rather a converging view to a given outcome (Rauter, Jonker, & Baumgartner, 2017).

The focus nowadays is not the product itself but rather a whole set of functional services associated with it, composing its life cycle. The organizational understanding of this cycle (including its economic, environmental, and social impacts) inevitably conditions stakeholder perceptions regarding value propositions, value creation, and value capture and is essential for the adequate organizational orientation towards sustainability.

This study was based on exploratory qualitative research methodology, which is adequate for the development of new explanations regarding how different factors relate with each other, enhancing new approaches and theories regarding a specific segment of reality (Creswell, 2003; Reiter, 2017).

The research study was planned and structured in two stages: literature review on different constructs related with CS management, through systematic and reproducible procedures (Littell, Corcoran, & Pillai, 2008) and the use of the grounded theory (GT) for the generation of new theoretical insights (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). These methodological processes are illustrated in Figure 2.

# 3.1 | Literature review

A structured literature review was performed in two different steps: (a) planning and (b) optimization (Tranfield, Denyer, & Smart, 2003). It started with an exploratory search for articles on the Thomson Reuters, Web of Science and Elsevier Scopus databases, published between 2008 and 2019, focusing the topics TBL, sustainability integration, CS, intelligence, and value co-creation. A total of 570 papers were found, which were divided in different categories in order to enable the perception of the initial scope of the research field (Creswell, 2003). A refinement selection was then performed, excluding those articles that did not focus directly the research topic. A total of 120 papers remained at this stage, focusing the integration of organizational sustainability and organizational sustainability practices. These papers were then subject to content analysis (Berg, 2009) in order to provide data to feed the GT methodology.

# 3.2 | Grounded theory

GT is a methodology developed by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss regarding qualitative research, explicitly focused on the generation of new theoretical insights based on systematic strategic processes of information collection and analysis (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). By the identification of causal connections in specific contexts, GT enhances non-linear integral approaches to understand the multifaceted dynamics of complex systems (Charmaz, 2006).

GT was developed as a response to the gap existing between theoretical and qualitative empirical research, given the predominance of quantitative methodologies in social science studies (Gibbons et al., 1994; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Jupp, 2006). Through GT, it is possible to use exploratory research in the development of models aiming to study different social contexts, even if the researcher has little control over the studied phenomena. GT emphasizes strategic approaches in the development and construction of theory from data (Foley & Timonen, 2015; Jupp, 2006).

In qualitative data analysis, Glaser and Strauss (1967) refer that the phenomenon can be explained through an inductive approach, a deductive approach, or a combination of both. Deductive research is based on the absence of predetermined theories to guide information and data collection. Inductive research is associated with interpretative approaches, allowing the researcher to use subjective reasoning based on real experiences (Ridenour & Newman, 2008).

# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA

Strauss (1967), research can generate either formal or substantive theories. Formal theory is developed in a broad scope research area, whereas substantive theory provides interpretation to a delimited problem in a particular area (Charmaz, 2006).

The present research study develops its research objectives through formal theory. GT will be used to explore how predictive management can enhance IS solutions leading to more sustainable business models. Based on contributions that enhance the dynamics and causal connections between sustainability and its integration in business plans, information gathered in the literature review will be used to develop an integrated, delimited, and universal theory regarding the research problem, giving analytic/inductive support to the research. GT methodology enhances the understanding of the meaning of data in several circumstances and therefore uses evidence to propose concepts by studying and examining information through successive levels of analysis (Charmaz, 2006). The concept this research aims to propose is a framework focusing organizational sustainability management, designated as ISI, described in the following sections.

# 4 | INTEGRATIVE SUSTAINABLE INTELLIGENCE

Corley and Gioia identified two requirements to achieve a theoretical contribution: originality, obtained by exercising a different point of view and usefulness, obtained by contributing to a broader understanding of the research subject (Corley & Gioia, 2011). The framework ISI proposes an alternative management model for CS, which complies with both requirements referred above: It provides new dynamics and understanding regarding organizational change through the adaptation of alternatives and considers different requirements and methodologies to foster the transition to a sustainability-oriented model. The usefulness of this framework is obtained through the development of a new concept that contributes in practice for the understanding and enhancement of organizational transition for sustainable management models.

The transition from economic models, focused on profit maximization, to models aiming the conciliation of economic, social, and environmental values, can be achieved either through small evolutive changes and/or radical change processes (Carroll & Shabana, 2010). Changes represent opportunities, which must be anticipated, prepared, and managed. Ignoring the need to implement the required changes implies not responding to new challenges and opportunities, with consequent losses at the economic, social, and environmental levels. ISI framework, described in the following sections, aims to contribute with a new insight regarding organizational change in the transition towards sustainability.

commitments, and behaviours. This adaptation should be based on a set of transversal or specific factors that produce the necessary information to adequately manage the planned sustainability dimensions.

“Integrative” is understood as the capacity to align different operational and functional factors to enable the connection needed to achieve the intended organizational goal, which will define the extension and scope of the integration required (Iraldo, Testa, & Frey, 2009; Oertwig et al., 2017).

“Organizational sustainability” is understood as the search for ideal dynamic states regarding TBL dimensions, based on the principles of precaution, interdependency and connections, efficiency and assessment, and integrity and equity. This search enables the development of skills that will enhance organizational evolution to new levels of assurance, balance, and healthy maintenance of the different systems and subsystems relevant for CS (Costanza & Daly, 1992; Jerónimo Silvestre et al., 2014; Lamberton, 2005).

“Intelligence” is based on the concept developed by Moratis and Melissem (Moratis & Melissen, 2019) consisting of three different levels: (a) naive intelligence, (b) native intelligence, and (c) narrative intelligence. This concept is complemented with the approach of Daniel Goleman that defends different patterns of intelligence directly related with self-conscience, impulse control, persistence, enthusiasm, empathy, self-motivation, and social skills (Goleman, 1995).

Therefore, “intelligence” is understood as the capacity to learn from experience and to provide rational, emotional, social, and ecologic responses in the scope of the present context and environment (Goleman, 2010; Moratis & Melissen, 2019).

In this sense, ISI translates the ability of organizations and stakeholders to apply knowledge and experience in the contexts affected by organizational impacts, enhancing alternative proposals, solutions, and proactive behaviours. These are expected to contribute to global sustainability, considering both the perspective of supply and demand/consumption.

# 4.2 | ISI framework development

ISI framework aims to allow its users to create and develop alternatives regarding the management of uncertainties in sustainability-oriented measures, enabling the implementation of adequate control systems regarding input and output variables and indicators. ISI is expected to provide a structured, dynamic, and integrated contribution for the organizational management of alternatives regarding the achievement of a rational functional change in the scope of CS, enhancing creative converging solutions. Figure 3 shows the ISI framework structured in four phases: (a) discover; (b) create and add value; (c) value co-creation; and (d) act and consolidate. All these phases are flexible and complement each other.

# 4.1 | Model conceptualization

# 4.2.1 | Discover

ISI is defined as the material, technical, managerial, and leadership skills that an organization requires, in each moment, regarding the adaptation of its resources, emotions, motivations, expectations, knowledge required to clarify a given situation or problem, which is...

# Integrative Sustainable Intelligence framework

meant to be solved or anticipated. Time spent in this stage is directly related with the required level of precision, the scope of the problem and its complexity level, the extent of the objectives, and its expected impacts. Two stages compose the “discover” phase: data and acknowledgement.

# Data

Data are knowledge, defined as the set of structured, unstructured, and semistructured information obtained from heterogeneous sources (Sherman, 2015). In data analysis processes, the “What, Why, When, and How” set of questions is crucial to enable value creation, given its contribution to adequately understand the reality and context of the situation/problem under analysis (Verhoef, Kooge, & Walk, 2016).

The collected information should represent knowledge, should be materially important and should contribute to the understanding of the problem. On the other hand, it should enable the definition of solutions regarding the adequate procedures and behaviours that will enable the delivery of the right products and services, to the right client, on the right time and at the right amount, causing the least possible negative impact and promoting the highest possible positive impact. All these dimensions should be integrated in a business model that enables the re-assessment of procedures, behaviours, products and services, according to individual, social, environmental and economic needs, with the aim of sustainable value creation.

# Acknowledgement

In the search for maintaining competitive and resilient processes, it is critical for organizations to adequately deal with and understand the available information, given the constant evolution and volatility of conditions and the unpredictability of the contexts in which they act.

In this scope, it is consensual among specialists that organizations need to develop and create skills and mechanisms for fast adaptation, flexibility and innovation, in order to timely recognize and adapt to a changing context (Kok & Driessen, 2012). Possible negative impacts and consequences will be reduced if organizations adequately and timely identify the need to implement changes.

Klarner, Probst, and Soparnot (2008) define organizational change capacity as “an organization's ability to develop and implement appropriate organizational changes to constantly adapt to its environment” (Klarner et al., 2008; p. 58). According to these authors, change is not an isolated event because multiple changes occur over time. Therefore, change capacity is a “dynamic capability” that comprises not only the organizational process of continuous learning and adjustment but also the organizational capacity to implement the necessary changes (Klarner et al., 2008).

In this step of the ISI framework, the knowledge obtained through data collection and analysis is expected to enhance the generation of ideas and proposals regarding the recognition of problems to be solved, calling upon internal and external stakeholders. The generation of ideas is developed through design and dynamic thinking processes and solution proposals should flow naturally without categorization. The scope of the problem will enhance the survival of the proposals with the highest degrees of consistency and potential, which will be naturally encouraged. The solidity of the selected proposals will depend on the predefined criteria of acceptance and of the incremental dynamics created for the required change. This dynamics will depend on stakeholders behaviours and also on organizational leadership, governance and culture (Judge, Naoumova, & Douglas, 2009). At the end of this phase, several solutions should be under consideration for the next steps.

# 4.2.2 | Create and add value

It is consensual that organizations have the core purpose of creating value. As referred by the International Integrated Reporting Council, “value created by an organization over time manifests itself in increases, decreases or transformations of the capitals caused by the organization's business activities and outputs” (International Integrated Reporting Council, 2013; p. 10). A central issue in discussions regarding value creation is the context in which value is created: time, place and stakeholders involved will be determinant for the effective understanding of value creation (Vargo, Maglio, & Akaka, 2008). There are many possible definitions of value, including value-in-use and value-in-exchange (Vargo, Maglio et al. 2008), and no consensus exists regarding the effective contribution of the different value-creation components.

In this phase of ISI model, organizations are expected to understand their responsibility regarding the need to create value in different contexts of social and environmental capitals, without questioning the dynamics of the economic value. The organization's understanding regarding these issues will result either in the expansion or in the reduction of efforts and investments in the different dimensions of organizational value. Adequate organizational capacity to create materially responsible value in these dimensions is of major importance because it will impact all stakeholders.

# Develop

The proposals and new ideas identified in the previous stages must be analysed, and decisions must be taken regarding the viability of their implementation. The purpose is to draw and develop a model allowing the materialization of the proposals under analysis, including the definition of priorities, the identification of necessary and available resources and the understanding of all implications associated with the proposal's implementation. The need for modification in case of new insights (e.g., new information or new technological options) should also be considered.

This process is expected to enhance the development of a possible solution for the problem under analysis, through a functional and iterative process that should be adequately planned, assessed and whenever necessary, readjusted, in order to broaden value creation opportunities.

A critical factor in this “develop” stage is the adequate promotion of interactions that will foster the transformation of intangible experiences into tangible ones. This can affect channel selection processes, with potential market implications, enhancing innovation procedures and improvements in organizational efficacy and resulting in organizational differentiation and improved competitiveness.

# Transform

This stage is expected to promote change through the synergistic effects of the adaptability and learning capacities enhanced in the previous stages. These new organizational skills will stimulate new behaviours. It is expected that the development of new solutions, materialized in innovative behaviours, products, and services, will provide answers to specific problems and market needs.

Those who are responsible for organizational strategy should be able to recognize their limitations regarding the knowledge of all the answers to the different problems. Two approaches can be used to overcome this limitation: one directly connected with organizational operations, considering employee motivation, participation and recognition — social capital — specially focusing those who are in the middle or bottom of the organizational pyramid (sustainability operatives); another approach is to foster the participation of a broad scope of stakeholders in the search for answers, enabling the continuous collection of ideas, opinions and suggestions, which will enhance alternative solutions to both specific and more generalized problems. This plural approach should be seen as an intangible asset in the search for solutions (Freeman, Harrison, Wicks, Parmar, & Colle, 2010).

The transformation process should be structuralist, multi-dimensional and multidirectional and should promote organizational transformations at different levels — including systems, procedures and behaviours — transferring its actions to different contexts and stakeholders. This process must consider historical and contextual considerations that underlie transformations, such as technological changes in products and services that have shaped social, economic and environmental habits and contexts over time.

This organizational transformative vision is expected to create the basis for new scenarios and forecasts. This will enable the development and implementation of visionary strategies to change future habits and practices.

# 4.2.3 | Value co-creation

The “value co-creation” stage aims the management of the planned change through a participative process, in which the organization and its stakeholders are included and through which knowledge is generated and transferred. Because the value incorporated in a product or service is defined by its use (value-in-use) and not by its cost (value-in-exchange), the determination of the incorporated value is up to the final user (Vargo & Lusch, 2008).

As referred by Saarijärvi et al. (2013), it is crucial to adequately identify and understand “what kind of value is cocreated for whom, using what resources, and through what mechanism” Saarijärvi, Kannan & Kuusela, 2013. The amount of value co-created, as well as its perception, depends on the specific circumstances and actors present in this interaction, namely, the organization, its clients, business partners and society. This interaction may occur in different forms: business to consumer, business to business, business to governance or business to employee.

and enhance innovative performances throughout the organization. This stage of the ISI framework deals with the interactivity of the knowledge generated in the scope of the new ideas and interactions impacting and influencing the surrounding environments.

with stakeholders, achieved in the previous stages. The established interchange is a semiotic relationship between the form and the content of the solutions to be implemented. This transfer is materialized through information interchange and knowledge communication between the organization and its internal and external stakeholders (Agle, Donaldson, & Freeman, 2008). The desired effect is the production of impacts between the different actors, which can be either positive or negative, and will vary in intensity and direction.

The transfer process is characterized by a high level of complexity regarding interactivity promotion either inside the organization and between the organization and its surrounding environments (Minbaeva, 2007; Spraggon & Bodolica, 2012). This is mostly given to the non-linearity of the relationship process established between the understanding and acknowledgement of the positive and negative consequences and of the strategic position that the organization should adopt in face of this problem to effectively and efficiently achieve the aimed impact.

# II. Synergistic solutions:

This option will enhance higher collective performance levels when compared with individual actions. Therefore, the adoption of solutions with multiple associated factors will result in improved impacts in the process of problem solving.

# III. Complementarity solutions:

The different solutions have a supportive effect and will complement each other in the contribution to problem solving.

# Anticipate

organization, as knowledge holder and the stakeholders, as knowledge users (Wood, 2010). The knowledge transfer process will therefore condition the stakeholder's use of this knowledge. Knowledge transfer is achieved through the use of relational networks established between all interacting parts in this process that share culture, history, language, political and social institutions (Beck, 2002). Antecipatory actions like imagining, designing, modeling, and simulating, are demonstrations of attempts to conquer a favorable position in the face of a not yet present condition that is called “future.”

Organizations are recognized to live and compete in a world with economic, social, and environmental interconnections and therefore have difficulties in independently resisting, or trying to resist, to unexpected events although maintaining a competitive position. The capacity to resist and respond to external and internal events and recover from them is called “resilience” (Rose & Krausmann, 2013). However, not all organizations are able to overcome and successfully adapt to these events, which are occurring with increasing frequency, diversification and associated challenges.

# 4.2.4 | Act and consolidate

The expression “the future is now” raises a series of questions regarding what kind of actions should be assumed and developed, which is the most adequate time frame, and what are the potential management risks and impacts in social, environmental and economic dimensions. The knowledge acquired in the previous stages is an important basis to adequately act and predict impacts and consequences.

This last phase of the ISI framework deals with the implementation of the selected actions and the assessment of their impacts, enabling the organization to assume a consolidated position in problem anticipation and solving and enhancing new discoveries and new processes.

# Solutions

In the previous stages, choices have been made, and consequently interrelations have been established between different actors, in the scope of a specific problem that needs to be solved. The results obtained lead to three possible types of solutions, with different impacts for the organization and its stakeholders:

# I. Compromise solutions (“trade-offs”):

Some factors have been compromised to favour other factors. This option requires a complete

# 5 | CONCLUSIONS

The ISI framework proposed in this research is oriented to the analysis, understanding, enhancement and implementation of proposals with impact on CS. This framework's design was based on a qualitative exploratory research combining different perspectives found in the literature.

# SILVESTRE AND FONSECA

The main contribution of the present research was the development of a guide to how organizations can systematically understand, select, implement and assess the sustainability they want to practice, enabling a holistic approach that can lead to the solution of specific problems and prevent potential negative impacts in the future. The proposed model is based on a flexible and circular approach, that enhances organizational skills regarding sustainability-oriented problem solving.

The ISI framework aims to link the “why” arising from a specific problem with the “how” conducting to the problem's solution, enhancing change and adaptation skills. This process should be built on the creative skills of the different actors in the different stages of the solution seeking process, thus promoting the analysis of how different choices may impact organizational sustainability.

The model developed in this research can be used in a non-linear implementation process, because its different parts and stages may be individually implemented to identify and analyse specific issues, either in a preanalysis stage or in the development of action plans.

A key factor in the ISI framework is its ability to foster the exchange of collaborative ideas between different stakeholders, enhancing change processes and innovative approaches in the development of products, services and solutions oriented towards sustainability business models.

The research presented in this paper has the inherent limitation of theoretical explorative studies — it is not supported on empirical evidence, and the interpretation of information is influenced by the authors' perspective. Therefore, empirical research regarding the operationalization of the ISI framework in real-case scenarios is essential to validate this theoretical model. As future works, an empirical research is being developed with the aim to identify internal, external and transversal key factors that will contribute to success in the different stages of the ISI framework and to analyse its impacts in different scenarios. It is our expectation that this new approach regarding decision-making oriented to CS may enhance future research works aiming the continuous refinement of the proposed model and its validation through empirical research.

Despite the tremendous number of publications concerned with the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP), inconsistent empirical findings persist and the overall picture remains vague. Drawing on a hybrid theoretical framework (combining the theoretical reasoning of the natural-resource-based view (NRBV) with instrumental stakeholder and slack resources arguments), we address the apparent lack of consensus by meta-analytically integrating the findings of 149 studies. We pay particular attention to two highly material issues: the direction of causality and the multidimensionality of the focal constructs. Meta-analytic results indicate that there is a positive and partially bidirectional relationship between CEP and CFP. In addition, our findings suggest that the relationship is stronger when the strategic approach underlying CEP is proactive rather than reactive. Furthermore, we reveal moderation effects of methodological artifacts, which may provide explanations for the inconsistency of the results of previous studies. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications and outline avenues for further research.

# Introduction

“While the question of whether it pays to be green has probably generated more research pages than any other single question, the answer remains unresolved” (Hoffman & Bansal, 2012, p. 14).

“Science advances when scholars reach consensus about the conclusions offered by a body of evidence, and meta-analysis is our best methodology for reaching consensus” (Combs, Ketchen, Crook, & Roth, 2011, p. 194).

The relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) constitutes one of the most puzzling phenomena pertaining to research on organizations and the natural environment. Insofar as scholars have tackled environmental issues, the discovery of the link between CEP and CFP has evolved into something similar to finding the “holy grail” (Boons & Wagner, 2009; Peloza, 2009). Over the last four decades, myriad studies have sought to identify the relationship between these performance constructs. In this context, one of the most fundamental issues shaping research on the focal relationship refers to the direction of causality (i.e., whether CEP influences CFP, whether CFP influences CEP, or whether there is a bidirectional relationship) (e.g., Ambec & Lanoie, 2008; Molina-Azorín, Claver-Cortés, López-Gamero, & Tarí, 2009; Preston & O’Bannon, 1997). Furthermore, in recent years, several scholars (e.g., Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003; Delmas, Hoffmann, & Kuss, 2011; Etzion, 2007; Orlitzky, Siegel, & Waldman, 2011) have emphasized the need to extend the scope of analysis by exploring the determinants, potential contingency factors, and boundary conditions under which CEP and CFP are related. In other words, research has been called upon to adopt a more sophisticated view and to “look beneath the surface” (Delmas et al., 2011, p. 117) in order to get a better understanding of the mechanisms connecting both performance constructs.

Despite the enormous number of publications concerned with the relationship between CEP and CFP, the overall picture remains vague. While some studies have provided evidence of a positive relationship (e.g., Clarkson, Li, Richardson, & Vasvari, 2011; Hart & Ahuja, 1996; King & Lenox, 2001; Konar & Cohen, 2001; Russo & Fouts, 1997; Wagner & Schaltegger, 2004), others have sup-

ported the conclusion of a negative relationship (e.g., Cordeiro & Sarkis, 1997; Hassel, Nilsson, & Nyquist, 2005; Morris, 1997) or yielded insigniﬁcant results (e.g., Cohen, Fenn, & Konar, 1997; Graves & Waddock, 1999). Several explanations for the apparent inconsistency have been proposed, involving both methodological and theoretical issues (Ruf, Muralidhar, Brown, Janney, & Paul, 2001). These explanations address different aspects, describing (1) the lack of a sound theoretical foundation (e.g., Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003; Ullmann, 1985); (2) the lack of a clear idea of the direction of causality (e.g., Ambec & Lanoie, 2008; Surroca, Tribó, & Waddock, 2010; Waddock & Graves, 1997); (3) the inconsistency of deﬁning and measuring the constructs of interest (e.g., Busch & Hoffmann, 2011; Grifﬁn & Mahon, 1997; McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006); and (4) the use of misspeciﬁed models due to omitted variables and a lack of consideration of moderating or mediating inﬂuences (e.g., Russo & Minto, 2012; Telle, 2006).

# Prior reviews and meta-analyses: Rationale for the present study

Inconclusive ﬁndings in a given ﬁeld of inquiry (as it is the case for the CEP-CFP nexus) constitute great nuisances to researchers by limiting the understanding of certain phenomena and impeding credible scientiﬁc generalizations (e.g., Rousseau, 2006). Thus, it is not surprising that several attempts have been made to consolidate the empirical research on the relationship between CEP and CFP. In order to clarify the distinct contribution of our study, we brieﬂy review these prior works and explain why they merely allow limited conclusions regarding the focal relationship.

# Narrative reviews, vote counts and the superiority of meta-analysis

The vast majority of existing reviews on the relationship between CEP and CFP either used narrative approaches or applied vote count procedures. Narrative reviews, provided for example by Ambec and Lanoie (2008), Blanco, Rey-Maquieira, and Lozano (2009), Guenther and Hoppe (2014), Molina-Azorín et al. (2009), and Salzmann, Ionescu-Somers, and Steger (2005), summarize the available research in a descriptive manner without providing a quantitative integration. These reviews without any doubt have contributed to the integration of the vast amount of CEP–CFP studies. However, without calling into question the general appropriateness of narrative reviews, at least in cases where multiple studies have yielded inconclusive results, narrative approaches are subject to several limitations (e.g., purely descriptive nature, subjectivity, and lacking critical assessment) and thus hardly enable conclusions that make sense of conﬂicting empirical ﬁndings (e.g., Hart, 1998; Tranﬁeld, Denyer, & Smart, 2003). Another approach that has been applied for synthesizing the body of empirical CEP–CFP studies refers to the vote count technique (e.g., Guenther, Hoppe, & Endrikat, 2011; Horváthová, 2010; Margolis & Walsh, 2001). In vote counts study ﬁndings are simply coded and aggregated as positive, negative, or non-signiﬁcant (Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003). This approach has been strongly criticized by many management scholars and statistical experts due to several substantial problems (e.g., Type II error problems, ignoring of sample size differences, or lacking provision of a point estimate of effect sizes), which likely lead to invalid conclusions (Combs et al. 2011; Dalton & Dalton 2005; Orlitzky et al. 2003). In contrast to narrative reviews or vote counts meta-analytic methodology, which is based on accurate statistical aggregation, is the most sophisticated research-integration technique providing a sound way to quantitatively accumulate empirical ﬁndings, to make sense of inconclusive empirical evidence, and to draw conclusions that reconcile conﬂicting results (e.g., Aguinis, Dalton, Bosco, Pierce, & Dalton, 2011; Combs et al., 2011; Geyskens, Krishnan, Steenkamp, & Cunha, 2009; Orlitzky et al. 2003).

# Previous meta-analyses

Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) prominent meta-analysis explored the more general relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and CFP. Their study sample covered the years from 1972 to 1997 and only included US studies. By breaking down the entire sample of studies in different subgroups they examined, among other points, the relationship between CEP and CFP (139 effect sizes). Allouche and Laroche (2005) provided another meta-analysis including 82 studies concerned with the relationship between CSP and CFP. They also partly captured the CEP–CFP link by means of subgroup analysis (84 effect sizes).

There are several reasons why the existing CSP–CFP meta-analyses hardly allow drawing deﬁnitive conclusions with regard to the relationship between CEP and CFP. First, the number of CEP–CFP studies included in these analyses is far from exhaustive. That applies in particular to the inﬂuential study of Orlitzky et al. (2003), which included at the most only 17 CEP–CFP studies. Furthermore, their analysis only included studies published until 1997. Given that knowledge about social phenomena, in general, tends to be historically dependent (Combs et al., 2011; Gergen, 1976), and that environmental issues in particular have gained increasing importance during the last years, it is likely that study ﬁndings vary over time and that more recent studies that have not been included yielded different results. Second, despite the lack of a commonly shared deﬁnition or conceptualization of CEP (e.g., Etzion, 2007; Walls, Phan, & Berrone, 2011; Xie & Hayase, 2007), it is beyond question that CEP is a multidimensional construct (e.g., Clemens & Bakstran, 2010; Dooley & Fryxell, 1999; First & Khetriwal, 2010; Trumpp, Endrikat, Zopf, & Guenther, in press), which has been measured in several different ways. However, none of the CSP–CFP meta-analyses decomposed the CEP construct into more speciﬁc dimensions and thus failed to account for the multidimensional nature of CEP and possible moderation effects concerning this matter. Third, in all CSP–CFP meta-analyses the moderator analyses as well as analyses with regard to the direction of causality have been conducted only at the level of the overall analysis pertaining to CSP. As CEP constitutes one dimension of the broader (meta-) construct of CSP (Orlitzky et al., 2003), there are undoubtedly similarities regarding theoretical reasoning and empirical manifestations. However, methodological literature on multidimensional constructs urgently cautions that confounding construct level (in this case CSP) and dimension level (in this case CEP) would imply serious threats to validity (e.g., Law, Wong, & Mobley, 1998; Wong, Law, & Huang, 2008). Indeed, notwithstanding the similarities, there are also fundamental differences that may warrant a separate treatment of CEP and CSP (Bansal & Gao, 2006). Walls, Berrone, and Phan (2012, p. 892), for example, argued that environmental issues tend to differ from social issues because ‘‘they are technical, require speciﬁc ﬁrm capabilities and signiﬁcant capital investment, are guided by regulation, and have their own reporting criteria’’. Also empirical examinations have shown that CEP should be considered a distinct part of the overarching construct of CSP and that certain levels of CSP do not necessarily correspond to sim

ilar levels of CEP (e.g., Baughn, Bodie, & McIntosh, 2007; Hillman & Keim, 2001; Scholtens & Zhou, 2008; Schreck, 2011). Some scholars even questioned the general suitability of CSP as a meaningful construct (e.g., Marom, 2006; Peloza, 2009; Rowley & Berman, 2000; Schreck, 2011). Rowley and Berman (2000, p. 405) asserted that the CSP construct is “fatally flawed” due to aggregation of seemingly unrelated aspects, or in their words “mishmashes of uncorrelated variables”. Without taking a stand on this debate, we argue, at the very least, that empirical findings and conclusions regarding CSP cannot be readily transferred to CEP. Hence, apart from the finding that the relationship between CEP and CFP tends to be positive, at least for the (limited) number of studies examined in previous CSP–CFP meta-analyses, we cannot draw any inferences from these works pertaining to the CEP–CFP link, neither with regard to moderation effects, nor regarding the question of causality.

Two recently published meta-analyses sought to address this apparent gap in the literature. By conducting a meta-analysis of CEP–CFP studies, Dixon-Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand, and Romi (2013) found a positive, though weak, overall relationship. Moreover, they examined a set of contingent variables such as different firm characteristics (e.g., large vs. small firms) or methodological issues (e.g., archival measures vs. self-reported data). Despite the importance of the analysis provided by Dixon-Fowler et al. (2013), their study has three major limitations. First, the sample of studies on which Dixon-Fowler et al. (2013) based their examination is far from comprehensively encompassing the available empirical evidence, which is somewhat contradictory to the idea of systematic research syntheses (Rousseau, Manning, & Denyer, 2008). While their meta-analysis covered 37 studies (71 effect sizes) yielding a cumulative sample size of 22,869 observations, we draw in our main analysis on a sample of 149 studies (245 effect sizes) yielding a total of 201,511 observations. Hence, our analysis is based on much more fuller representation of available research allowing better estimation results and thus more powerful, valid, and generalizable insights.

Second, Dixon-Fowler et al. (2013) did not account for the issue of causality. Their study provided only a one-sided analysis, as it was exclusively based on studies that considered the causal direction of CEP on CFP. Although the majority of studies have focused on this direction of effect, the reverse direction, theoretically underpinned by the slack resources hypothesis, has also been tested and supported empirically (e.g., Earnhart & Lizal, 2006; Konar & Cohen, 2000). Our approach enables a fine-grained analysis of the interplay of the dimensions of the focal constructs and the direction of causality. Finally, we complement our main analysis, which is based on bivariate correlations, with a meta-analysis based on partial correlations. This serves as a kind of robustness test and allows us to examine a broad set of methodological artifacts that may account for the variation in the results of previous studies. More specifically, we examine the type of sample used in the primary studies, the degree to which particular control variables were applied, the (non-) controlling for possible endogeneity, and the timing of research. In sum, the main contribution of our paper is to consolidate the mixed empirical findings and to place the research on the CEP–CFP link on solid ground from which avenues for further research can be laid out.

After having discussed existing reviews and meta-analyses in order to provide the rationale for our study, we continue with pre-

Another meta-analysis of CEP–CFP studies has been provided by Albertini (2013). However, this study is subject to similar limitations. First, this meta-analysis build upon a sample of 52 studies yielding a total of 62,943 observations. While this exceeds the basis of the study of Dixon-Fowler et al. (2013) it is still far away from what we found to be the empirical evidence at hand. Second, although Albertini (2013) itself mentioned the problem of “green-washing”, her analysis also included studies that examined the relationship between corporate environmental disclosure and CFP. Several studies have shown that environmental disclosure cannot be equated with environmental performance, neither with.

senting the theoretical background from which we derive our hypotheses and explain the importance of examining potential moderation effects arising from methodological artifacts. Then we describe the study collection process, the coding of the studies, and the meta-analytic procedures. After that, we present our findings and discuss the implications. Finally, we note the limitations of our analysis and describe possible directions for further research.

# Theoretical background and hypotheses

Extending back to the 1960s, “when a general public awareness of businesses’ environmental pressures emerged” (Blanco et al., 2009, p. 464), research on the relationship between CEP and CFP has yielded a myriad of empirical studies. In essence, the research stream centered around two fundamental issues. One refers to the manifestation of the relationship itself (i.e., whether there is a positive, negative, or neutral relationship between both constructs). The second issue refers to the direction of causality (i.e., whether CEP influences CFP, either positively or negatively, whether CFP influences CEP, either positively or negatively, or whether there is a reciprocal or bidirectional relationship) (Preston & O’Bannon, 1997; Schreck, 2011). Several theoretical arguments have been proposed for each of the hypothetical forms of the focal relationship (e.g., Preston & O’Bannon, 1997; Salzmann et al., 2005). In the following we briefly review the most important theoretical approaches and present the hypotheses we seek to test.

# CEP influences CFP

Traditional economic reasoning suggests a negative impact of CEP on CFP. Proponents of the trade-off theory, such as Levitt (1958) or Friedman (1970), argued that environmental activities withdraw financial resources from a firm and thus weaken its financial performance, as the financial benefits of environmental activities are deemed to be lower than their costs (Preston & O’Bannon, 1997; Waddock & Graves, 1997). Based on (short-term) shareholder maximization logic, this perspective contends that environmental activities conflict with firms’ primary objectives, as the voluntary reduction of environmental impacts is considered philanthropy, which incurs social costs and contravenes profit-maximization (King & Lenox, 2002). These neoclassical positions have been increasingly challenged by various scholars who have provided explanations for a positive impact of CEP on CFP leading to a “win–win” situation (Porter & van der Linde, 1995). The most important theoretical frameworks along these lines are the natural-resource-based view (NRBV) and the instrumental stakeholder theory.

Introduced by Hart (1995), the NRBV extends the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984) by integrating the natural environment into this framework. According to the NRBV, a firm’s ability to address the increasing challenges imposed by the natural environment fosters the development of rare and inimitable organizational resources and capabilities, leading to a competitive advantage and superior financial performance (Chan, 2005; Hart & Dowell, 2011). The NRBV argues that there are three key strategic capabilities, each building upon different key resources and each providing different sources of competitive advantage: pollution prevention, product stewardship, and sustainable development (Hart, 1995; Hart & Dowell, 2011). Pollution prevention, for example, can save costs of installing and operating end of pipe technologies and may reduce material and waste disposal costs, and decreases compliance and liability costs (Hart & Ahuja, 1996; King & Lenox, 2002; Klassen & Whybark, 1999). Because the RBV emphasizes the interconnectedness of resources and capabilities, competitive advantage and improved CFP may not result from single resources, but from rather complex resource bundles (Hart & Dowell, 2011; Hoskisson, Hitt, Wan, & Yiu, 1999). Consequently, there are several mechanisms through which CEP may translate into CFP. For example, the adoption of environmental technologies and the implementation of an environmental policy can stimulate process innovations that may increase the efficiency of production processes (Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998; Surroca et al., 2010). A proactive environmental strategy may also foster organizational learning and advanced human resources practices that may increase employee skills and involvement (Hart, 1995; Russo & Fouts, 1997; Waldman, Siegel, & Javidan, 2006; Weber, 2008). Furthermore, high levels of CEP can improve reputation (Brammer & Pavelin, 2004; Hart, 1995; Surroca et al., 2010), which may increase a firm’s attractiveness as an employer and thus provides potential competitive advantages (Turban & Greening, 1996). Environmental activities can also lead to fundamental and beneficial changes with regard to decision-making processes and other aspects of organizational culture (Hillman & Keim, 2001; Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998). Hence, the reasoning of the NRBV allows a systematic examination of the CEP–CFP link by providing a rationale as to why proactive environmental strategies and management practices may constitute sources of competitive advantage and superior financial performance (Hart & Dowell, 2011).

Instrumental stakeholder theory (e.g., Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Jones, 1995) provides another theoretical perspective from which a positive impact of CEP on CFP can be explained. As responsible behavior towards the natural environment constitutes an essential part of the stakeholder expectations firms are faced with, CEP can be viewed as an attempt to meet these expectations (Buysse & Verbeke, 2003). Instrumental stakeholder theory argues that meeting the claims of key stakeholders (e.g., claims for improved CEP) contributes to superior CFP. Through successful stakeholder management and the satisfaction of stakeholder demands, firms may acquire several sources of competitive advantage, such as reputation, long-term relationships with suppliers and customers, or increased efficiency in its adaptation to external demands in general (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Hillman & Keim, 2001; Lankoski, 2008; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Surroca et al., 2010). For example, firms with superior CEP can increase their sales due to customer’s willingness to pay premium prices for products of environmentally responsive firms (Hart & Dowell, 2011; Hillman & Keim, 2001). Furthermore, CEP may lead to improved investor relations and thus may lower market risk (Busch & Hoffmann, 2011; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001; Sharfman & Fernando, 2008) and the cost of financial capital (Ambec & Lanoie, 2008; Lankoski, 2008).

In line with other scholars (e.g., Hart & Dowell, 2011; Russo & Minto, 2012; Surroca et al., 2010) we argue that instrumental stakeholder theory and the NRBV should not be considered as competing or disparate frameworks but as complementary approaches. First, a firm’s ability to encourage stakeholder integration can be considered an organizational capability (e.g., Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003; Hart & Dowell, 2011). Second, successful stakeholder management allows firms to access and capitalize on tangible and intangible resources (Russo & Minto, 2012). Moreover, stakeholders can provide incentives or information to improve a firm’s efficiency and thus may push firms to explore profit opportunities that have been overlooked by the firms’ management or whose costs have been overestimated and whose benefits have been underestimated (Hart & Dowell, 2011; Kim & Statman, 2012; King & Lenox, 2002). Along these lines, Sharma and Vredenburg (1998), for example, showed that effective stakeholder integration may enable firms to improve their waste reduction and energy conservation programs and thus may contribute to the development of valuable organizational capabilities. Hence, we ar-

gue that conﬂating instrumental stakeholder arguments with the ‘resources and capability accentuation’ of the NRBV provides a so- lid theoretical basis to propose a positive link from CEP to CFP.

CFP inﬂuences CEP

While most of the research on the CEP–CFP relationship focused on the question whether it pays to be green and thus examined the causal link from CEP to CFP, some scholars emphasized the possi- bility that the causal direction might be the other way around (i.e., from CFP to CEP) (e.g., Dooley & Lerner, 1994; McGuire, Sund- gren, & Schneeweis, 1988; Ullmann, 1985). Formally stated by Waddock and Graves (1997), the slack resources hypothesis sug- gests that superior CFP results in available (slack) resources that al- low companies to invest in environmental activities. Organizational slack can be deﬁned as ‘‘that cushion of actual or potential resources which allows an organization to adapt successfully to internal pressures for adjustment or to external pressures for change’’ (Bourgeois, 1981, p. 30). It allows ﬁrms to make invest- ments in resources and capabilities that are not likely to immedi- ately pay-off but that are necessary to improve the speed and degree to which ﬁrms can adapt to their external environments (Bansal, 2005; Cheng & Kesner, 1997; Levinthal & March, 1981). As emphasized by the NRBV, the development and implementation of environmental strategies and management practices draw on several resources and capabilities. Consequently, organizational slack allows ﬁrms to direct more resources towards the improve- ment of CEP (Kock, Santaló, & Diestre, 2012) and permits ﬁrms the latitude to seek innovative and environmentally sound solu- tions (Bansal, 2005; Russo & Fouts, 1997).

An implicit assumption of the slack resources hypothesis is that high levels of CFP result in available slack resources (e.g., Dooley & Lerner, 1994; Makni, Francoeur, & Bellavance, 2009; Preston & O’Bannon, 1997; Schreck, 2011). Correspondingly, the majority of studies testing the slack resources hypothesis draw on CFP mea- sures as proxies for slack (e.g., Clarkson, Li et al., 2011; Schreck, 2011; Surroca et al., 2010). However, it is worth mentioning that superior CFP does not necessarily result in organizational slack. Nevertheless, literature on organizational slack constantly con- ceived CFP as a precursor of slack resources (Seifert, Morris, & Bartkus, 2004; Singh, 1986) and thus slack is more likely to appear in high CFP ﬁrms. Moreover, Daniel, Lohrke, Fornaciari, and Turner provided meta-analytic evidence for a positive relationship between slack resources and CFP.

Bidirectional relationship between CEP and CFP

Given that both the arguments for a positive link from CEP to CFP and those for the reverse direction hold, the relationship be- tween CEP and CFP would be reciprocally causal, forming what Hart and Ahuja (1996) termed a virtuous circle. A possible theoret- ical explanation for such a bidirectional relationship refers to an integration of the reasoning of the NRBV (complemented by instru- mental stakeholder arguments) with the slack resources hypothe- sis (Surroca et al., 2010). Without a conjecture about where the circle begins, whether in the availability of slack resources (result- ing from superior CFP) or in initial environmental activities (Waddock & Graves, 1997), CEP and CFP may reinforce each other and thus constitute a complex relationship involving causal mecha- nisms going from CEP to CFP as well as mechanisms in which high- er levels of CFP lead to increased CEP. In other words, ﬁnancially successful ﬁrms may have the resources necessary to improve their environmental performance, which in turn increases ﬁnancial ben- eﬁts that again can be ploughed back into further improvements of CEP.

While temporal precedence is not identical to causality it is at least a strong indicator for it (e.g., Bono & McNamara, 2011; Mitchell & James, 2001; Wagner & Blom, 2011).

sion (i.e., outcome-based CEP). Process-based CEP refers to a stra-

tegic level and focuses on managerial principles and processes such

as environmental objectives, environmental policies, or environ-

mental management structures. Thus, process-based CEP reﬂects

a ﬁrm’s internal efforts to address environmental issues (Busch &

Hoffmann, 2011). Outcome-based CEP reﬂects the observable and

quantiﬁable results of these efforts (Delmas & Nairn-Birch, 2011)

and refers to measures such as the amount of released pollutants

or the ratio of recycled waste to total waste. In general, process-

based CEP can be considered a precursor of outcome-based CEP

(e.g., Klassen & McLaughlin, 1996; Xie & Hayase, 2007). However,

it should be noted that research has shown that process-based

CEP does not inevitably lead to improved outcome-based CEP in

all cases (Darnall & Sides, 2008; Jung, Kim, & Rhee, 2001; Nawrocka

& Parker, 2009).10

Given the substantial differences between the process-based

dimension of CEP and the outcome-based dimension, it is reason-

able to suggest that the relationship between CEP and CFP varies

depending on which CEP dimension is addressed. Busch and Hoff-

mann (2011), for example, found that process-based CEP (in terms

of carbon management) negatively affects CFP, while outcome-

based CEP (in terms of carbon emissions) has a positive inﬂuence

on CFP. Contrary, Delmas et al. (2013) in a recent study found

the process dimension to be correlated with CFP while the out-

come dimension showed no signiﬁcant correlation. As we do not

have strong reasoning as to whether the relationship would be

stronger for process-based CEP or for outcome-based CEP, we do

not offer directional hypotheses in this regard.

Aside from distinguishing between process-based CEP and out-

come-based CEP, CEP can be differentiated with regard to a ﬁrm’s

underlying strategic approach to dealing with environmental is-

sues. The strategic approach can be conceived in terms of a contin-

uum ranging from reactive to proactive (e.g., Aragón-Correa, 1998;

Buysse & Verbeke, 2003; Russo & Fouts, 1997; Sharma & Vreden-

burg, 1998). Reactive approaches aim at compliance with environ-

mental regulations and imply environmental activities to a

minimum level, usually referring to end-of-pipe solutions. Such

approaches emphasize the minimization of risk and liabilities

and do not fundamentally change a ﬁrm’s processes (Russo &

Fouts, 1997; Walls et al., 2011). Contrary, proactive approaches re-

fer to environmental practices that go beyond compliance, focus on

pollution prevention activities, and involve higher-order learning

and redesign of existing processes (Russo & Fouts, 1997; Sharma,

2000; Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998). King and Lenox (2002) showed

that ﬁrms pursuing a proactive approach (pollution prevention)

experience superior ﬁnancial performance, while ﬁrms pursuing

a reactive approach (end-of-pipe pollution control) fail to do so.

The theoretical rationale for this observation is that reactive ap-

proaches do “not require the ﬁrm to develop expertise or skills in

managing new environmental technologies or processes” (Russo

& Fouts, 1997, p. 538), while proactive approaches involve the

development of organizational resources and capabilities that are

potential sources of competitive advantage and that affect a ﬁrm’s

ability to gain ﬁnancial beneﬁts from improved CEP (Hart, 1995;

Hart & Dowell, 2011; Russo & Fouts, 1997; Sharma, 2000; Sharma

& Vredenburg, 1998).

Hypothesis 1a. Process-based CEP is positively related to subse-

quent market-based CFP.

# Moderation effects of methodological artifacts

One of the outstanding features of meta-analytic methodology is its potential to identify methodological and conceptual moderation effects that may be hidden in the empirical findings (Daniel et al., 2004; Lee & Madhavan, 2010). These moderation effects may emerge from systematic differences with regard to the applied statistical procedures or other study settings (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). For example, several scholars have argued that misspecified models (i.e., models that do not account for important determinants of the relationship) may be the reason for the inconsistency of the empirical results (e.g., McWilliams & Siegel, 2000; Surroca et al., 2010; Telle, 2006). These determinants may be correlated with either one or both of the focal constructs and can take the form of moderating variables, mediating variables or confounding variables (Orlitzky, 2008). Since the CEP–CFP studies differ considerably with regard to the extent to which they have controlled for these determinants, study findings are likely to vary due to differences concerning this matter.

Firm size has been suggested as a determinant of both CEP and CFP (Ullmann, 1985). According to Etzion (2007), firm size, rather than being a determinant factor in itself, may proxy several other firm characteristics that affect the focal relationship. For example, larger firms are more exposed to publicity and stakeholder scrutiny and face greater risks of litigation, making them more likely to focus on environmental issues (Clarkson, Li et al., 2011; Konar & Cohen, 2000). Moreover, larger firms tend to possess more (slack) resources (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978) that allow them to invest in environmental activities (Clarkson, Li et al., 2011). It has also been shown that firm size is positively associated with CFP for reasons such as economies of scale, better access to resources, or greater control over stakeholders (e.g., Gooding & Wagner, 1985; Orlitzky, 2001).

Because industries differ regarding their environmental impact (i.e., high- vs. low-polluting industries), factors such as the regulatory context, pressures from stakeholders, or a firm’s general ability to lower its environmental impact vary between industries (Etzion, 2007; Patten, 2002). Moreover, Russo and Fouts (1997) showed that industry growth may moderate the relationship between CEP and CFP such that the relationship strengthens in high-growth industries. Also the intensity of competition, which differs between industries, may influence the focal relationship (Ambec & Lanoie, 2008; McWilliams & Siegel, 2000). Hence, many studies have found evidence for a moderating effect of the type of industry (e.g., Busch & Hoffmann, 2011; Waddock & Graves, 1997; Wagner, 2010), which, however, may be caused by several reasons. In addition, the type of industry may also have confounding influences pertaining to the focal relationship, as the type of industry may also determine CFP (Porter, 1985), separately from CEP.

Empirical evidence suggests that firms with better CEP tend to incur lower levels of financial risk (e.g., Feldman, Soyka, & Ameer, 1997; Spicer, 1978; Sun & Cui, in press). Since CEP is likely to influence reputation and investors’ perceptions of a firm’s future performance (e.g., Gilley, Worrell, Davidson, & El-Jelly, 2000; Russo & Fouts, 1997), it may provide a type of insurance value by decreasing financial risk (Peloza, 2006). In other words, high levels of CEP, implying reduced environmental risk, determine investors’ risk perception and will be rewarded by the market (Sharfman & Fernando, 2008). Furthermore, firms with a proactive stance towards environmental issues face lower litigation risks and may attenuate the likelihood of regulatory interventions which can also have risk-reducing effects (Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). In sum, financial risk may mediate the relationship between CEP and CFP, which suggests that studies that fail to control for financial risk would yield upwardly biased estimates of the focal relationship (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000).

The relationship between CEP and CFP is also likely to be determined by a firm’s R&D activities. First, there is relatively strong empirical evidence that R&D intensity positively influences CFP (e.g., Griliches, 1979; McWilliams & Siegel, 2000). According to McWilliams and Siegel (2000) R&D constitutes a form of investment in “technical” capital which is suggested to result in knowledge enhancement leading to product and process innovation which in turn increase long-term financial performance. While, of course, R&D intensity does not represent a perfect measure of innovation (Baysinger & Hoskisson, 1989), it has been widely used in empirical studies as a proxy for innovation (Camisón-Zornoza, Lapiedra-Alcamí, Segarra-Ciprés, & Boronat-Navarro, 2004; Hitt, Hosskisson, & Kim, 1997). Second, R&D intensity may also be associated with CEP as R&D activities may be a precursor of CEP providing firms with innovative approaches to environmental issues (Christmann, 2000). For example, the initiation and implementation of a clean technology policy or the development of “green” products require R&D efforts (Etzion, 2007; Hart, 1995; Russo & Fouts, 1997). Hence, R&D intensity may have a confounding effect on the relationship between CEP and CFP and therefore should be considered as control variable (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000; Orlitzky, 2008).

Advertising intensity constitutes another factor that is likely to be involved in the CEP–CFP relationship. Capon, Farley, and Hoenig (1990) provided evidence for a positive association between advertising intensity and financial performance. Furthermore, advertising can be viewed as a means to signal environmental activities to stakeholders, which may expand the opportunities to derive financial benefits from CEP (Arora & Cason, 1996; Wagner, 2010). Especially with regard to financial benefits resulting from consumers’ “environmentally informed buying behavior” (Russo & Fouts, 1997, p. 539) and from an increased willingness-to-pay for “green” products advertising intensity may have a substantial moderating effect (Wagner, 2010).

Capital intensity is another frequently used control variable in CEP–CFP studies (e.g., Elsayed & Paton, 2005; Russo & Fouts, 1997). As capital assets are difficult to adapt to changing purposes.

and uses (Miller & Cardinal, 1994), capital-intensive firms may be less flexible and rigid in their maintained procedures, and need more long-term planning horizons (Kukalis, 1991; Miller & Cardinal, 1994). Therefore, firms with high capital intensity may be more reluctant to change their technologies and business models towards more environmentally sound practices (Etzion, 2007; Sharma & Henriques, 2005). Furthermore, capital intensity has been shown to be related to a firm’s cost structure (Berman, Wicks, Kotha, & Jones, 1999; Fiegenbaum & Karnani, 1991) and may be a determinant of CFP (Capon et al., 1990). Thus, capital intensity may confound the relationship between CEP and CFP.

Aside from whether the studies controlled for potential determinants of the CEP–CFP link, the study findings may also depend on whether a study controlled for the possible endogeneity of CEP on CFP. Endogeneity occurs in cases where the independent variable in a regression model is correlated with the error term, or due to simultaneous causality between the dependent and the independent variable (Sánchez-Ballesta & García-Meca, 2007; van Essen et al., in press). As outlined earlier, the relationship between CEP and CFP may involve bidirectional causality. Therefore, the fact of controlling or not controlling for endogeneity can be conceived as a kind of methodological artifact, which may have a moderation effect on the study findings.

Another study artifact likely to affect the findings regarding the CEP–CFP relationship refers to the type of sample underlying the empirical examinations. Previous studies have drawn on both single industry samples and cross-sectional samples. As already outlined, industries differ with regard to several issues that may determine the focal relationship. Thus, multiple industry samples may mask differences due to specific industry contexts (Griffin & Mahon, 1997). Consequently, several scholars pointed out, that research on the CEP–CFP link should be conducted within specific industries (e.g., Griffin & Mahon, 1997; Moore, 2001; Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wokutch & Spencer, 1987).

As knowledge about social phenomena is historically dependent, relationships between constructs may vary over time (Combs et al., 2011; Gergen, 1976). In view of the continuously increasing relevance of environmental issues this may particularly apply to the relationship between CEP and CFP. Moreover, study findings are determined by the underlying research design, which might have improved over time (Combs et al., 2011). Again, this may apply to the empirical research concerned with the focal relationship as earlier studies are subject to several methodological shortcomings (e.g., Russo & Fouts, 1997; Wood & Jones, 1995). Consequently, the timing of research may represent an artifact entailing potential moderation effects.

We argue that the outlined methodological artifacts may constitute important explanations for the inconsistency of empirical findings. However, as we have rather limited theoretical rationale for the effects of these artifacts, we do not offer hypotheses in this regard. This exploratory approach is in line with previous meta-analytic studies (e.g., Crook, Ketchen, Combs, & Todd, 2008; Geykens, Steenkamp, & Kumar, 2006; Kirca, Hult, Deligonul, Perryy, & Cavusgil, 2012).

# Methodology

# Literature search and inclusion criteria

To ensure that our study sample was as comprehensive as possible, we used three complementary search strategies. First, we conducted a systematic search in the following databases: Academic Search Complete, Business Source Complete, E-Journals, Elsevier Science Direct, Environment Complete, and GreenFILE.11

Second, we manually searched the reference lists of prior reviews and the studies we identified in step one (i.e., we employed an “ancestry” approach) (Aguinis et al., 2011). Third, we searched the SSRN database to locate additional unpublished manuscripts. After a first scan, in which non-empirical papers and case studies were excluded, our initial sample comprised 432 studies. We then filtered this sample against a set of several inclusion/exclusion criteria. First, to be included, a study was required to provide an empirical examination of the relationship between CEP and CFP.12 Second, we excluded studies that focused on the relationship between environmental disclosure and CFP. While several studies, mostly earlier works, used disclosure measures as proxies for CEP, more recent works have suggested that environmental disclosure does not necessarily represent CEP; it may even be negatively related to it (e.g., Hughes et al., 2001; Patten, 2002). Fourth, we excluded event studies due to their fundamentally different methodology. Finally, to be included in our sample studies had to report sample sizes and bivariate correlations or outcome statistics convertible to those (e.g., Bausch & Pils, 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003). As we run a second meta-analysis relying on partial correlations, we also included studies that facilitated the calculation of partial correlations (i.e., studies using regression analyses and providing t statistics and degrees of freedom). We accounted for the issue of non-independent samples by excluding studies based on the same data set. If we found different versions of a study, one published and others in the form of working papers, we included the published version. If we found several published versions of a study that used the same data set, we included the version with the largest number of firms (Rosenbusch, Rauch, & Bausch, 2013). By applying these criteria, we yielded a final sample of 149 studies, from which we calculated a total of 245 bivariate correlations (k = 245) that in sum are based on 201,511 observations (N = 201,511) and a total of 208 partial correlations (k = 208) based on 179,318 observations (N = 179,318). It should be noted that there is some overlap between both study samples because several studies provided both bivariate correlations as well as statistics allowing the calculation of partial correlations.13

# Meta-analytic procedures

In line with recent meta-analyses in management research (e.g., Carney, Gedajlovic, Heugens, van Essen, & van Oosterhout, 2011; van Essen et al., in press) we used Hedges-Olkin-type meta-analysis (HOMA) (Hedges & Olkin, 1985) and run separate bivariate and partial HOMAs. For our main analysis we relied on product-moment correlations (r) as bivariate measures. As a kind of robustness test and in order to examine the influence of methodological artifacts, we run a second analysis using partial correlations (rxy.z) (Carney et al., 2011; van Essen et al., in press). We computed the partial correlations from the t statistics and degrees of freedom (Doucouliagos & Ulubasoglu, 2008; Greene, 2007).14 Partial correlations capture the association between the variables of interest (xy), given a set of n control variables (z) used in multiple regression models (Carney et al., 2011). In line with van Essen et al. (in press) and

We included studies that either used accounting-based measures or market-based measures of CFP. However, several studies used perceptual measures derived from questionnaires. We included these studies when they applied quasi-objective measures (i.e., measures that replicate objective measures) (Richard et al., 2009) referring to the accounting-based or market-based dimension of CFP.

A list of the studies included in the analysis is provided in the appendix.

We used the following formula: (t²/(t² + df)), where t is the t statistic and df is the degrees of freedom. Because this calculation always produces a positive number, we converted it to a negative number if the regression coefficient was negative (Greene, 2007).

Doucouliagos & Ulubasogß ˘lu (2008) we used this property to examine the effects of certain control variables typically included in the regression models of the primary studies. As partial correlations measure the relationship of the variables of interest holding other factors (i.e., the applied control variables) constant, we can control for the contribution of these factors to the heterogeneity of the results (Doucouliagos & Ulubasogß ˘lu, 2008). We applied subgroup-analysis for this purpose.

For the calculation of the summary effects, we applied random-effects models (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). Since the majority of studies did not provide reliability estimates, we corrected the effect sizes for measurement error using a conservative 0.8 reliability estimate (e.g., Dalton, Daily, Certo, & Roengpitya, 2003; Deutsch, 2005; Lee & Madhavan, 2010) as recommended by Dalton and Dalton (2005) and Geyskens et al. (2009). Admittedly, this is an assumed artifact distribution. However, it corresponds with the mean value that Aguinis et al. (2011) calculated across 196 meta-analyses conducted in management research and in related fields. We used inverse variance weights to give more weight to more precise effect sizes. Additionally, we applied Fisher’s Z transformation procedures (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Confidence intervals were calculated at the 95% level. We calculated Q-statistics for testing the homogeneity of the effect size distribution (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). A statistically significant Q indicates the presence of moderation effects (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).

A common issue in meta-analysis refers to the so-called “file drawer problem” or publication bias. Publication bias is present when the magnitude, direction, or significance of a study’s results is likely to affect the probability that a study is published (Begg, 1994; Geyskens et al., 2009; Rosenthal, 1979). This may happen when the decision for submitting or publishing studies is influenced by the presence or absence of statistically significant results (Begg, 1994; Geyskens et al., 2009). To account for a possible publication bias, we applied Rosenthal’s (1979) “file-drawer” method and calculated the fail-safe k. The fail-safe k provides an estimate of the number of null-effect studies that would be needed to make the summary effect insigniﬁcant.

For testing Hypotheses 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d (referring to CEP and subsequent CFP), 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d (referring to CEP and prior CFP), 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d (referring to CEP and concurrent CFP), and 4 (referring to reactive versus proactive approaches), we run bivariate HOMA and differentiated in each case between process-based CEP and outcome-based CEP and between market-based CFP and accounting-based CFP respectively. For testing the potential moderation effects of methodological artifacts, we run partial HOMA. We divided the complete sample into subsets referring to methodological artifacts. Thus, we contrasted the effect sizes of studies that failed to control for certain determinants (i.e., firm size, type of industry, financial risk, R&D intensity, advertising intensity, and capital intensity) with studies that included pertinent control variables. Therefore, if we report a statistically significant QB (indicating significant between-group heterogeneity and thus the presence of a moderation effect), this suggests that studies that did not include this variable systematically reported stronger or weaker relationships than studies that did control for this variable. This procedure parallels the approach used by van Essen et al. (in press) and Allouche and Laroche (2005). We also distinguished between studies controlling for possible endogeneity and studies accounting for this issue. Furthermore, we contrasted studies drawing on cross-sectional samples with studies that focused on a single industry. Finally, we distinguished between studies published after the year 1997 and studies published earlier.

For robustness purposes, we also calculated the reliability-corrected correlations by using a 0.7 and 0.9 reliability estimate. We did not find changes in the main results of our analyses.

# Coding of the studies

To gather the data needed for our analysis, we developed a coding protocol (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). In general, the unit of analysis in our meta-analyses was the individual study (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). However, as noted earlier, we used two different types of effect size statistics: product-moment correlations for the bivariate HOMA and partial correlations for the partial HOMA. From 117 out of 149 studies we were able to derive both types of effect size measures, from 32 studies only bivariate correlations were available. While the coding of product–moment correlations was relatively straightforward, the coding of the partial correlations merits some explanation. A substantial number of the studies reported the results of several regression models, due to different measures of the constructs or different model specifications. In cases in which studies reported multiple results due to different regression model specifications that did not imply different sub-dimensions of CEP (i.e., process-based CEP and outcome-based CEP) or CFP (i.e., accounting-based CFP and market-based CFP), different temporal sequences of measurement, or differences with regard to the methodological artifacts we sought to examine, we calculated the effect sizes from the model with the largest R2 (Aloe & Becker, 2009). In cases in which the studies reported multiple results referring to different sub-dimensions of CEP or CFP, in cases of different temporal sequences of measurement, and in cases in which multiple results involve the methodological artifacts of interest, we included several effect sizes from the same study in our analysis. This proceeding, to some extent, introduced the problem of non-independence of data (e.g., Gleser & Olkin, 1994). However, we argue that it was the best possible approach, given the purpose of examining potential moderation effects (Bausch & Pils, 2009). Moreover, as Dalton and Dalton (2005) noted, dependency does not appear to be a serious problem in the field of management research, when compared to other fields. For each model from which we derived a partial correlation, we coded categorical variables referring to the methodological artifacts we suggested for potential moderation effects. Table 1 provides a description of the coding of the variables.

Initially a set of studies was coded collectively by the authors to establish and validate the coding rules and the decision heuristics (Sleesman, Conlon, McNamara, & Miles, 2012). Afterwards, one author coded all studies. In cases of ambiguity the authors met and resolved the issues through discussion before reaching consensus (Bausch & Pils, 2009; Kirca et al., 2012; Sleesman et al., 2012).

# Results

# Bivariate HOMA

Table 2 summarizes the results of the bivariate HOMA. The summary effect of the overall relationship between CEP and CFP is .102 (k = 245, N = 201,511, p < .001). The 95% confidence interval, ranging from .085 to .119, does not include zero. To test for potential publication bias, we calculated the fail-safe k (p = .05), which indicated the absence of publication bias, as 10,959 null-effect studies would be necessary to make the summary effect insignificant. To examine the causal direction of the relationship, we divided the data set according to the temporal sequence of measurement. Hypothesis 1b was supported as we found a positive effect of process-based CEP on subsequent accounting-based CFP.

1997 is the latest year covered by the meta-analysis of Orlitzky et al. (2003).

CFP (r = .085, k = 23, N = 16,970, p = .001). Contrarily, Hypothesis 1a was not supported and our findings suggest that there is no significant relationship between process-based CEP and subsequent market-based CFP as the confidence interval includes zero (95% CI: .037 to .051). Hypotheses 1c and 1d, which dealt with the influence of outcome-based CEP on subsequent CFP, were confirmed; we found a positive effect of outcome-based CEP on subsequent market-based CFP (r = .096, k = 17, N = 22,789, p < .001) and on subsequent accounting-based CFP (r = .051, k = 20, N = 16,606, p = .033).

Hypothesis 2a, which proposed a positive relationship between process-based CEP and prior market-based CFP was not supported as the confidence interval includes zero (95% CI: .102 to .230). However, we found support for Hypothesis 2b, concerned with process-based CEP and accounting-based CFP (r = .124, k = 12, N = 5716, p = .010). Furthermore, we found no support for Hypothesis 2c, which proposed a positive relationship between outcome-based CEP and prior market-based CFP (95% CI: .003 to .162). Also our results indicated that there is no significant relationship between outcome-based CEP and prior accounting-based CFP (95% CI: .048 to .099). It is worth mentioning that the findings concerning Hypotheses 2a–d should be interpreted with some caution because the number of effect sizes for the different subsets is relatively small. Nevertheless, small numbers of effect sizes are in line with other meta-analyses (e.g., Kirca et al., 2012) and should not seriously affect the estimation results (Geyskens et al., 2006).

Hypotheses 3a and 3b, predicting a positive relationship between process-based CEP and concurrent market-based CFP and concurrent accounting-based CFP, were confirmed as we found positive relationships for process-based CEP and concurrent market-based CFP (r = .095, k = 24, N = 28,599, p = .001) as well as for process-based CEP and concurrent accounting-based CFP (r = .130, k = 55, N = 43,215, p < .001). We also found support for Hypotheses 3c and 3d, dealing with the relationship between outcome-based CEP and concurrent market-based and accounting-based CFP. Outcome-based CEP was positively related to concurrent market-based CFP (r = .167, k = 21, N = 15,200, p < .001) and to concurrent accounting-based CFP (r = .194, k = 29, N = 15,589, p < .001).

Supporting Hypothesis 4, our findings indicated that the relationship varies depending on whether proactive or reactive approaches of CEP are applied (Q B = 6.348, p = .012). Moreover, as proposed, the relationship is stronger for proactive CEP (r = .138, k = 72, N = 54,361, p < .001) than for reactive CEP (r = .072, k = 48, N = 44,170, p = .001). It is worth mentioning, that we were not able to unambiguously assign all effect sizes to the categories of proactive or reactive. Therefore, the sum of the effect sizes of both subgroups (k = 120) is smaller than the overall number of effect sizes (k = 245).

It should be noted that overall the summary effects we found are small by conventional standards (Cohen, 1992), implying that the magnitude of relationship between CEP and CFP is rather modest. However, Aguinis et al. (2011) showed that meta-analyses in management research commonly yield rather weak summary effects in terms of magnitude.

The partial correlation-based summary effect is smaller compared to that based on product–moment correlations (rxy.z = .083, k = 208, N = 179,318, p < .001). The 95% confidence interval ranges from .066 to .100, not including zero. That means that even if the effects

of other variables that were included in multiple regression models are partialled out, or in other words, even if the focal relationship is puriﬁed (Greene, 2007), it remains positive, albeit relatively weak in terms of its magnitude. Again, the fail-safe k (p = .05) indicated the absence of publication bias; 10,849 null-effect studies would be needed to make the summary effect insigniﬁcant.

In terms of potential moderation effects arising from differences in the primary studies with regard to the applied control variables, we only found a signiﬁcant effect for the ﬁnancial risk variable (QB = 14.154, p < .001). As studies controlling for ﬁnancial risk yield smaller relationships (rxy.z = .049, k = 98, N = 98,791, p < .001) than studies which do not control for this variable (rxy.z = .113, k = 110, N = 80,527, p < .001), this ﬁnding indicates that latter studies tend to show upwardly biased estimates of the focal relationship. Also, our ﬁndings suggested that studies controlling for possible endoge-
neity (rxy.z = .027, k = 58, N = 82,942, p = .011) show weaker rela-
tionships than studies not controlling for this issue (rxy.z = .107, k = 150, N = 96,376, p < .001) (QB = 27.726, p < .001). Furthermore, our results indicated that studies relying on single industry sam-
ples (rxy.z = .115, k = 73, N = 51,629, p < .001) tend to ﬁnd stronger relationships than studies drawing on cross-sectional samples (rxy.z = .063, k = 135, N = 127,689, p < .001) (Q B = 8.922, p = .003). Fi-
nally, our ﬁndings suggested that the timing of research does not signiﬁcantly moderate the focal relationship (Q B = 2.402, p < .121).

# Discussion

In conducting this study, we sought to address the widely de-
plored lack of consensus regarding the CEP–CFP relationship. Our
main purposes were (1) to shed light on the direction of causality,
(2) to account for the multidimensional nature of both constructs
by disentangling the available empirical evidence with respect to
the constructs’ underlying dimensions, and (3) to explore whether
methodological artifacts provide possible explanations for the
inconsistency of the ﬁndings yielded by empirical studies to date.
Our ﬁndings enable us to provide solid ground for future research
on one of the most puzzling questions facing research on organiza-
tions and the natural environment.

While several scholars, on the basis of narrative reviews and
vote counts, have noted that a general conclusion cannot be drawn
or that ‘‘the only conclusion to be extracted is that empirical esti-
mates report mixed results’’ (Blanco et al., 2009, p. 465), our study
provides evidence that, overall, the relationship is positive.
Although the summary effects derived from our analyses are small
in terms of magnitude, we can clearly reject the neo-classical argu-
ments for a trade-off between CEP and CFP. Furthermore, though
our ﬁndings do not fully support the existence of a virtuous circle,
our results indicate that the relationship involves some reciprocal
causal mechanisms. Finally, we identiﬁed moderation effects of
several methodological artifacts, which to some extent provide
reasons for the inconsistency of study ﬁndings. In the following
passages, we expand on these and other issues that arise from
our analysis.

While most of the research on the relationship between CEP and
CFP has been tied to the question of whether it pays to be green,
more recently, scholars have begun to challenge the assumption
of an unidirectional relationship by introducing theoretical argu-
ments for a reverse direction or even a possible ‘‘two-way interac-
tion’’ (Molina-Azorín et al., 2009, p. 1094) in terms of bidirectional
causality. Hence, we divided the complete sample of effect sizes in
terms of the temporal sequence of measuring both constructs.
With regard to the causal link from CEP to CFP our ﬁndings prepon-
derantly conﬁrm the arguments of the NRBV and the instrumental
stakeholder theory. Outcome-based CEP is positively related to
both subsequent market-based and accounting-based CFP with a
slightly stronger relationship for the latter dimension of CFP. First,
this means that the observable and quantiﬁable results of a ﬁrm’s
environmental activities (i.e., outcome-based CEP) increase the
ﬁrm’s internal efﬁciency and have positive impacts on its tangible
costs and revenues (reﬂected by accounting-based measures). This
ﬁnding reinforces Porter and van der Linde’s (1995) assertion that
pollution is a sign of inefﬁciency and entails hidden costs. There-
fore, reduced environmental impacts in terms of less waste or de-
creased levels of pollution are accompanied with short-term
benefits that may result from lower costs of raw materials (due
to better utilization of inputs), reduced waste disposal costs, or
lowered liability costs (Delmas et al., 2011; Hart & Ahuja, 1996; Pe-
loza, 2009; Shrivastava, 1995). Second, this indicates that out-
come-based CEP also positively inﬂuences external evaluations of
a ﬁrm and may entail reputational effects (reﬂected by market-
based measures). Hence, this ﬁnding suggests that the market does
indeed value CEP in terms of accomplished environmental impact
reductions (Konar & Cohen, 2001). A recent example for the market
interest in outcome-based CEP is the Carbon Disclosure Project
(CDP), denoted as ‘‘the most powerful green NGO you’ve never
heard of’’ (Winston, 2010), which is tracking the greenhouse gas
emissions of major companies worldwide. The establishment of
the CDP goes back to an international initiative of institutional
investors, presently having $78 trillion under management.

With regard to process-based CEP, we found a positive relation-
ship for subsequent accounting-based CFP but not for subsequent
market-based CFP. This ﬁnding is somewhat surprising. As con-
tended by the NRBV, the relationship between CEP and CFP in-
volves the development of resources and organizational
capabilities, which in large parts are of rather intangible nature
(e.g., reputation, human resources, or organizational culture).
Therefore, market-based measures of CFP were suggested to be
more capable of considering the intangible effects of CEP (e.g.,
Baird et al., 2012; Delmas & Nairn-Birch, 2011). Moreover, several
scholars emphasized the rather long-term value creation potential
of environmental processes (e.g., Hillman & Keim, 2001; Kim &
Statman, 2012; Lankoski, 2008), which is more likely to be cap-
tured by market-based CFP. One possible explanation refers to
the fact that environmental processes do not always lead to im-
proved environmental outcomes (Busch & Hoffmann, 2011; Xie &
Hayase, 2007). For example, research has highlighted that the
implementation of environmental management systems (referring
to process-based CEP) does not guarantee ecological success in
terms of outcome-based CEP (Nawrocka & Parker, 2009). In some
cases environmental processes may even constitute merely a sym-
bolic gesture without meaningful and substantial implications
(Delmas et al., 2013; Wagner, 2008; Walker & Wan, 2012). Thus,
our ﬁnding that process-based CEP does not inﬂuence subsequent
market-based CFP, while outcome-based CEP does so, suggests that
the market rewards ﬁrms’ environmental performance if pertain-
ing to objective and quantiﬁable results but not if pertaining to
environmental processes, which might be considered as less reli-
able measures or even as ‘‘green-washing’’ attempts (Busch & Hoff-
mann, 2011). The positive impact of process-based CEP on
subsequent accounting-based CFP, on the other hand, may result
from successful internal efforts such as altered production pro-
cesses, which go along with direct cost savings that are not appar-
ent to the market or for some reason (e.g., overlapping effects of
other market-related incidents) are not reﬂected in investors’
perceptions.

With regard to the causal direction from CFP to CEP, we found a
signiﬁcant relationship between prior accounting-based CFP and
process-based CEP. This conﬁrms the slack resources hypothesis
proposing that ﬁnancial resources are necessary for environmental
processes (e.g., the redesigning of production processes or substi-
tution of polluting inputs). However, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant

relationship between CEP (both in terms of process-based CEP as well as in terms of outcome-based CEP) and market-based CFP. Also, we did not find a significant relationship between prior accounting-based CFP and outcome-based CEP. The former finding, in our view, is not surprising and may be due to the fact that accounting-based measures, with their rather internal focus and their backward-looking nature, better proxy for organizational slack than market-based measures. The latter finding might be explained again by the fact that process-based CEP does not necessarily lead to improved outcome-based CEP. Therefore, there might be cases in which high CFP firms use their resources for mounting environmental processes that do not effectively affect environmental outcomes.

While the findings discussed so far referred to studies allowing the establishment of causal inferences, most of the studies examining the relationship between CEP and CFP unfortunately draw on concurrent measurement for both constructs. Regarding this type of studies our findings revealed positive relationships for all subgroups. Furthermore, both process-based CEP and outcome-based CEP are more strongly related to concurrent accounting-based CFP than to concurrent market-based CFP. As noted earlier, studies that measure CEP and CFP contemporaneously strictly speaking do not allow establishing causal inferences. However, we argue that there may be certain circumstances under which it might be conceivable that CEP and CFP are related to each other in a concurrent manner. First, both CEP and CFP may be possible expressions of superior management quality. Several scholars suggested that the boundaries between CEP and good management practices are fluent and that CEP just reflects managerial excellence (e.g., Bowman & Haire, 1975; Waddock & Graves, 1997; Wagner & Blom, 2011). Along this line, both CEP and CFP may constitute the results of effective management and thus may represent two sides of the same coin. Accordingly, the quality of management would constitute a confounding variable in the CEP-CFP relationship. Unfortunately, empirical studies face the problem that good management is hardly measurable, if possible at all (Telle, 2006).

Second, it should be noted that concurrent measurement of both constructs in this context is not necessarily equivalent to absolute simultaneity. Usually, studies use data referring to a particular fiscal year. Hence, concurrent measurement in this context may involve a time span of one year. Therefore, certain environmental initiatives such as the conservation of energy or the reduction of costly hazardous materials may entail cost savings and immediate financial benefits that affect accounting-based CFP in the current period. For example, a recent study of McKinsey and Company suggested that the US economy bears a $1.2 trillion energy reduction potential (Granade et al., 2009). That means that even nowadays, a great number of low hanging fruits (Hart & Ahuja, 1996) are waiting to be reaped. One might argue that suggesting that managers would overlook such profitable opportunities is somewhat implausible and simpleminded. However, King and Lenox (2002) pointed out that managers may underexploit opportunities for profitable emission reductions due to search costs, prior expectations, or lacking complementary resources and capabilities for exploring “the locus of profitable pollution reduction” (King & Lenox, 2002).

Third, regarding market-based CFP, concurrent measurement may not undermine causal interpretation as market-based measures reflect investors’ expectations of future returns and thus should index CEP effects even in concurrent measurement. Several scholars argued that market-based measures are more appropriate than accounting-based measures for capturing the financial benefits of CEP (e.g., Davidson & Worrell, 1990; Delmas & Nairn-Birch, 2011; Hillman & Keim, 2001). Our analysis to some extent questions these theoretical sound propositions as we found stronger relationships for accounting-based measures, unambiguously at least for studies measuring both constructs concurrently. However, this finding is in line with the CSP–CFP meta-analysis of Orlitzky et al. (2003). One possible interpretation is that the relationship between CEP and CFP may be driven primarily by internal effects (e.g., increased production efficiency) rather than by external effects (e.g., reputation effects). First, this is indicated by the finding of a stronger relationship between CEP and CFP for accounting-based measures, which may be better indicators of internal efficiency than market-based measures (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Van Beurden & Gössling, 2008). Second, also our finding that outcome-based CEP, implying a more internal focus than process-based CEP, tends to show a stronger relationship with CEP points in that direction.

Furthermore, our findings showed that the strategic approach underlying a firms’ dealing with environmental issues significantly determines the relationship between CEP and CFP. We confirmed the widely expressed argument that proactive approaches to CEP are more likely to be associated with superior financial performance than reactive approaches (e.g., King & Lenox, 2002; Klassen & Whybark, 1999). Hence, our findings suggest that the redesign of production processes and the focus on source reduction and process innovation, inherent to proactive approaches (Russo & Fouts, 1997), induce greater financial benefits than a compliance mode.

Our partial HOMA results provided additional evidence for a positive relationship between CEP and CFP in general, because even when the influence of other variables was partialled out the relationship remained positive and significant. Moreover, our partial HOMA indicated the existence of moderation effects of several methodological artifacts. In order to examine whether other variables are involved in the focal relationship, we examined the influence of control variables applied in the primary studies. Surprisingly, we only found a significant effect for the financial risk variable while other control variables such as the type of industry, firm size, R&D intensity, advertising intensity, and capital intensity did not appear to affect the relationship. Our finding that studies controlling for firms’ financial risk yield weaker relationships parallels the result of Orlitzky and Benjamin (2001), who found that firms with superior CSP incur less financial risk. Hence, also with regard to the CEP–CFP link risk may play an important role. CEP may well provide some type of insurance effect (Minor & Morgan, 2011; Peloza, 2006) as it may reduce the probability of litigation, increase firm reputation, and may lead to tax benefits, lower costs of equity capital and lower costs of debt (Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001; Sharfman & Fernando, 2008). In terms of the reverse causal direction lower risk may allow better evaluations of prospective CFP and thus provides certainty with regard to the financial planning of environmental activities (Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). With regard to our (non)findings concerning the other control variables, it seems possible that variables such as firm size or capital intensity may be too broad proxies and that other contingent variables which so far have not been taken into account determine the focal relationship. For example, Delmas et al. (2011) showed that absorptive capacity may leverage cost advantages from environmental strategies. Furthermore, Surroca et al. (2010) provided evidence for mediating effects of human capital and organizational culture.

In addition, the partial HOMA revealed moderation effects with regard to the control for endogeneity and the type of sample. In view of the fact that study findings vary systematically with regard to whether the problem of endogeneity has been addressed or not, the partial HOMA provided additional support for the suggestion of bidirectional causal linkages between CEP and CFP. Furthermore, as our findings indicated that studies relying on single industry samples yield significantly stronger results than studies using cross-sectional samples, it reinforces the skepticism towards the appropriateness of cross-sectional designs for examining the CEP–CFP link, which has been raised by several scholars (e.g., Griffin & Mahon, 1997; Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wokutch & Spencer, 1987).

deed, especially outcome-based measures of CEP such as toxic investments and thus face lower costs of capital and higher levels of CFP (Sharfman & Fernando, 2008). On the other hand, firms with lower levels of risk have greater financial security, which may positively influence the decision for investments in CEP (Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). Finally, an issue that has not been addressed by our study refers to the potential influence of country-level factors such as different regulatory systems or different cultural values. Thus, examining whether the relationship between CEP and CFP varies across different institutional settings might be an interesting area for future research.

# Limitations and future research

Although we sought to provide the best possible evidence on the CEP–CFP link in both accuracy and comprehensiveness, our meta-analysis is not free from limitations. Like any meta-analysis our study is constrained by the nature and scope of the primary studies it draws on (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990). As outlined earlier, many of the studies on the relationship between CEP and CFP are subject to methodological flaws such as poor measurement of the constructs of interests, omitted variables, inadequate sampling procedures, and so on. We tried to account for these issues by distinguishing between different measurement approaches for both focal constructs, by examining different sets of temporal associations, and by examining methodological artifacts in our partial HOMA (i.e., the use of control variables, the consideration of potential endogeneity, the type of samples used). In doing so, we tried to shed light on potential reasons for the inconclusiveness of the empirical findings yielded so far. Nevertheless, we have to admit that there are further issues we were not able to address by means of our analysis.

# Conclusion

Motivation and starting point of our analysis was the inconsistency in the empirical findings on the relationship between CEP and CFP. By conducting a meta-analysis based on 245 bivariate correlations and 208 partial correlations derived from a total of 149 studies, we addressed the lack of consensus and provided evidence for an overall positive relationship between CEP and CFP. By considering the multidimensionality of both constructs and by focusing on the direction of causality, our analysis centered around two highly material issues pertaining to the focal relationship.

As pointed out, both constructs of interest are of multidimensional nature. While our analysis accounted for this issue by differentiating between outcome-based and process-based CEP and market-based and accounting-based CFP respectively, a more fine-grained breakdown was prevented by the number of available effect sizes. Along with differences pertaining to corporate activities (e.g., industry-level differences or differences due to varying levels of vertical integration), environmental impacts may differ substantially across firms making them highly context-specific (Goldstein, Hilliard, & Parker, 2011). Therefore, a more sophisticated differentiation of the CEP construct may yield important insights. Furthermore, the varying findings with regard to process-based CEP and outcome-based CEP call for further research. Similarly, the somewhat counterintuitive finding of a stronger relationship for accounting-based measures of CFP for studies measuring both constructs concurrently clearly warrants further investigations. Is the relationship indeed mainly driven by mechanisms internal to the firm rather than by external aspects? Furthermore, our analysis of potential moderation effects regarding the influence of control variables was limited to variables that had been employed in a sufficiently large number allowing subgroup comparisons. Given that the most commonly used control variables, except firm risk, did not appear to influence the results in a systematic manner, our analysis opens the door to an examination of other factors that might be involved in the focal relationship. In particular, we encourage scholars to look “under the tip of the iceberg” (Delmas et al., 2011) and to examine the influence of less visible aspects, which remained unexplored (e.g., human capital, organizational learning, or certain management styles). Additionally, future research may examine several characteristics of the general business environment, highlighted by contingency theorists, which might be important determinants of the CEP–CFP relationship (Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003; Russo & Minto, 2012). Future research should also look to the concrete mechanisms of how financial risk influences the focal relationship. While Orlitzky and Benjamin (2001), regarding the CSP–CFP link, conceived financial risk as a mediator, we argue that risk might also constitute a confounding variable. Less risky firms constitute generally favored investments and thus face lower costs of capital and higher levels of CFP.

# Abstract

Research on the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has consistently grown and is gaining widespread attention. Given the vast body of CEP–CFP studies, recently scholars have begun to take stock of the cumulative results. However, no study so far has meta-analyzed the findings yielded by event studies assessing the stock market reactions to corporate environmental performance-related events (CEP-related events). This paper sets out to close this gap by synthesizing previous empirical results regarding the stock market impact of positive and negative CEP-related events. Results indicate a positive relationship across studies in terms of positive market reactions to positive events and negative reactions to negative events. Furthermore, the findings show that the market reactions are stronger for negative events than for positive events (i.e., asymmetry in the stock market reaction). Finally, this study examines whether methodological artifacts (i.e., differences in the study designs) may explain the differences in the findings of the analyzed event studies.

# Introduction

Research on the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has been burgeoning for years and is still expanding. A plethora of empirical studies has been examining the CEP–CFP link and the question whether it “pays to be green” continues to receive unabated attention in both general media (e.g., Diamond 2009; Elgin 2007) and scholarly publications. Moreover, corporate practitioners are increasingly faced with external pressures from different stakeholders to behave responsibly toward the natural environment (Flammer 2013). According to the latest global survey of CEOs provided by Accenture and UN Global Compact (UNGC), 93 % of the 1000 surveyed CEOs believe that sustainability will be important or “very important” to the future success of their business (UNGC and Accenture 2013).

While research rooted in neoclassical economics proposed that any discretionary efforts toward improvements of CEP would decrease profits and thus violate shareholder value maximization (e.g., Friedman 1970; Jensen 2002); other scholars have challenged this view by putting

forward arguments for a positive impact of CEP on CFP. In particular, stakeholder theory (e.g., Donaldson and Preston 1995; Freeman 1984; Parmar et al. 2010) and the natural resource-based view (NRBV; e.g., Hart 1995; Hart and Dowell 2011) provided the theoretical grounds for postulating a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. However, empirical examinations have long yielded mixed results, ranging from findings indicating a negative relationship (e.g., Cordeiro and Sarkis 1997; Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn 2011), to non-significant findings (e.g., Cohen et al. 1997; Graves and Waddock 1999), up to findings suggesting a positive relationship between both focal constructs (e.g., Flammer 2013; Russo and Fouts 1997).

Due to the substantial body of empirical work concerned with the CEP–CFP link, scholars have begun to take stock of the cumulative results. Three meta-analyses have recently addressed the relationship between CEP and CFP (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat et al. 2014).1 In essence, the meta-analytic results suggest a modest positive relationship which, however, appears to be quite complex and subject to several moderation effects arising for example from different measurement approaches, causal ambiguity, and methodological issues (Endrikat et al., 2014). Broadly, empirical research has used three different types of methodologies for examining the CEP–CFP relationship: (1) portfolio analyses comparing the financial performance of model portfolios of firms with high CEP and low CEP, (2) multivariate analyses using multiple regression approaches or structural equation models, and (3) event studies assessing the stock market impact of positive or negative corporate environmental performance-related events (CEP-related events) (de Haan et al. 2012; Salzmann et al. 2005). The event study methodology appears particularly appropriate for examining the CEP–CFP relationship due to several reasons; for example, by focusing on stock market returns, event studies imply a forward-looking perspective on the financial consequences of CEP. Moreover, event studies evade the issue of endogeneity and are quite unambiguous with regard to the causal direction of the relationship. However, while the results of studies based on portfolio analyses and multivariate analyses have been captured by the above-mentioned meta-analyses, thus far no attempt has been made towards an integration and consolidation of the empirical evidence provided by event studies.

1 In addition, there are several meta-analyses regarding the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and CFP (e.g., Allouche and Laroche 2005; Orlitzky et al. 2003). As CEP can be considered a dimension or a component of the broader construct of CSP (e.g., Busch and Hoffmann 2011; Orlitzky et al. 2003), the CSP–CFP meta-analyses partly captured the CEP–CFP link by means of subgroup analysis.

In an effort to remedy this deficiency, this paper provides a meta-analysis that accumulates 53 effect sizes derived from 32 studies concerned with stock market reactions to CEP-related events. Meta-analysis, a tool for quantitatively synthesizing the findings across a number of studies, has become increasingly common in management research (Combs et al. 2011; Geyskens et al. 2009; van Essen et al. 2012). Particularly in cases where inconsistent findings impede any generalizations, it has become the methodology of choice for establishing consensus (Geyskens et al. 2009; van Essen et al. 2012).

The current study makes three contributions. First, it contributes to the “Does it pay to be green?” debate by complementing the existing CEP–CFP meta-analyses and thus completing the body of cumulative evidence regarding the relationship between CEP and CFP. Moreover, given the advantageous properties of the event study methodology, a meta-analytically derived significant population effect would provide a rather clear indication of an impact of CEP on CFP ruling out potential reverse causality. This is of particular importance because the direction of causality (i.e., whether causation runs from CEP to CFP or vice versa) still represents a disputed issue (e.g., Endrikat et al. 2014; Molina-Azorín et al. 2009; Nakao et al. 2007). Second, picking up anecdotal evidence, which suggests stronger market reactions to negative events compared with positive ones, this work offers theoretical reasoning for this phenomenon and incorporates this issue in the meta-analytic investigation. Finally, by conducting exploratory moderator analyses (Geyskens et al. 2006; Kirca et al. 2012), this article examines potential moderation effects arising from methodological artifacts such as different study design and sample characteristics.

This paper is organized as follows. First, the theoretical background is presented from which the hypotheses are derived. Second, the data as well as the methodology employed are explained. The presentation of the results of the analyses follows. Finally, the findings are discussed and important implications highlighted.

# Background and Development of Hypotheses

# CEP-Related Events and the Link between CEP and CFP

The event study methodology was developed in finance (e.g., Brown and Warner 1985) and has been widely applied in management research (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Event studies examine whether there are abnormal stock price effects due to announcements of unanticipated events or changes with regard to managerial decisions (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999). The crucial assumption underlying event studies refers to the efficient

# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events

Market hypothesis, which proposes that markets are able to anticipate and correctly interpret relevant news and quickly adjust security prices (Fama 1991; Frooman 1997). While it is commonly known that stock markets are not information perfect, they are considered to work with a high degree of efficiency and accuracy by continually assessing and valuing new information (Frooman 1997; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). Therefore, in cases of major events, abnormal returns (ARs) or cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) (i.e., significantly greater positive or negative returns) that accrue for the particular firm allow inferring that the event significantly influences the value of the firm (Frooman 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999).

The earliest event study examining ARs as consequence of CEP-related events, to the best knowledge of the author, was provided by Shane and Spicer (1983). They examined how the stock market reacted to releases of pollution control reports by the Council on Economic Priorities and found relatively large negative ARs especially for firms with low pollution control performance. Another prominent example is the study of Klassen and McLaughlin (1996), who analyzed the market reactions to (1) third-party announcements of environmental awards signaling superior CEP and to (2) environmental crises (e.g., oil spills) signaling weak CEP. They found significant positive returns for firms receiving an environmental award and significant negative returns for firms involved in an environmental crisis. While the majority of earlier studies focused on the US and usually examined announcements associated with pollution information, in recent times several event studies have been conducted in other institutional settings (e.g., Gupta and Goldar 2005; Xu et al. 2012) and incorporated a broader range of CEP-related events. For example, Gilley et al. (2000) provided an event study focusing on the announcement of product- and process-driven environmental initiatives. While they found no overall effect of such announcements on stock returns, the results of their study suggest differences in the market reaction with regard to the specific type of the environmental initiative announced. In particular, the stock market reacted more positively to product-driven initiatives compared to process-driven initiatives. Robinson et al. (2011) investigated how the stock market reacted to the inclusion of firms in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and found significant increases in market value for the firms being included in the index. Keele and DeHart (2011) examined the market reactions to the announcement of firms’ participation in the USEPA Climate Leaders program and found no statistically significant market reaction on the day of the announcement.

It is worth mentioning that the efficient market hypothesis is not free from criticism. In particular, behavioral finance scholars have challenged the different forms of the efficient market hypothesis (e.g., Shleifer 2000).

While the events examined by event studies are admittedly single discrete events, they signal cumulative environmental performance and future positioning to the marketplace (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). For example, an announcement of green supply chain initiatives can be considered a public signal with regard to a firm’s decision towards a proactive environmental strategy. This information is deemed to be rapidly impounded in the stock price so that a change in its value implies a change in the market assessment of a firm’s net present value and thus reflects the market’s perception of the financial impact of signaled CEP (Gilley et al. 2000; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996).

Several theoretical arguments have been put forward with regard to the relationship between CEP and CFP involving different manifestations and mechanisms (Guenther and Hoppe 2014). In particular, the early literature rooted in neoclassical economics (e.g., Friedman 1970; Levitt 1958) argued that environmental activities would withdraw financial resources from a firm and thus weaken its financial performance because the financial benefits of environmental activities are deemed to be lower than their costs. Furthermore, drawing on agency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976), scholars suggested that managers could opportunistically employ corporate resources to engage in environmental activities that enhance their own utility at the expense of good financial performance (Brammer and Millington 2008). For instance, managers may try to justify disappointing financial outcomes by engaging in conspicuous environmental activities (Preston and O’Bannon 1997).

In contrast, other scholars have argued that CEP can have a positive impact on CFP. Porter (1991) and Porter and van der Linde (1995) noted that pollution can be seen as a waste of resources and thus the reduction of a firm’s environmental footprint may also strengthen its competitiveness leading to a “win–win” situation. In particular, the NRBV (e.g., Hart 1995; Hart and Dowell 2011) provides arguments for a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. According to the NRBV, a firm’s ability to address the increasing challenges imposed by the natural environment fosters the development of rare and inimitable organizational resources and capabilities (both tangible and intangible), leading to a competitive advantage and superior financial performance (Chan 2005; Hart and Dowell 2011). Thus, proactive environmental strategies focusing on pollution prevention and environmentally sound product development may entail the development of organizational resources and capabilities and stimulate organizational learning (e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997; Sharma 2000). Hence, improving CEP may help in attracting and retaining a higher quality workforce (Turban and Greening 1996), may foster innovativeness (Sharma and Vredenburg 1998; Surroca et al. 2010), and may enhance decision-making.

processes and other aspects of organizational culture (Hillman and Keim 2001; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998).

Along the lines of Freeman’s (1984) stakeholder theory, it has been proposed that firms’ engagement towards improving CEP can be seen as potentially instrumental in obtaining necessary resources or stakeholder support and in mitigating the likelihood of negative regulatory, legislative, or fiscal action (Buysse and Verbeke 2003; Cheng et al. 2014; Flammer 2013; Jones 1995). Thus, superior CEP can increase customer demand (Hart and Dowell 2011), may improve reputation (Hart 1995), can contribute towards gaining legitimacy as a “license to operate” (Porter and Kramer 2006, p. 81), may decrease financial risk (Peloza 2009), and attract financial resources from environmentally responsible investors (Consolandi et al. 2009; Heal 2005).

In sum, there are several channels and causal pathways through which CEP might positively affect CFP. Moreover, the meta-analytic results provided so far are in favor of a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. However, while these meta-analyses did not incorporate the data provided by event studies, a meta-analytic examination of event study results would be particularly useful because event studies, despite some critical issues concerning the proper design and sound application (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999), exhibit several outstanding features.

First, focusing on stock market reactions obviates the need to analyze accounting-based measures of CFP, which may be subjected to potential manipulations due to choices regarding different accounting procedures (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; Richard et al. 2009). Moreover, while accounting-based measures of CFP are limited in that they entail a historical perspective (Hamann et al. 2013; Peloza 2009; Richard et al. 2009), stock market returns incorporate assessments of a firm’s prospective development and reflect the notion of external stakeholders, especially investors, regarding future performance (Fryxell and Barton 1990; Hamann et al. 2013). Thus, event studies imply a forward-looking view on the financial consequences of CEP. This point is of crucial importance because several potentially beneficial impacts of CEP are considered to accrue in the long term (Hart and Ahuja 1996; Peloza 2009). In addition, stock market returns also incorporate intangible assets and reputation effects (Richard et al. 2009), which are obviously relevant given the theoretically proposed mechanism linking CEP and CFP.

Another advantage of event studies for examining the CEP–CFP link is that they can rather clearly determine the direction of causality (Heal 2005). While correlation and regression-based studies in most instances cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causality or endogeneity, issues that are likely to be at play in the relationship between CEP and CFP (Endrikat et al. 2014; Flammer 2013; Hart and Ahuja 1996; Surroca et al. 2010); event studies reasonably allow inferring causality running from CEP to CFP.3

Furthermore, as several third variables (either of moderating or mediating nature) have been suggested to be involved in the CEP–CFP link (Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Russo and Minto 2012), it is of crucial importance to control for such factors in empirical tests in order to ensure valid and reliable results.4 In this regard, event studies “are unusually precise because companies serve as their own matched control when its stock price is compared before versus after a news announcement” (Margolis et al. 2009, pp. 13–14).

Due to the advantageous properties of the event study methodology, a meta-analytic overall effect calculated from event studies would provide strong evidence with regard to the question whether CEP has an impact upon CFP and if this impact is positive or negative.

In view of the preceding considerations regarding the theoretical arguments and given the results of available meta-analyses, the following hypotheses are posited:

H1a Across the body of event studies, there is a positive stock market reaction to positive CEP-related events.

H1b Across the body of event studies, there is a negative stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events.

# Positive and Negative Events: Asymmetry in the Stock Market Reactions

There are several event studies, which have examined the stock market reactions to both positive and negative CEP-related events. Some of those studies found stronger stock market reactions (in terms of magnitude of the ARs or CARs) to negative events compared to positive events (e.g., Consolandi et al. 2009; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996; Lorraine et al. 2004). Thus, there seems to be some evidence that the market punishes firms in cases of negative CEP-related events to a greater extent than it values firms in cases of positive CEP-related events. In other words, the stock market reactions to CEP-related events appear to be asymmetric.

There may be several reasons for reverse causal links between CEP and CFP. For example, firms with superior CFP may be likely to possess slack resources that allow them to invest in environmental activities (e.g., Endrikat et al. 2014; Waddock and Graves 1997). Furthermore, also CEP related events themselves might be a trigger for causal links from CFP to CEP. For instance, negative stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events in time period one may initiate corporate environmental investments leading to improved CEP in time period two. (I would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for raising this point).

For example, previous empirical studies have revealed moderating effects of firm size (e.g., Sharma and Henriques 2005), innovation activities (e.g., Wagner 2010), or industry characteristics (e.g., Hull and Rothenberg 2008) and mediating effects of reputation (e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997), organizational culture (e.g., Surroca et al. 2010), or firm risk (e.g., Bansal and Clelland 2004).

# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events

Different non-exclusive explanations can be offered for this phenomenon. Psychological research, in particular research on impression formation (e.g., Anderson 1981), consistently indicates that individual impressions and judgments concerning particular events or situations are inordinately influenced by more negative information than by positive information (Baumeister et al. 2001; Skowronski and Carlston 1989). That is, humans weigh negative events more heavily than positive events (Jayachandran et al. 2013; Lankoski 2009). This pattern, denoted as negativity bias or positive–negative asymmetry effect, has been recognized and repeatedly confirmed in several research domains (Baumeister et al. 2001); for example, for the voting behavior in research in political science (e.g., Aragones 1997), for media attention in communication studies (e.g., Shoemaker et al. 1991), or for memorization processes in cognitive psychology scholarship (e.g., Robinson-Riegler and Winton 1996). In the field of economic psychology prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) it is highlighted that individual decision-making patterns imply that greater weight is accorded to costs than to gains. By means of experiments Kahneman and Tversky (1979) revealed that people care more strongly about a loss in utility than they do about a gain of equal magnitude (Soroka 2006). A study of Sen and Bhattacharya (2001) indicated that positive–negative asymmetries might also be relevant in the area of corporate social responsibility (CSR). In particular, they found that consumers’ company evaluations were more sensitive to negative CSR information than positive information. Similarly, Lankoski (2009), drawing on data from an executive survey, showed that corporate responsibility issues that reduce negative externalities entail stronger economic impacts than those that generate positive externalities.

Another explanation has been put forward by Klassen and McLaughlin (1996). They pointed to the fact that negative events such as environmental crises entail financial implications more obviously than positive CEP-related events. Thus, such events in addition to signaling poor CEP also forward information with manifested financial implications compared to positive events such as announcements of environmental awards.

Finally, preannouncement information asymmetry effects might explain asymmetric stock market reactions. Doh et al. (2010), examining the stock market reaction to the inclusion in or the deletion from the Calvert Social Index, found significant ARs for deletions from the index but no significant ARs for additions. They argued that information asymmetries prior to the announcement of additions and deletions might explain this difference. While firms with superior CSP would be likely to publicize pertinent information, firms with deteriorating CSP would tend to withhold such information. Thus, announcements of addition to, or deletion from, a social responsibility index may involve differing degrees of information novelty.

In view of these arguments, the following hypothesis is proposed:

# H2

Across the body of event studies, the stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events is stronger than the stock market reaction to positive CEP-related events.

# Data and Methodology

Multiple search strategies were employed for this research to collect studies examining the market reactions to positive or negative CEP-related events. First, searches were conducted in major electronic databases (Business Source Complete, Academic Search Complete, EconLit, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library) using several combinations of keywords. Second, the reference lists of the studies identified in step one were manually searched (i.e., employing an “ancestry” approach; Aguinis et al. 2011). Finally, the SSRN database was searched to find additional unpublished manuscripts.

In line with other meta-analyses aggregating the results of event studies, the statistical information provided in the studies has been used to calculate an inverse-variance weighted population r (e.g., Stahl and Voigt 2008). Consequently, to be included in the analysis the studies had to report statistics that allow the calculation of simple correlations. After excluding a number of studies that did not provide the necessary statistical information, the final sample included 32 event studies providing 53 effect sizes based on a total of 8660 observations. The studies included were published between 1990 and 2013. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the analyzed event studies.

In order to distinguish between market reactions to positive and negative CEP-related events, two separate meta-analyses were conducted. The analysis with regard to positive events was based on 27 effect sizes from 4449 observations. The analysis regarding negative events was

I conceived CEP-related events as incidents referring to environmentally friendly or environmentally harmful corporate actions or behavior. Thus, announcements of environmental regulations were not considered as events in the sense of this study.

Keywords included terms such as environment, environmental, pollution, polluting, ecology, sustainability, performance, market, return, financial, economic, and stock.

For the employed statistical conversions, see for example Lipsey and Wilson (2001).

based on 26 effect sizes from 2172 observations. The population correlations (rs) were calculated by means of random effects models. Conﬁdence intervals were calculated at the 95 % level. To assess the homogeneity of the effect size distributions, Q B statistics were calculated (Hedges and Olkin 1985). Subgroup analysis was used in order to examine potential moderation effects (Hunter and Schmidt 1990). The complete samples for both positive and negative events were divided into subgroups referring to potential moderation effects and calculated separate meta-analyses for these subgroups (King et al. 2004).

First, the sample was split by distinguishing studies focusing on US firms and studies examining non-US firms. Although the majority of studies focused on US firms, scholars have recently begun to use samples drawn from other geographical regions (e.g., Gupta and Goldar 2005; Xu et al. 2012). Several factors which are likely to affect the market reactions to CEP-related events may originate from country-specific differences with regard to economic, social, legal, or political aspects. For instance, the level of a country’s economic development has been shown to determine the general degree and enforcement of environmental regulations (Dinda 2004; Grossman and Krueger 1995), which may influence the extent to which environmental issues constitute potential threats to organizational legitimacy (Zhu et al. 2007). Moreover, general attitudes concerning environmental issues that may affect investors’ reactions to CEP-related events strongly depend on national contexts (e.g., Baughn et al. 2007; Kilbourne et al. 2002).

Second, the studies were distinguished between studies examining events that occurred before the year 2000 and studies examining events that have occurred since the year 2000. Environmental issues have been gaining momentum throughout the last decades in both academic research and business practice. For example, Jermier et al. (2006) surveyed scholarly journals cataloged in the ABI/Inform Global database and observed an increase of more than 300 % in the number of publications related to the field of organizations and the natural environment from the period 1990–1994 to 2000–2004. Furthermore, from 1995 to 2012, the size of the US SRI market, measured in total.

In cases of sample periods involving years before and after the year 2000, the studies were coded according to the main emphasis of the sample period.

J. Endrikat

assets under professional management, increased by 486 % (Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment 2012). Given the significantly increased relevance of environmental issues, it is likely that the stock market reactions to CEP-related events have changed since the 1990s. The year 2000 was chosen for splitting the samples because the DJSIs, the first global sustainability equity indexes, were launched in September 1999.

Third, the sample was divided according to whether the study explicitly mentioned that it accounted for confounding events or whether the study failed to do so. According to McWilliams and Siegel (1997), confounding events constitute the most critical issue with regard to the event study methodology. Confounding events are firm-specific events, other than the focal event, that occur during the event window and might have an impact on the firm’s stock price. Such events can include dividend declarations, announcements of an impending merger, signings of major contracts, announcements of new products, filings of large damage suits, announcements of unexpected earnings, or changes with regard to key executive positions (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Concerns regarding confounding events can be addressed by screening for potentially confounding events and excluding the relevant observations from the analysis.

Finally, this work distinguished between effect sizes derived from ARs and effect sizes derived from CARs. ARs represent the difference between expected returns and actual returns, or in other words, returns earned by firms adjusted for the “normal” return process (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). ARs are usually measured on day zero (i.e., the date of the respective event) or on day 1 (i.e., the day following the respective event). CARs are calculated by cumulating ARs over a certain period of time, the so-called event window. Thus, CARs are assumed to measure the average effect of an event on the firm’s stock price (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). However, the use of CARs may exacerbate the problem of confounding events, especially if long event windows are used (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Furthermore, with regard to effect sizes calculated from CARs, this work distinguished between CARs calculated over the traditional 3-day event window (-1, 1) and CARs calculated over longer event windows.

A common issue regarding the meta-analytic methodology is manifested by the so-called publication bias or file-drawer problem. The file-drawer problem rests on the assumption that the decision for submitting or publishing studies is influenced by the presence or absence of statistically significant results in such a way that statistically non-significant findings are less likely to be published (Begg 1994; Dalton et al. 2012; Geyskens et al. 2009).

Consequently, meta-analytic calculations may yield upwardly biased results. To account for the file-drawer problem, I calculated the fail–safe k, which provides an estimate of the number of null-effect studies that would be needed to make the summary effect insignificantly (Rosenthal 1979).

With regard to the other subgroup analyses, no statistically significant moderation effects were found. However, for proofing that the difference was statistically significant, I conducted an additional meta-analysis including both effect sizes for positive and negative events as separate subgroups whereby the sign of the effect sizes for negative events has been reversed. The QB indicated a significant difference (QB = 200.360, p < .01).

Some observations might be worth mentioning. First, regarding both positive and negative events the stock market reactions tend to be slightly stronger for non-US samples than for US samples (positive events: r = .053, 95 % CI: .001 to –.106 for US samples vs. r = .092, 95 % CI: .008 to –.175 for non-US samples, negative events: r = -.164, 95 % CI: -.230 to -.096 vs. r = -.228, 95 % CI: -.339 to -.110). Second, while the population rs pertaining to negative events were similar for events before the year 2000 and events as of 2000, the r regarding positive events before the year 2000 was not significant (r = .032, 95 % CI: -.054 to –.117), contrary to the r pertaining to positive events as of the year 2000 (r = .077, 95 % CI: .023 to –.131). Finally, for negative events, both the r calculated from studies which controlled for confounding events as well as the r derived from studies not accounting for this issue were significant (r = -.139, 95 % CI: -.22 to -.054 and r = -.219, 95 % CI: -.298 to -.137). For positive events, only the r calculated from studies that controlled for confounding events was significant (r = .093, 95 % CI: .030 to –.156). To some extent these partially non-significant effects regarding positive events may be a further indication that the stock market reactions to negative events are more robust and generalizable than those to positive events.

# Discussion and Conclusion

Several studies examined the market reactions to CEP-related events and yielded mixed results. In an attempt to reconcile this inconsistency, the current work accumulated the empirical evidence of 29 event studies by means of meta-analysis. This study adds to the established body of cumulative evidence concerning the CEP–CFP link as it complements the existing meta-analyses (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat et al. 2014), which did not incorporate event study findings. Overall, my results corroborate the existing meta-analytic evidence of a positive relationship between CEP and CFP by demonstrating.

that there is a positive market reaction to positive CEP-related events and a negative reaction to negative events. Moreover, due to the nature of event studies, these meta-analytically derived estimates indicate a positive causal impact of CEP on CFP. CEP-related events indeed appear to alter the market’s perception of firms’ net present values of future profits and cash flows (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). However, what is not clear from the current meta-analysis is the exact reason why CEP-related events change the stock market’s perception of future firm value. Along the lines of the NRBV and the stakeholder theory, it could be argued that CEP-related events are effective in signaling a firm’s competitive resources and capabilities and its potential effectiveness in meeting stakeholder demands. Nevertheless, which potential benefits from superior CEP and which detriments from poor CEP are in particular valued or punished by the market remains to be established.

Furthermore, the findings suggest that there is asymmetry in the stock market reactions with stronger reactions to negative than to positive CEP-related events. The asymmetry can be explained in the light of the so-called negativity bias, a pattern that may be “one of the most basic and far-reaching psychological principles” (Baumeister et al. 2001, p. 362). To this end, the findings are in line with insights from economic psychology indicating asymmetric evaluations of potential losses and gains (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Hence, the stock market reactions to CEP-related events might just mirror a general cognitive pattern. However, from a more specific point of view, it can be argued that negative CEP-related events such as announcements of violations of environmental laws (e.g., Karpoff et al. 1998) or toxic releases (e.g., Hamilton 1995) demonstrate poor CEP in a clear and explicit manner. Thus, negative CEP-related events appear to constitute strong and (adversely) value-relevant signals for the shareholders. Contrarily, positive CEP-related events such as announcements of green supply chain initiatives (Bose and Pal 2012) or engagement in the EPA’s Climate Leaders program (Keele and DeHart 2011) strictly speaking may just represent a firm’s efforts not necessarily implying actual superior CEP. Accordingly, positive CEP-related events might not in all cases entail information that is sufficient to alter the shareholder’s evaluation of firm value. In addition, the asymmetric stock market impacts of positive and negative CEP-related events might be explained by information asymmetries prior to the events. Superior CEP might be already factored in by the markets, as firms with superior CEP are likely to publicize pertinent information, while poor performing firms would tend to withhold such information so that the “surprise” effect is much stronger for negative events (Consolandi et al. 2009; Doh et al. 2010). Future research may expand on the asymmetry issue and explore the reasons for the asymmetric market reactions to CEP-related events in more detail.

With regard to the examination of potential moderation effects, this work only found a significant moderation effect for the length of the event windows. For negative events the population r for longer windows was significantly smaller than that for the (-1, 1) window. For positive CEP-related events only the population r for the (-1, 1) window was significant while a significant population r for longer event windows was not found. From a theoretical point of view, this finding further highlights the more material effect of negative CEP-related events compared to positive events. Negative CEP-related events appear to entail stock market reactions that are stronger and more persistent over time compared with the reactions to positive events. Moreover, from a methodological point of view, this finding provides support for the recommendations of McWilliams and Siegel (1997) to use event windows that are as short as possible. Contrary to the argument of Barnett and King (2008) proposing that the market may need some time to capture the full impact of certain events, the current findings suggest that the market is able to factor in the information revealed by CEP-related events rapidly.

However, it is worth mentioning that the length of the event window was the only statistically significant moderation effect that was detected in the current work. While the width of the confidence intervals and the significance of the Q statistics for most of the subgroups indicated that the variation of the findings of the event studies included in the analysis was above that expected by chance, the subgroups failed to capture these effects. That means, while subgroup analyses indicated the presence of moderation effects, the particular effects could not be specified.

The failure of the present meta-analysis to reveal moderation effects that would adequately explain the observed heterogeneity clearly suggests a need for further research to identify moderation effects, attributed to both methodology and theory that may explain the variation in the study findings. For example, scholars may explore whether country-specific differences may entail moderation effects regarding the stock market reactions to CEP-related events. The current meta-analysis showed that regarding both positive and negative events the stock market reactions seem to be slightly stronger for non-US samples than for US samples. Since several factors that are likely to influence stock market reactions to CEP-related events are dependent on country-specific institutional contexts (e.g., Bansal and Roth 2000; Baughn et al. 2007; Etzion 2007), future research exploring the national context-specific mechanisms that may account for the differences in more detail might yield important insights.

# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events

Another interesting avenue for future research may refer to the frequently expressed notion that the market’s awareness regarding environmental issues has increased over time (e.g., Consolandi et al. 2009; Flammer 2013). The findings of the current study point in this direction as the population r calculated across studies examining stock market reactions to positive events that occurred before the year 2000 was not significant, contrary to market reactions to positive events occurring after the year 2000. Related to this, and probably even more interesting, is the question of why the increase in market reactions to CEP-related events seems to apply only to positive events but not to negative ones. Contrary to the finding regarding positive events, the rs pertaining to negative events were similar for events before the year 2000 and events as of 2000. This suggests that the stock market reactions to negative events may have not been subject to changes over time, while the reaction to positive events constitute a more recent phenomenon. One potential explanation may be that the negative financial effects of poor CEP arising from reputational damages or impeding fines and remediation costs have been well established for some time, while the beneficial effects of superior CEP resulting from competitive resources or improved stakeholder relationships have only recently been taken into consideration due to an increased attention on sustainability issues.

Finally, future research could also focus on the differences with regard to the specific events examined in the event studies. In view of the fact that CEP must be considered a multidimensional construct (Trumpp et al. 2015) it is obvious that also CEP-related events address quite different aspects of CEP. Therefore, one potential reason for the variation of the study results may refer to the variety of different events such as environmental awards and crises (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996), product- and process-driven environmental initiatives (Gilley et al. 2000), inclusion and exclusion from the DJSI (Consolandi et al. 2009), or membership in voluntary environmental initiatives (Keele and DeHart 2011). While it would have been interesting to explore whether the variation of the study findings might be attributed to the qualitative differences of the particular events, the very diversity of CEP-related events and, associated therewith, the small number of sufficiently similar studies did not allow constructing meaningful subgroups for contrasting the effect sizes in this regard.

To conclude, this study adds to the “Does it pay to be green?” debate by providing meta-analytic evidence for positive market reactions to positive CEP-related events and negative market reactions to negative CEP-related events. Thus, it indicates that CEP-related events affect the market’s estimates of future cash flow. Furthermore, the meta-analytic results demonstrate that the market reaction is asymmetric in that the reaction is stronger for negative events than for positive events. Finally, the analyses indicate the presence of moderation effects that could not sufficiently be explained by the subgroup analyses that were feasible on the grounds of the available data. Thus, this study entails the need for further research on this topic.

# Organizational capabilities for sustainability towards corporate sustainability benefits: a systematic literature review and an integrative framework proposal

# ABSTRACT

This research relates the theme of corporate sustainability to organizational capabilities from business strategy. The literature brings initial indications on the contribution of strategic organizational capabilities to corporate sustainability. However, these attempts are still incipient and non-structured. Thus, in order to explore different organizational capabilities that companies can develop to obtain sustainability benefits, this paper aims to propose an integrative framework that relates strategic organizational capabilities for sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits. For this, a systematic literature review was conducted, based on a paper sample of 88 publications extracted from the ISI Web of Science database. The paper also develops a descriptive overview of the subject, presenting the main gaps and a research agenda. The results showed that corporate sustainability is strongly related to business strategy and the ability of companies to develop specific capabilities. Thus, the understanding from academics and managers on what strategic organizational capabilities (OCs) consists and how they can be developed or improved is fundamental to reaching corporate sustainability. The paper presents some contributions. First, the integrative framework developed from the literature review comprises seven categories of organizational capabilities for sustainability (OCSs) related to ten categories of corporate sustainability benefits (CSBs). Second, the framework can contribute as a support tool for managers, by providing an explicit guideline on which capabilities that can be developed and/or improved in the organization to achieve a certainly expected sustainability benefit. Third, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature and those that need further research. Fourth, the overview of the literature of OCS by bibliometric and cluster analyses allowed a broad understanding of how academics have addressed these themes over the years. Finally, the research agenda developed from the literature review may broaden opportunities for further research on the subject.

# Keywords

Organizational Capabilities, Corporate Sustainability, Corporate Sustainability Benefits.

# 1. Introduction

The literature has indicated that organizations that take into account the impacts of their actions on the environment and society may achieve economic returns, competitive advantage and better performance (Dangelico et al., 2017; Hofmann et al., 2012; Barnett and Salomon, 2012; Reuter et al., 2010; Orlitzky et al., 2003).

In this scenario, the logic of corporate sustainability has been gaining prominence among companies and researchers have been studying corporate sustainability from a strategic perspective, considering that organization capabilities (OCs) developed by

companies can influence it (Amui et al., 2017; Annunziata et al. 2017; Branco and Rodrigues, 2006). OC can be defined as the ability of an organization to perform tasks to achieve desired results by using its available resource base (Helfat and Peteraf, 2003; Winter, 2003; Zollo and Winter, 2002).

The first relevant studies on resources and capabilities from a strategic management perspective are found from the Resource Based View (RBV) (Barney, 2001; Wernerfelt, 1984). The RBV focuses on resources and capabilities to explain the superior performance of some companies to reach a competitive advantage. A relevant contribution of this field is related to the dynamic capabilities approach (DC), presented by Teece et al. (1997) to explain competitive advantage in dynamic markets.

However, the RBV was considered limited since it does not incorporate the external environment. The incorporation of environmental issues into this body of knowledge was pioneered by Hart (1995), who proposed the Natural Resource-Based View of the Firm (NRBV) as a more complete framework when considering the natural resources and environmental problems into RBV. According to Hart (1995), the challenges posed by the natural environment are among the most important factors in the new pattern of resource development and OCs. Hart and Dowell (2011) analyzed that the economic and social environmental challenges raised in the NRBV have multiplied over the years.

In this sense, Annunziata et al. (2017) argue that sustainability-oriented companies should identify and develop specific capabilities rooted in the organization to implement practices that are a source of competitiveness in an increasingly aware and attentive market for sustainability issues. The literature presents several studies that address the OCs related to obtaining strategic benefits for corporate sustainability. For instance, it mentions the use of proactive environmental strategies (Delmas et al., 2011; Fraj Andrés et al., 2013; Peters et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2007; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998), successful implementation of environmental management practices and systems (Charan and Murty, 2018; Yu and Ramanathan, 2016; Johnson, 2017), support of corporate social responsibility (Choi et al., 2019; Ramachandran, 2011; Renouard, 2011; Torugsa et al., 2012), and support to the management of the green supply chain (Bowen et al., 2001; Choi and Hwang, 2015; Paulraj, 2011; Peters et al., 2011). In this context, attention to organizational capabilities related to sustainability is essential.

However, although there is a body of knowledge on OCS, there is a recent need for more research in this area. According to Gelhard and Delft (2016), the literature has

# Journal Pre-proof

been debating about performance in facing economic, social and environmental issues. Nevertheless, the relationship between OC and sustainability benefits remains little explored. For example, Gabler, Richey and Rapp (2015) argue that little is known about how firms determine and use the appropriate resources to maximize the performance of environmental initiatives. Yu and Ramanathan (2016) comment on the need to empirically explore the development of an environmental management capability. Hofmann et al. (2012) also stated that little is known about how strategic firm-specific capabilities may facilitate the adoption of sustainability initiatives. In particular, the present research addresses Amui et al. (2017) indication towards the opportunity for studies seeking to identify the types of dynamic capabilities that can be developed in order to more effectively overcome the emerging challenges of sustainability. Salim et al. (2019) also recommended how important is further research to expand organization capabilities, especially those responsible for environmental issues.

Thus, since OCS can bring strategic sustainability benefits for companies, and focusing on addressing these research gaps, this study seeks to answer the following research questions: (i) What are the main types of strategic OCS addressed in the literature? (ii) May the OCSs lead to the development of corporate sustainability benefits (CSB), and what would these benefits be? (iii) How strategic OCS and CSB can be linked together to provide an integrative framework? Therefore, this paper performs a systematic literature review (SLR) by providing: (i) an overview of the studies that addressed OCS, (ii) research gaps, and (iii) a research agenda. Based on the main findings, we proposed an integrative framework linking strategic OCS and CSB.

This paper contributes to the academic literature in some ways. First, it advances the knowledge of OCS, since it identifies and maps several strategic sustainability benefits that can be achieved by organizations through the development of OCs. Second, although recently Amui et al. (2017) have conducted a SLR on capabilities for sustainability in order to systematize the available knowledge, identifying the current lack of research on the integration of these themes, the authors did not focus on types of OCSs, nor the relation of OCs with the benefits of corporate sustainability. Salim et al. (2019) also conducted an SLR on organizational capabilities and sustainability, but their focus was on eco-innovation. Thus, this evidence demonstrates the advancement and contribution of this paper concerning the previous literature. Third, the findings may assist firms in improving their strategic OC, especially those responsible for CSB, enhancing sustainability performance consistent with the environmental and social.

changes. Finally, the paper allows a better understanding of obtaining different benefits of corporate sustainability through specific capabilities of the company, regarding the business strategy point of view.

This paper is structured as follows: after this introduction, section 2 presents the research methodology. Section 3 presents a general overview on OCS literature. Section 4 presents the integrative framework that relates to OCS with CSB. Section 5 discusses the literature gaps and presents a research agenda. Finally, section 6 presents the conclusions, implications, limitations and directions for further research.

# 2. Method

The SLR can be defined as a tool to identify, evaluate and interpret available and relevant studies regarding a particular research question (Kitchenham, 2004). The SLR steps adopted in this research are adapted from Tranfield et al. (2003): review planning, conducting the review, and reporting and dissemination (Fig. 1).

This Figure also describes the main objectives, methods, and tools adopted, as well as where the results were presented in the paper.

# Step 1 - Review Planning

Tranfield et al. (2003) argue that it is necessary to carry out studies to evaluate the relevance of the subject to be researched, as well as to delimit the area of study. In this step, we sought to analyze in a preliminary and exploratory way forms by which OCS research topics are being approached by the literature. We searched Google Scholar for papers that studied OC related to sustainability. We noticed that a great number of authors studies these themes, although recently. In this step, we also analyze the main terms adopted by the articles to define the search terms (strings). In this way, an adherent search could be conducted to cover papers that approach the subject.

# Step 2 - Conducting the Review

This step comprises stages for defining the portfolio. Tranfield et al. (2003) state that the search strategy should be reported in sufficient detail to ensure that it can be replicated. A search systematization begins with the identification of search strings drawn from the scope of the study and discussions with the group involved with the review (Tranfield et al., 2003).

Thus, using the ISI Web of Knowledge (WOS) database in February/2019, two searches were carried out contemplating the theme of organizational capabilities (and related terms) and sustainability (and related terms) (Fig. 2). The WOS can be considered one of the most prestigious academic literature databases in the world (Wang and Waltman, 2015).

The first search, named "search 1", had as search strings terms related to capabilities and sustainability (and its synonyms) in order to not lose relevant content. The search was conducted by the “title” on WOS. “Search 1” was complemented by "search 2", which added other search terms considered relevant for the sustainability approach, such as “social performance” and “social responsibility”. We also performed this search by “title” on WOS. However, a low number of results were obtained. Therefore, we performed another search but replacing the search for "title" with "topic" in the terms related to sustainability. Fig. 2 summarizes these searches.

Then, we began the selection of studies. For that, some analyses were performed as recommended by Ensslin et al. (2017) and Tranfield et al. (2003), aiming at alignment.

# Journal Pre-proof

Tranfield et al. (2003) argue that only studies meeting the specified inclusion criteria should be part of the sample. The authors underscore the importance of documenting the numbers of included and excluded studies at each step of the review, providing reasons for the exclusions. At this stage, the software EndNote was used to eliminate duplicates, and read titles and summaries of articles. After completing all the steps, the final sample consisted of 88 papers, which are presented in Appendix 1.

For the data extraction stage, Tranfield et al. (2003) argue that researchers should consider the information that will be required to design summary tables and to perform data synthesis. Forms may include details on the source of information (title, authors, journals, and publication details) and any other features that could be relevant to the study. In this research, a spreadsheet was created in MS Excel, fed with information such as title, authors, year, journal, number of citations, objectives, theories, methods, gaps, research opportunities and types of OCs. It was important for assisting the analysis of the studies.

Thus, articles were analyzed by content analysis, which is a highly flexible research method widely used as a systematic and rigorous approach to analyze data obtained or generated during the study (White and Marsh, 2006). According to the authors, content analysis may have qualitative and quantitative applications, or both, as is the case of this paper.

# Step 3 - Reporting and dissemination

An appropriate SLR should make it easier to understand the research by synthesizing works (Tranfield et al., 2003). Based on quantitative and descriptive analysis, we sought to obtain an overview of the articles. Thus, we analyzed the evolution in the number of articles over the years, research methods, sustainability pillars, geographical/sectoral arrangements, industrial sectors, countries where empirical studies were developed and journals with the highest number of publications. Finally, we performed a cluster analysis on the keywords of the sample articles using VosViewer software.

In the qualitative dimension, an inductive analysis was performed. It is recommended when there are no previous studies investigating the phenomenon or when knowledge is fragmented (Elo and Kyngäs, 2008). Thus, this analysis was appropriate for this research since we identified no studies seeking to identify and synthesize types of OCS.

# Journal Pre-proof

Thus, we sought to identify the different OCs and their relationship to sustainability. There was an extensive number of OCSs in the articles. We also realized that, although authors used different terms, some of such capabilities shared the same definition or were strongly related (see Table 2. General overview of OCSs categories, in Section 4.1). Therefore, it was possible to group them into categories. According to Cavanagh (1997), the creation of categories aims to provide a means of describing the phenomenon, increasing understanding and generation of knowledge.

To formulate categories through analysis of inductive content, it is necessary that the researchers interpret and decide which information should be grouped in the same category (Dey, 1993). The objective is to reduce the number of categories by grouping similar ones, or group different categories into broader categories (Elo and Kyngäs, 2008). In this paper, the OCs that comprise each category do not necessarily have the same meaning but are interrelated since their definitions complement each other.

As warned by Dey (1993), the development of such categories did not occur simply by gathering similar or related information. The OCSs were deeply analyzed as belonging or not to a given category by comparing them with other OCSs that belong or not to that category. Thus, it was possible to define where each OCS was best fitted and which category needed to be formed since no OCS could be placed in a category into which it did not fit. Thus, the OCS identified during the review process were grouped into categories since they have related concepts and definitions (regarding strategic capabilities for sustainability - see Table 2). The related terms adopted by the authors' sample are described in Column 3 of Table 2, allowing an understanding of the inclusion relationship with the category in which each OCS was found.

Since the OCS categories were identified, a similar procedure was performed to identify the expected sustainability benefits related to such capabilities. In this way, we verified that the studies related to OCS sought to investigate, in a general way, whether their development led companies to obtain benefits related to corporate sustainability.

The identification procedure was similar to that used for OCS, that is, some benefits were similar or related. Thus, such benefits have also been grouped into broader categories (Table 4). Each identified benefit was related to the article from which it was extracted. Finally, from these analyses, it was possible to develop an integrative framework that relates strategic organizational capabilities to sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits, as well as provide an overview on research gaps and propose a research agenda on the topic.

# 3. General overview on the literature on organization capabilities for sustainability

Fig. 3 presents the evolution of publications over the years. The first paper related to OCS was published in 1998 (Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). It is a relevant research since several other authors of this sample cited it (it was the most cited - 786 citations, according to the WOS). This may be an indication that some authors have started researching on this topic from the perspective of Sharma and Vredenburg (1998).

However, the studies are scarce in the following years, with an increase in 2008. The years 2015 to 2019 (the latter year encompasses only two months) indicate that studies on this topic has been intensified, demonstrating the relevance of this theme in the current context.

The articles were published in 45 different journals. Some of these journals have as their main scope topics related to environmental issues, while others have a more general and well-diversified scope, which indicates that different areas are linking their research to the OCS issues. The most significant journal in the sample is the Journal of Cleaner Production, with 16 articles. All journals that had more than two sample articles published have a relevant Journal Citation Reports (JCR), which demonstrates the importance of publications on the subject.

Fig. 4 shows that the research methods favor practical and theoretical approaches. The survey is the most used method, and represents the only type of quantitative approach of the sample. The use of this method has increased over the years (highlighting 2017 and 2018, with the largest number of publications). Regarding theoretical articles, there is a

significant number. This corroborates the fact that it is a subject of recent research and still demands exploitation of knowledge. Most theoretical articles deal with deepening of the study topics, relations between theories, among others. Among the articles with a theoretical approach, only Amui et al. (2017) and Salim et al. (2019) conducted an SLR, and none aimed to develop an integrative framework that related strategic organizational capabilities to sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits, which confirms the importance of this study.

However, there are only 13 among 88 articles using a qualitative approach (Fig. 4). Among case studies, 3 of them have a longitudinal approach. It is not explicit whether there is a tendency in using this method over time. However, from 2008, the case study has been used over the following years, which demonstrates the validity of this method within this research theme. Finally, only two papers adopted mixed methods.

# Fig. 5 shows the sustainability pillars as discussed over the years.

The environmental pillar is the strongest, and was studied mainly in isolation. However, there are articles contemplating the environmental pillar together with other pillars (social or economic, or both). The social pillar, separated from the environmental pillar, was the least explored, and only the article of Ramachandran (2011) was found. It should be noted that the economic pillar, although not used as a search string (since it is not part of the scope of this paper), is still evidenced from 2008. This is justified because many papers

Dealing with some pillar of sustainability (environmental or social) usually relate this analysis to the economic question.

In relation to the sustainability pillar, we found that most studies dealing with the environmental pillar in conjunction with other pillars still have a major focus on the environmental pillar. In this sense, most capabilities studied are related to the environmental pillar, which is why the findings of this research are focused mainly on this pillar.

Shows business arrangement where the studies were conducted. Most articles studied the context of individual firms, often identifying the industry of which the companies were a part. A low number of studies did not identify this sector. A considerable part of the works analyzed OCSs from the point of view of supply chains and, to a small extent, in the context of multinationals. The study of OCSs in the context of industrial clusters was conducted by only one research. This can be explained by Galdeano-Gómez et al. (2008), who argued that most studies have examined environmental capabilities internally, leaving aside the moderating role of business environment characteristics (e.g., spillover effects) and the cooperation between organizations through clustering for the implementation of sustainable initiatives.

Some studies focused on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which is interesting, since there are particularities in these companies such as reduced capital, centralization of functions, among others, that hinder the development of OCSs. Deepening studies focusing on this subject are still relevant since it is still scarce.

Table 1 shows the industrial sectors in which empirical research was developed. The manufacturing sector is the most representative, followed by chemical industries, construction industry and food industry/agri-food. Although there are more studies focusing on industrial sector, the service sector, specifically hotels and resorts, comes in third place. A wide variety of sectors aside those where environmental impacts are clearer (e.g., manufacturing, chemical industry, construction and industrial wastes) were also addressed (such as technology and services). This indicates that sustainability has been receiving attention by all business sectors.

Fig. 7 shows the geographical distribution of the countries where the empirical research was carried out, with a global interest in the subject. Countries with advanced economies, such as the US, followed by the UK and Germany, have a greater number of

studies. In addition, it can be observed that most researches were conducted in developed economies. Some have been conducted in developing economies such as China and Malaysia. China is the country with the largest CO2 emissions in the world. It is often the object of study in sustainability-related studies. This fact is evident in the sample since China appears in fifth place.

Finally, among the 88 articles, few studies developed an empirical study in more than one country. Sharma et al. (2007), Judge and Elenkov (2005), Luzzini et al. (2015), Sarpin et al. (2016), Behnam et al. (2018) and Betts et al. (2018) are some examples. Since cross-country research is more difficult to perform, studies focusing on this aspect are still rare.

Lastly, Fig. 8 shows the co-occurrence of keywords over time. There is a total of 36 words with a minimum occurrence of 5 times. It is observed that the most outstanding words are “competitive advantage”, “resource-based view” and “dynamic capabilities” and these have a greater incidence in the time interval from 2014 to 2016. As can be seen from Fig. 8, the most recent themes within this subject are “firm performance”, “eco-innovation”, “market orientation” and “collaboration”. In general, it can be analyzed that the keywords are very interrelated with each other and with the area of business strategy and corporate sustainability. For example, we identified terms with different approaches to (i) performance (financial performance, business performance, environmental performance), (ii) strategy (strategic management, environmental strategy), (iii)

competitive advantage and those related terms, and, (iv) sustainability (such as green, environmental management, corporate social performance, among others).

Finally, it is important to highlight that although these are not themes that are directly related to the themes of this research, we identified the incidence of terms related to innovation (eco-innovation, product innovation, product development) and terms related to supply chains, which is indicative that these themes are close to organizational capabilities and corporate sustainability.

# 4. Integrative framework relating strategic organizational capabilities for sustainability and expected corporate sustainability benefits

The present Section provides a qualitative and deep analysis of the paper’s sample. Content analysis techniques were conducted from which OCSs were identified (Section 4.2), as well as their relations to corporate sustainability (Section 4.2).

# 4.1. Organizational capabilities for sustainability (OCS)

As described in section 2, the OCSs were grouped into categories. These categories allow synthesizing the literature that addresses this research topic, thus helping in the understanding and operationalization of the constructs. Seven OCSs categories were created: capabilities related to collaborative relationships for sustainability (OCS1), capabilities related to the absorption of knowledge/learning about sustainability (OCS2), capabilities related to innovation/technology for sustainability (OCS3), capabilities related to alignment/motivation for sustainability (OCS4), capabilities related to marketing/external communication for sustainability (OCS5), capabilities related to flexibility/adaptation on sustainable issues (OCS6), and capabilities related to the management of sustainable operations (OCS7).

Table 2 presents the OCS categories, followed by a general definition assigned to each one. Since the similar and related capabilities that compose each category received different nomenclatures, the column 3 of Table 2 presents the terms of capabilities that comprise each category. Finally, column 4 presents the respective references that applied those terms.

Table 3 presents the evolution over the years of studies that addressed each of these OCSs. The studies are presented as codes (described in Appendix 1).

# 4.2. Relations between organizational capabilities and expected corporate sustainability benefits

The OCS1 are those most frequent within the analyzed paper sample (29 publications in total); OCS6 and OCS7 were those with the lowest number of papers (10 and 11 in total, respectively). It is noticed that the concentration of studies increases between the most recent years. This demonstrates the relevance of the theme in the current context.

It can be seen that OCS1, OCS2 and OCS3 have a larger number of articles that have studied it and are also the pioneers, being first studied in 1998 by Sharma and Vredenburg (1998) and continued to gain relevance over the years. Already COS5 is the most recent, with studies from 2011.

Since we identified the OCS categories, we extracted from the papers the expected corporate sustainability benefits related to OCS. Similar to the OCSs, such benefits have also been grouped into categories in order to synthesize knowledge and facilitate the understanding and operationalization of these constructs.

The sustainability benefits related to OCS were grouped into ten categories according to the similarity of their approaches. They are presented in the first column of Table 4 (the studies are presented as codes - see Appendix 1): support for environmental strategy/strategic proactivity (CSB1), sustainable innovation support (CSB2), support for environmental management systems/tools/practices (CSB3), improving the absorption of knowledge on sustainable issues (CSB4), support for corporate social responsibility (CSB5), green supply chain support (CSB6), improving environmental collaboration (CSB7), improving environmental adaptability (CSB8), improving green marketing (CSB9), and improving firm performance (CSB10).

The second column of Table 4 describes in detail these CSB categories and indicates how the literature relates them to the seven categories of OCSs. It can be observed that a large number of studies have addressed OCSs related to CSB10, CSB2 and CSB6. A low number of papers related to CSB8 and CSB4.

The achievement of these benefits is related to the development of different OCSs. The benefits linked to “improving firm performance” and “support for sustainable innovation” and “support the green supply chain”, for example, are linked to all the seven OCSs identified in this survey. Just as a single OCS can be tied to different benefits, such as OCS related to collaborative relationships for sustainability can bring companies nine of the ten sustainability benefits identified in the survey. This represents how important OCSs development is for companies to achieve a number of sustainability benefits.

By converging content analysis results from the seven OCS categories and the ten associated expected corporate sustainability benefits, an integrative conceptual framework emerged (Fig. 9). The framework summarizes the main findings of this research. The OCSs categories are presented along with the code of the articles that addressed them. CSBs categories are also presented along with OCS categories to which they are related, and along with the code of the article that addressed such relationships (codes are detailed in Appendix 1).

The colors demonstrate the presence of these categories in the analyzed papers. For example, the OCS categories and the CSB categories in green are the most studied by the sample's paper; the yellow has a moderate number of studies, while the red ones were categories with a greater scarcity of researches. Thus, based on the framework, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature, as well as those that still need further investigation. Through the framework, it is also possible to identify articles referring to each category (OCSs and CSBs), and the relations between these categories as addressed in each of the articles, thus helping to disseminate knowledge about these topics and further the development of new research associated to these constructs.

# 5. Literature gaps and opportunities for future research

From the quantitative and qualitative analyses, it was possible to analyze the characteristics and tendencies of the articles that addressed OCSs. Thus, we identified the main gaps in the literature and, from them, we proposed opportunities for future researches in relation to method used, sustainability pillars, business arrangements, countries and relationships between OCS and CSB categories.

# Methods

Regarding the methods used (Fig. 4), qualitative approaches require more research, such as single and multiple case studies, longitudinal case studies (which appear in a small number in the sample). Salim et al. (2019) corroborate with our findings, although the authors suggested focusing on internal eco-innovation capabilities by developing action research. Longitudinal case studies are relevant since sustainable actions and results from the development of OCS can, in most cases, be better visualized and measured over time. Qualitative approaches, in spite of limitations in relation to the generalization of results, are able to make in-depth and detailed analyses of the phenomenon under study. Surveys are not able to accomplish this because they are descriptive. New research can also use mixed approaches, as also recommended by Amui et al. (2017).

The survey method was predominant (Fig. 4). Thus, future studies can use mathematical modeling, such as multicriteria tools to evaluate the maturity degree of

# Journal Pre-proof

companies in relation to OCSs and prioritize factors and sub-factors relevant to the development of OCSs, for example.

# Sustainability pillars

Upon analyzing the studies, there are opportunities for new studies relating OC to social issues, since this pillar has been studied separately from the environmental pillar only by Ramachandran (2011) (see Fig. 5). Further studies should deal with more than one pillar (environmental, social and economic), since most papers dealing with the environmental pillar along with other pillars, nevertheless, have a main focus on the environmental pillar.

# Business arrangement

Considering that OCSs were studied to a large extent in the context of individual firms (Fig. 6), the importance of developing researches in different productive arrangements is stressed, such as industrial clusters, since only Hilliard and Jacobson (2011) studied OCS using this focus. Galdeano-Gómez et al. (2008) indicated that the findings on the effects external to firms on the achievement of competitive advantages based on environmental capabilities have important implications for future research in both environmental management strategy and the study of industrial agglomerations and geographic clusters. This is because clusters reveal that the business environment outside companies also plays a vital role in their performance (Porter, 1998). The cluster analysis (Fig. 8) has the same indication; that is, collaboration is a new subject, and the OCS could be studied in the context of networks.

Another alternative is related to the development of studies within the context of multinational companies, since only two studies had this focus: Chakrabarty and Wang (2012) and Pinkse et al. (2010). Such studies may produce interesting results because, depending on the location/country where the multinationals are located, comparative analyses can be done since aspects for the development of OCSs can be facilitated or made difficult by local characteristics such as culture, access to specialized labor, local development etc. OCSs can also be influenced by the location of companies. For example, in some regions, customers are more aware and more easily influenced to take sustainability issues into account in the consumption of goods and services, and pressures for environmental certifications, for example, are higher than in other regions. This can be captured and compared by studying multinationals.

# Countries

Since most of the studies carried out empirical studies in countries with advanced economies, there is an opportunity for research in developing countries and in different countries. This research opportunity was also analyzed by Amui et al. (2017) and Salim et al. (2019), who both had developed SLR with research themes related to this article. Therefore, it will be possible the development of comparative analyses on how aspects of the local context, such as economy and culture, influence the development of OCSs, as well as the expected CSB.

# OCSs and expected corporate sustainability benefits

As can be seen in Table 3, research on OCS and consequently on CSB has increased over the years and can be considered quite relevant in the current context. Studies focusing on OCS6 and OCS7 are still necessary, since they received less attention by the researchers in the sample. Regarding CSBs (Table 4), several OCSs are related to the same groups of expected benefits. However, some of them are unrelated, as can be seen in the Table 4, and therefore means future research opportunities.

Finally, from the research opportunities, it was possible to elaborate Fig. 10, which synthesizes the research agenda presented here. All relationships between OCSs and CBSs that have not yet been studied are identified by arrows between the first two columns. For all proposed relationships, there are opportunities for methods (column 3), geographical contexts (column 4) and, finally, countries (column 5).

# 6. Conclusions, contributions, limitations and future research

This research systematized the available knowledge on strategic OCS. Therefore, this paper performs an SLR by providing: (i) an overview of the studies that addressed OCS, (ii) research gaps, and (iii) a research agenda. Based on the main findings, it was possible to identify CSB from the OCS and propose an integrative framework linking both.

# 6.1. Contributions for theory and practice

This paper presents relevant contributions. The main contribution is the proposed framework (Fig. 9) that relates to OCSs (Table 2, Table 3, and Fig. 9) and CSBs (Table 4). The framework is relevant as it identifies and categorizes OCSs and CSBs that companies can acquire by developing and improving those OC. OCSs and CSBs have been studied over the years by a large number of authors, but no survey so far has been proposed to map the studies through an analysis of all existing literature. Based on this, we develop a framework that synthesizes all the OC developed by the companies (internal).

and external) and the sustainability benefits tied to those capabilities. This is the great contribution of this article.

Based on the framework, it is possible to identify OCS and CSB categories that have already been related in the literature. The OCS1 is the most relevant in the analyzed sample of articles. The OCS6 and OCS7 were the ones with the lowest number of articles, providing indications that still need further investigation. It is noticed that the concentration of studies increases between the most recent years. This demonstrates the relevance of the theme in the current context.

In practice, the framework can contribute as a support tool for managers, by providing an explicit guideline on which capabilities that can be developed and/or improved in the organization in order to achieve a certain expected sustainability benefit. Besides, the framework provides an overview on core aspects that can serve as basis for a comprehensive sustainability performance measurement system, providing a structured decision-making background for practitioners. This is crucial since decisions regarding sustainable issues combine a series of factors such as social responsibility issues, risks, economic issues, personal preferences and others (Maroušek et al., 2014) and according to Maroušek (2013) decision-makers of the current generation, who have more contact with academic knowledge, are more concerned with sustainability.

The second contribution is related to the overview of the studies that addressed OCS. Overall, through the overview, it was possible to identify the evolution of the research on the subject (Fig. 3), the research methods (Fig. 4), and the sustainability pillars over the years (Fig. 5). We also identified the business arrangement (Fig. 6), the industrial sector (Table 1), as well as the countries where the empirical studies were carried out (Fig. 7). Finally, a cluster analysis of the co-occurrence of keywords over time (Fig. 8) was developed.

The third contribution of this research was the presentation of a research agenda developed from the overview of the articles and the proposed framework. We concluded that various OCS and CSB still need to be identified and better explored in the literature, as well as the companies. The research agenda is important because it aids researchers by presenting several options for new studies, which allow furthering the knowledge on these themes (Fig. 10). Briefly, the research agenda shows that more qualitative and mixed research is needed, with a primary focus on the social pillar, or the three pillars together (social, environmental and economic), in the context of different productive arrangements (such as industrial clusters), multinationals companies, and in developing and different.

# 6.2. Limitations and opportunities for future research

This paper has some limitations. For example, in relation to the search and selection of articles related to the OCS, only one database was adopted. We use exclusion criteria such as conference documents and refinement by categories of research areas. This may have led to the loss of content. Thus, if other researchers refined this research using other criteria different results could be found. The research also focused on linking the OCS knowledge area with the CSBs and their results are based on this relationship. Future research can broaden the scope of OCS research using different search criteria, deepen the relationships found between OCSs and CSBs, or explore different relationships between OCSs and sustainability.

Another limitation is related to the lack of empirical validation of the developed framework. However, the relationships contemplated in the framework were developed from mapping the results from previous literature, which materializes its support. Even so, future research may validate the relations between OCS and CSB presented in the framework through empirical research, and, analyzing the practical results of this relationship.

Sustainable resource management, Corporate sustainability, Vague set, TOPSIS

Previous studies revealed triple bottom line cannot entirely cover the concept of corporate sustainability. This study thus uses sustainable resource management (SRM) to improve corporate sustainability (CS) performance considering the socio-environmental, socio-economical, and eco-efficacy aspects. In this study, the vague set (VS) theory and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method are integrated as a hybrid decision-making tool by which social media data can be transformed into entropy weights. The results indicate eco-efficacy and society should be prioritized to improve the corporate sustainability performance. Specifically, the aspects should be promoted through encouraging environmental innovation, redesigning consumers' offer, raising support of the institutions and policy measures, and organizing synergetic involvement. The contributions of this study are three-fold: (i) establishing a comprehensive framework for guiding firms make effective improvements; (ii) developing a hybrid VS-TOPSIS method to process the assessment data and social media information and address the interrelationships; (3) identifying the decisive SRM criteria to precisely guide the Chinese automobile industry towards CS under severe resource constraints.

# 1. Introduction

The Chinese automobile industry has witnessed a surge growth since the 21st century. In 2007, the amount of China's automobile production had reached 8.88 million, which resulted in a net increase of 16.6 million over the previous year. In the meanwhile, automobile sales reached 8.79 million. Under the 2030 sustainable development goals agenda, the Chinese automobile industry is striving for sustainable development. The industry is seeking appropriate managerial paths to balance the economic performance, environmental benefits and social reputation under limited resources. SRM is considered as a key instrument in assisting industrial sector to achieve the CS goal when developing sustainable resource strategies. Lozano (2012) defined CS as “corporate activity seeking to achieve sustainability equilibrium, which consists of the economic, environmental, and social dimensions (i.e. triple bottom line, TBL), for today as well as throughout the time dimension while addressing the firm's systems and its stakeholders”. However, it is argued that these three pillars of TBL can neither cover the entire concept of corporate sustainability, nor sufficiently address CS issues (Bordass, 2000; Jeurissen, 2000; Wu et al., 2018). Consequently, these studies presented difficulties in precisely identifying the CS problems merely from economic, environmental and social perspectives (Wu et al., 2019b; Wu et al., 2019d). Furthermore, TBL was found that it existed conflicts and overlapped field among themselves (Tseng et al., 2019b). Therefore, the socio-economic, socio-environmental and eco-efficacy aspects are added as a supplementary of TBL to enrich the CS literature (Wu et al., 2019a). Therefore, this study attempts to adopt SRM practice based on the TBL dimensions with the socio-economic, socio-environmental and eco-efficacy aspects to provide precise guidelines for Chinese automobile industry.

The Chinese automobile industry also requires a valid tool to be adopted to process types of data for decision making. Previous studies mainly considered qualitative data or quantitative data to inform decision-making processes when they discussed SRM issues (Mak et al., 2019; Ng et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019b). However, these studies ignored the critical type of data which stemmed from social media. Song et al. (2019) pointed out social media data can assist firms to avoid blind.

decision-making and provide more support and guarantees for developing SRM. Thus, this study designs a scrapping tool to collect the frequencies of keywords from social media and transfer them into corresponding entropy weights. Moreover, SRM is characterized with nonlinear, systematic feature (Song et al., 2019). Wu et al. (2019b) stated SRM possesses multiple criteria and includes several qualitative perspectives. Therefore, this study integrates VS and TOPSIS to address these problems. The novel VS-TOPSIS tool enables the transformation of experts' linguistic preference to vague set assessment matrix, as well as arranges all the obtained individual pro-t ratio matrix into the decision matrix. The ranking order can be computed to offer a specific direction for firms to utilize SRM practice to effectively and efficiently improve their CS performance.

Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the inter-relationship between SRM and CS and identify the decisive measures towards CS. This study provides three contributions: (i) establishing a comprehensive framework for guiding firms make effective improvements; (ii) developing a hybrid VS-TOPSIS method to process the assessment data and social media information and address the inter-relationships; (3) identifying the decisive SRM practice to precisely guide the Chinese automobile industry towards CS under severe resource constraints.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. CS and SRM

The concept of CS originated from the sustainable development concept (Engert and Baumgartner, 2015; Tseng, 2017). Elkington (1997) proposed planet, people and profits to provide the operational understanding for CS within a business context. Then, Cater and Rogers (2008) formally developed the TBL structure. Afterwards, many CS studies emerged with concentration on the discussion of the economic, social and environmental aspects (Shi et al., 2017). However, the three traditional components of TBL enable insufficiently the coverage of the overall concept of CS (Esquer-Peralta, 2007; Wu et al., 2018). Wu et al. (2019b) also argued there are overlaps among the TBL dimensions, and some operational practices have encountered dilemmas when classifying the operations and actions into TBL aspects as well. Hence, socio-environmental, socio-economical and eco-efficiency aspects have been supplemented to TBL to assist decision makers in precisely distinguishing the practices (Esquer-Peralta, 2007; Wu et al., 2018). More studies these years started to discuss about these newly developed aspects. For example, Heikkurinen et al. (2019) stated companies launching extended eco-efficiency actions can move towards a more sustainable economy. Qiao et al. (2019) found disregarding the socio-environmental losses might lead to failure in the decision process for developing sustainability. Wu et al. (2019a) supposed socio-economical aspect needed to consider social and economic perspectives simultaneously.

Bringezu and Bleischwitz (2017) defined SRM as “utilizing the natural resources in rational ways and maximizing human well-being without impeding the supporting of the living eco-system.” In previous literature, several studies have noticed the importance of considering socio-economic, socio-environmental dimensions into SRM towards CS. Dong et al. (2017) noted socio-economic played a critical role in developing urban sustainability for SRM based on literature analysis. In addition, Meng and Han (2018) explored the nexus among transport infrastructure sustainability, socio-economic and socio-environmental factors, and investigated the causal relationships between the variables. Additionally, eco-efficiency is proposed as a win-win operational strategy by means of consuming fewer natural resources and reducing financial costs for companies (Wu et al., 2018; Heikkurinen et al., 2019), while the discussion of the eco-efficiency was ignored in previous SRM studies.

# 2.2. Proposed hybrid method

Previous studies adopt qualitative data or quantitative data when they address the topic under SRM. For example, Ng et al. (2019) represented a systematic framework of SRM through gathering the quantitative data from the waste and resources action program and Tesco firm. However, the qualitative data need to transform with the purpose of performing valid quantitative computation following the appropriate way. Tseng and Bui (2017) noted that some mistakes may occur during the process of translating qualitative information to quantitative forms. Furthermore, these qualitative experts' respondence always contained ambiguous and uncertain information (Tseng, 2017). Thus, vague set theory was applied in this study to transform qualitative information into quantitative data.

Although existed SRM studies aim at systematically addressing the inter-relationship among SRM attributes, these studies mainly rely on statistical models to examine the relationship based on the independence, linearity and correlation (Liu et al., 2019). Accordingly, the interdependent and exerted feedback effects cannot acquire better demonstration. Therefore, Tseng et al. (2019a) proposed a hybrid fuzzy synthetic method to assess CS performance. However, fuzzy set theory only considered positive evidence by obtaining the single membership function (Gau and Buehrer, 1993). Moreover, TOPSIS was proposed by Hwang and Yoon (1981) aiming at addressing interrelationship inside selected attributes, and it is established by the thought that the selected ideal alternatives should have a minimum geometric distance from the positive ideal consequences and maximum from the negative ideal outcomes. It is commonly recognized as an easier and fast decision-making approach on firm's level (Huang et al., 2011; Behzadian et al., 2012). Therefore, this study combines the VS theory and TOPSIS technique to overcome the drawbacks of fuzzy sets and provide a handy tool for corporate decision-making, as well as fully considering the interdependent and systematic feature of SRM and CS (Tseng et al., 2019a).

# 2.3. Proposed measures/practices

Extending products' life span (C1) was stated as a highly effective strategy for reducing the use of economic resource loop (Bocken et al., 2016). Meanwhile, through utilizing optimal capability (C2), firms can achieve greater efficient performance in generating and managing economic resource (Lin and Tseng, 2016). Additionally, applying quality management mechanism (C3) is essential to allow the industrial sector to meet satisfaction, and enable the generation of profit (Lim et al., 2017). With respect to the logistics, optimizing horizontal logistics (C4) is increasingly considered to be a viable approach to lower cost and increase service levels, which significantly promotes the profit margin for firm (Defryn et al., 2019; Tseng et al., 2019b).

As for management strategies for environmental resource, adopting eco-design approach (C5) aims at minimizing environmental life cycle impacts, and thereby maximizing firms' limited environmental resource (Eksi and Karaosmanoglu, 2018). Besides, developing cleaner technology (C6) helps organizations to more effectively access natural resource, and produce products and services with less negative impacts (Büyüközkan and Çifçi, 2013). Considering that the sustainability reports can disclose the utilization of environmental resource, thus improving the transparency of sustainability reports (C7) plays a crucial role in increasing the environmental agility of firms (Roca and Searcy, 2012). Moreover, enhancing decision making resilience (C8) enables the dynamic decision while encountering the environmental pressure from internal and external stakeholders (Galpin et al., 2015; Islam et al., 2019).

Social resource always includes the issue of engagement and relationship which involves diverse and various stakeholders (Wu et al., 2019b; Singh et al., 2019). Therefore, organizing synergetic involvement (C9) can be applied to obtain social resource through aligning

Stakeholders’ engagement with a firm’s tactics (Wu et al., 2019b). Also, increasing employees' and customers' awareness (C10) will be of benefit to enhancing the efficiency of resource utilization through acquiring positive social resources (Shi et al., 2017). Moreover, raising institution's support and policy measures (C11) is capable of establishing social collaboration and participation among key stakeholders in society such as producers, consumers and government (Singh et al., 2019). Finally, advocating corporate culture (C12) is involved in the sustainable resource beliefs of a firm, which are embedding in arranging the social resource (Bonn and Fisher, 2011; Tseng et al., 2019b).

Industrial sector needs to take social and economic concepts into account simultaneously in order to address the SRM issue with regard to current product policies, market dynamics and competitive advantages (Singh et al., 2019). Thus, improving stakeholder interactions (C13) should be adopted as a core practice to achieve resource management goals, which is a manifestation of power embedded in the relationship between stakeholders and the SRM target (Frooman, 1999; Lin et al., 2019). After the stakeholders employ firms' resource to create value, it is beneficial for building value proposition (C14), which includes social value proposition and economic value proposition (Kristensen and Renmmen, 2019). Additionally, building eco-friendly rewarding systems for employees (C15) should be applied to integrate firms' economic development goal with performance evaluation system (Lozano, 2015).

On the macro level, there is a conflict between the quality and quantity of economic activities, the former is too inefficient, while the latter is stated to be too extensive, which leads to large-scale environmental problems (Daly, 1992; IPCC, 2014). To address this issue, eco-efficiency is proposed as a win-win strategy for firms to target a less harmful use of natural resources, and reduces cost for the company (Heikkurinen et al., 2019). Accordingly, encouraging environmental innovation (C16) can deliver a win-win situation for the economic and environment resource (Liao et al., 2018). Then, pushing the sustainability agenda into government policy (C17) has been argued that mostly in the sphere of eco-efficiency, which is an effective means to address sustainability issue and the financial bottom line of firm (DeSimone and Popoff, 1999; Dauvergne and Lister, 2012; Heikkurinen et al., 2019). In addition, redesigning consumers' offer (C18) enables reduction of the environmental load of the use phase (Baines et al., 2007; Heikkurinen et al., 2019).

Socio-environmental practices reflect various facets for solving internal and external sustainability issues, and reconcile company orientation with stakeholders’ needs (Spiller, 2000; Kassinis and Vafeas, 2006). Thus, pursuing eco-resource efficiency orientation (C19) can be expressed that maximize output while minimizing resources utilization without degrading social and environmental aspects (Horton et al., 2016; Von Geibler et al., 2016). Moreover, a potential effective way of managing a company's environmental policy is by socially linking it with purchasing function activities (Humphreys et al., 2004), for instance, selecting and collaborating with green supplier (C20) focuses on the buyer-supplier relationship where close relationship is necessary and capabilities are required (Sarkis and Talluri, 2002). At the same time, enhancing environmental awareness (C21) can be used to prevent negative impacts on the environment, as well as affecting the strategic development and their corporate reputation (Matos and Hall, 2007; Eltayeb et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2019a).

# 3.1. Fuzzy cluster method

This study applies FCM to categorize the proposed SRM criteria into several corresponding CS aspects. Supposing the raw cluster matrix is R = [rij]n×n, where rij denotes the degree of experts' judgement, which can be stated as the following equation.

Subsequently, the entropy associated with each item can be calculated by means of the following equation.

Where r represents the entropy for each indicator. If an indicator has smaller r, it has higher weight (Ding et al., 2017).

where σ = Eαβt + Eαβt × (1 − Eαβt − Fαβt), the linguistic preference and corresponding vague value. π = 1 − max Eαβt − max Fαβt, ε = 1 − min Eαβt − min Fαβt = 1. t t, and φ denote the important weight of expert d, additionally, ∑t=1nφt can be generated by means of the following equation.

Next, the degree of discriminability can be attained through applying the following equation:

dE r 7 1 rE (7) Where 1 − χrE represents the degree of divergence.

After obtaining the entropy and the degree of discriminability, the following equation can be used to determine the entropy weight rx for each alternative.

rE 7 dE r r71dE r (8) The decision matrix in TOPSIS can be generated based on the obtained aggregated matrix S, then it has to be normalized for attaining the normalized decision matrix =:

3.3. Vague set

Given that there are a set of criteria c = {c1, c2, …, cγ}, and the group of experts can be expressed as {d | 1 ≤ t ≤ n}, thereinto, n refers to the number of experts inside group. Initially, the original assessment information was present in the form of linguistic preference, such as very high (VH), high (H), medium (M), low (L) and very low (VL). Then the qualitative information must be transferred into corresponding vague value, as shown in Table 1. After obtaining the vague assessment matrix, pijt was adopted to represent the transferred vague assessment result of expert d t t = [E αβt, Fαβt]γ×γ, where 0 ≤ Eαβt ≤ Fαβt ≤ 1. Detailly, on criterion ci of cj, meanwhile, pijt was present with vague set, i.e. p ij.

Subsequently, this study applies the calculated entropy weight in Section 3.2 to calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix Z, which can be stated as the following equation:

Z7 [ z ]7 ij rE× S (21) After acquiring the weighted normalized decision matrix, the positive ideal solution x + and the negative ideal solution x − are determined by Eq. (22) and Eq. (23), respectively.

x + = { 1 , z+ … z , + =[ max nz+]} (22)

x − = { 1z ,… z , … z } =[ max zi (23)

Next, using n-dimensional Euclidean distance to compute the geometric distance of a criterion si from the positive ideal solution x + is given as:

DF 7 n (z ij zF), i 7 1, 2, 3 …,m 2 (24)

Similarly, the Euclidean distance of a criterion si from the negative ideal solution x − is presented as below.

D 7 n (z ij z ), i 7 1, 2, 3 …, m. (25)

Ultimately, the overall performance score, namely, the relative closeness of the criterion si is compared with positive ideal solution x +, which can be defined as follow:

RC i7 D i F D iF, i 7 1, 2, …Di ,m. (26) Where 0≤RCi ≤ 1, and the obtained value RC i provide the ranking of each criterion, and the criteria acquires higher ranking are those that have higher overall performance score RC i.

# 4. Results

Consequently, the ranking results of 21 criteria can be described as C16 > C11 > C4 > C9 > C18 > C21 > C8 > C20 > C1 > C5 > C14 > C12 > C6 > C7 > C2 > C3 > C13 > C19 > C10 > C17 > C15, similarly, the ranking order of 6 aspects can be expressed as A5 > A3 > A2 > A6 > A1 > A4. In addition, Fig. 1 depicts the results of sensitivity analysis while considering if includes the entropy weight calculated from social media data into the proposed hybrid method. The result indicated that there are four gaps existing in the criterion of C19, C17, C15, C10 which is consistent with the evaluation result. Thus, this study suggests that social media information can reveal the real situation of performing SRM practice, as well as present a more balanced CS development phenomenon among SRM criteria.

# 5. Implications

# 5.1. Theoretical implications

There is an obvious conflict between the economic growth and environmental protection in the industry when developing CS, because firms often assume substitutability between economic and environmental resources, and focus on relative efficiency gains, whereas largely ignores the rebound effect (Heikkurinen and Bonnedahl, 2013; Fuchs et al., 2015). The results show eco-efficiency can provide a trade-off towards an overall improvement. The aspect of eco-efficiency (A5) ranks first among all the aspects, referring that to reduce the consumption on natural resources needs to depend on encouraging environmental innovation (C16) and redesigning the consumers' offer (C18). Encouraging environmental innovation is important to achieving highly efficient production technology and methods to improve CS performance. Moreover, through encouraging environmental innovation, the industry can have the capacity to address preservation of natural resources, industrial efficiency and finally achieve the profit improvement. Therefore, eco-efficiency can provide both environmental and economic benefits through production efficiency.

Although social resource is argued as an inessential part in SRM (Sanginga et al., 2003), this study supports Bouwen and Taillieu (2004) that the social aspect presents great benefits to pursue CS through SRM practice. Therein, organizing synergetic involvement (C9) entails the alignment of multiple stakeholders’ engagement with firms' CS strategy, and long-term cooperative relationships between themselves and investors in capital markets. Without organizing synergetic involvement...

involvement to obtain social resource in SRM, the common interests However, to achieve CS goal, -rms need to transfer their business strategy and product designed concept into corresponding SRM practice. Geely Automobile Group performed a shift from “low cost and high quality” to “more safe, eco-friendly and energy-saving cars”. Also, Geely Automobile Group invested efforts in research and development process in terms of alternative fuels and fuel cells. The focal -rm witnessed all have a decent CS performance after the implementation of the SRM practice of encouraging environmental innovation.

# 5.2. Practical implications

Encouraging environmental innovation (C16) reveals that -rms should make endeavor to develop more eco-friendly technologies. Although many -rms started to take the environmental innovation into consideration of short-term business strategy, they neglected the long-term benefit according to encouraging environmental innovation. For instance, the Great Wall decided to redesign the customers' offer and begun to launch a fashion and sports.

car model under SRM concept, resulting in the selling of the new model reaching over 10 thousand in several months. Accordingly, when customers present a desire for sustainable production, firms should adjust and redesign the customers' offer with the purpose of adapting to the new and real market situation.

Raising institution's support and policy measures (11) played a significant role in improving CS performance for Chinese automobile industry. In prior literature, the importance of institutional support and government-support measures in stimulating technological innovation was researched extensively (Veblen, 1915; Nelson, 2008). Lundvall (1992) also emphasized the embedding organizations and institutions can actively advance the role of research and development in each industry. This study has found the similar conclusion in the Chinese automobile industry. For example, in response to the policy of energy-saving and emission-reduction, Chery has undertaken many national key researches and development tasks of new energy technology, and consequently achieved a profit increase of 35.7% in 2017. This evidence proves that the institution's support and policy can push firms towards CS goal.

Moreover, one of the goals of SRM is to promote resource and energy optimization, better infrastructure, and access to basic amenities, green environment through organizing synergetic involvement (C9). Organizing synergetic involvement implies firms should align stakeholders' engagement with a firm's CS target. In the real situation, firms always seek more involvement or alliances among stakeholders' in supply chain networks, for instance, China First Automobile Group (FAW) always aims at protecting and aligning its stakeholders, which has re-established it as the distributor support department to support distributors. Furthermore, existed literature has clearly suggested that synergetic involvement among stakeholders' is essential to improve CS performance (Bocken et al., 2014; Schoenherr and Speier-Pero, 2015).

This study presents three main contributions as follows: (1) it provides a theoretical contribution through collecting SRM measures/practices from previous literature and establish a comprehensive framework between SRM and CS. Thereinto, eco-efficiency, socio-environmental and socio-economic aspects were proposed to supplement TBL. (2) it provides a methodological contribution by integrating VS theory and TOPSIS method to study the interrelationship between SRM and CS, as well as gathering social media information and transfers them into corresponding entropy weight and make an improvement to efficiently reduce time consumption of decision making. Additionally, the result of sensitivity analysis shows that the integration with social media data can help effectively eliminate the subjective judgement, as well as identify practical gaps in real situation. (3) the obtained analytical results in this study can help decision-makers to select the decisive SRM practice which can be used to provide precise guidelines for Chinese automobile industry towards CS goal.

This study has several limitations that need future studies to overcome. First, the selected 21 SRM practices may not enough to reveal the real situation, thus future study may require taking more proper SRM practices into account. Moreover, this study proposed VS-TOPSIS to measure the geometric interrelationship among alternatives, while the causal relationship cannot be reflected. Hence, future study may need to consider further modifying this method.

# Abstract

Numerous studies have investigated the business benefits of corporate philanthropy (CP), which can be considered as part of a company’s belief systems. However, it remains unclear under which conditions and to what extent philanthropic activities are associated with corporate financial performance (CFP). This study sets out to shed light on the relationship between CP and CFP by means of a meta-analysis. A total of 183 effect sizes from 45 empirical studies are statistically integrated and analyzed within several subgroups. Particular attention is paid to time-lagged variable measurements that allow interpretation for causality. The general relationship between CP and CFP is found to be significantly positive. Furthermore, results reveal that CP is positively related to subsequent CFP across a wide range of different study designs, including different operationalizations of CFP and CP, different sample criteria, and the control for moderating variables. This paper goes beyond the question of if CP affects CFP and provides a status quo for a more detailed discussion on how and when CP influences CFP. Consequently, integrating research on mediating variables and adding perspectives of management control literature to the CP research field are suggested as promising avenues for future research.

# 1 Introduction

Against the argument of Friedman (1970) that the only social responsibility of a corporation is to generate profit, the contemporary understanding is that companies are closely intertwined with and dependent on the society around them (Porter and Kramer 2002) and should be controlled accordingly. Consumers, employees, and other stakeholders expect business organizations to meet legal requirements and minimize damage inflicted on society and, moreover, they want them to actively engage in solving societal problems (Carroll 1991) and expect management attention to be directed towards these objectives.

The associated general concept of business interacting with society is referred to as corporate social responsibility (CSR; Dahlsrud 2008), whereas the combination of CSR principles, processes, and outcomes is defined as corporate social performance (CSP; Wood 1991). Corporate philanthropy (CP), understood as the voluntary donation of firm resources to society, forms an important part of this concept and is often used as a proxy when financial outcomes of CSR activities are evaluated (Wang et al. 2015). However, CSP is a multidimensional construct, including aspects such as fair employee treatment, legal compliance, environmental performance, or community involvement (Rowley and Berman 2000). Each of these specific dimensions has its own characteristics and their outcomes need to be controlled (Chenhall 2003) and evaluated separately (Wang et al. 2016).

Particularly for CP, where doing ‘good’ for society is not directly associated with the main business purpose of a company (Kourula and Halme 2008), there is an ongoing discussion as to whether corporate donations only inflict costs on a company or if they may also lead to financial benefits (Liket and Simaens 2015; Gautier and Pache 2015).

Much research has focused on the question of whether philanthropic activities, besides being socially desirable, can be associated with economic success of companies and has empirically investigated the relationship between CP and corporate financial performance (CFP). Various studies have used stakeholder theory to argue that CP would indirectly be connected with financial benefits because it can improve the reputation of a company, foster customer relations, and increase employee motivation, thereby enhancing the firm’s overall business performance (Seifert et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2008; Lim 2010; Muller and Kraussl 2011a). While some empirical results supported these arguments (Tian 2012; Qiu 2013; Iatridis 2015), others did not (Seifert et al. 2003, 2004). Again others found a negative relationship (Balabanis et al. 1998; Gao et al. 2012), supporting arguments of agency theory that CP is used by managers for their personal benefit and has a negative relationship with a firm’s financial performance (Brammer and Millington 2005).

Although past meta-analyses have distinguished CP as a specific dimension of CSP (Orlitzky et al. 2003; Allouche and Laroche 2005; Margolis et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2015), these studies did not pay particular attention to different study designs, which would have allowed for causal interpretation within the CP subsample, and were unable to resolve confusion surrounding contradictory results.

# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…

In consequence, recently conducted literature reviews (Liket and Simaens 2015; Gautier and Pache 2015) came to the conclusion that the question of whether CP leads to higher CFP has not yet been answered. Gautier and Pache (2015) found that “many variations appear across firms, industries, and periods, as robust and widespread conclusions remain to be drawn” (Gautier and Pache 2015). At the same time, Liket and Simaens (2015) stated that “when studying the relationship between CP and CFP in a direct way, the evidence seems to paint a mixed picture.” In this context, our study intends to advance the discussion on business benefits of CP by providing a comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis of subgroups of studies investigating this phenomenon.

Using a meta-analysis approach (Hedges and Olkin 1985; Hunter and Schmidt 2004), we integrated the results of 45 empirical studies, including 183 effect sizes, on the relationship between CP and CFP. Based on a contingency perspective, we explore how different study design factors, such as variable measurement, sample characteristics, as well as controlled moderating variables, influence the results. Particularly, we focus on the implementation of temporal sequences in study designs, i.e. time-lagged measurement of variables, as only these results are valid for the interpretation of causal relationships (Mitchell and James 2001). As a consequence, our study helps to establish a status quo of a positive relationship between CP and subsequently measured CFP across a range of different study designs. More importantly, it moves the discussion away from the question if a relationship between CP and CFP exists towards the question how and when CP positively affects CFP by identifying aspects that beg closer examination. Furthermore, we highlight how the levers of control framework of Simons (1994) might help to explain the causal link between CP and CFP and adds another intersection to be explored by scholars of both CP and management control research fields.

After the introduction, the paper is set up as follows. The “theoretical background” section provides definitions of the analyzed variables, outlines the fundamental interrelations between them, and formulates research questions to investigate the influence of time-lagged variable measurement, study design factors, and methodological moderators on the CP–CFP relationship. The third section briefly explains the employed method with respect to the data sample, coding, and meta-analytical integration of study results. In the “results”, meta-analysis outcomes are presented for the general relationship between CP and CFP, and for the particular relationship of CP and subsequent CFP with respect to study design factors and moderating variables. The “discussion” section sums up findings regarding the posed research questions. Furthermore, limitations of this study and recommendations for further research are presented.

# Theoretical background

# The relationship between CP and CFP: Doing well by doing good?

Before discussing the relationship between CP and CFP, it is important to clarify what these terms represent in this study. Very few scholars which have addressed the topic of CP have offered clear definitions about their understanding of what CP exactly

F. Plewnia, E. Guenther

is (Gautier and Pache 2015). This might cause confusion about which activities are considered as part of CP. Madden et al. (2006) define CP as “the voluntary business giving of money, time or in-kind goods, without any direct commercial benefit, to one or more organizations whose core purpose is to benefit the community’s welfare”. This definition is consistent with definitions used by several other authors (Schwartz 1968; Godfrey 2005) and is taken as the basis of the research conducted within this study.

In the context of the CP literature, the question has been raised by many if ‘doing good’ in a societal sense is related to ‘doing well’ in financial terms (Griffin and Mahon 1997; Margolis et al. 2009). Doing well financially is commonly expressed by the term CFP (Hamann et al. 2013). CFP captures the “social and economic outcomes resulting from the interplay among an organization’s attributes, actions, and environment” (Combs et al. 2005) and is represented by indicators such as profit, sales growth, or market returns (Hamann et al. 2013).

There are many reasons that suggest a positive relationship between CP and CFP. On the one hand, with a healthy enterprise that generates considerable profits each year, decision makers can afford to give money to charity. If most capital is earmarked for retaining the enterprise’s profitable status and avoiding bankruptcy, there might be few resources, in the form of time or money, left to engage in philanthropic activities. For this reason, slack resource theory proposes that strong CFP represents an essential prerequisite of CP, suggesting a causal effect of CFP on CP (Adams and Hardwick 1998; Buchholtz et al. 1999; Seifert et al. 2003). On the other hand, several theoretical arguments which are mainly derived from stakeholder theory (Freeman 1984), and can also be based on ideas of Simons’ levers of controls framework (Simons 1994), propose that companies can benefit from engaging in CP, indicating a positive causal effect of CP on CFP.

Engaging with society by donating cash, in-kind goods, or employee worktime can improve an organization’s performance on several internal and external levels. Externally, philanthropic giving can enhance reputation. This might help to establish a more loyal customer base (Luo 2005), ensure the license to operate within communities (Lim 2010), and serve as a reputational insurance in case of negative events (Godfrey 2005). Furthermore, governmental and financial institutions might be more willing to support companies which are associated with strong community support (Ye and Zhang 2011).

Organizations also benefit from CP on the internal level. As Porter and Kramer (2002) describe, a business is unable to thrive without the right environment. This includes not only a community’s good will and infrastructure, but also its attractiveness for possible employees of the company. Companies need to attract a highly qualified and motivated workforce. Organizational values and belief systems (Simons 1994), which can be shaped and reinforced by mission statements, company CSR reports, as well as by corporate donations, can enhance employee identification and provide an enterprise with a competitive advantage to secure their access to these high-quality workers (Turban and Greening 1997; Balakrishnan et al. 2011; Arjalies and Mundy 2013). Moreover, employees within the company show higher job commitment and job performance when they feel that they are part of a company that believes in giving back to society (Ke et al. 2015). Finally, value systems supported by CSR and philanthropic

activities can provide opportunities for growth and innovation as, “in the absence of problems, belief systems motivate individuals to search for new ways of creating value” (Simons 1994).

Despite the aforementioned rationales for a positive relationship between CP and CFP, there are also some arguments that propose a negative association of CP and CFP. When comparing different CSR activities for their strategic motivation and the associated business success, Schaltegger and Burritt (2015) argue that CP is a reactionary form of CSR. As such, CP is “neither expected nor implemented to generate profits but to keep critics at bay” (p. 10) and will mainly cause costs instead of leading to economic benefits (Schaltegger and Burritt 2015). Furthermore, even when assuming that well-intended and strategically directed donations might have positive effects on a firm’s financial performance, agency theory suggest that managers (i.e. agents) may show opportunistic behavior when deciding over CP activities (Iatridis 2015). When not properly controlled by the shareholders (i.e. principals), managers may use firm resources to donate to causes which enhance their personal image instead of the company’s reputational capital (Navarro 1988; Amran et al. 2007; Cowan et al. 2013). These agency costs may outbalance potential benefits of CP and may lead to an overall negative association between CP and CFP.

However, the existence of a positive or a negative relationship between CP and CFP does not have to be exclusive. Wang et al. (2008) as well as Chen and Lin (2015) proposed and empirically verified an inverted u-shaped relationship. They suggest that negative effects of CP, as implied by agency theory, from a certain point on are greater than the benefits generated by gratifying the stakeholders. As a consequence, the financial net effect of charitable donations for companies is first positive, then levels out, and eventually turns negative (Wang et al. 2008).

While various studies have found empirical support for a positive relationship between CP and CFP (Hall and Rieck 1998; Su and He 2010; Tian 2012; Qiu 2013; Iatridis 2015), others have not (Seifert et al. 2003, 2004), and again others have even found negative relationships (Balabanis et al. 1998; Gao et al. 2012). Although the main purpose of this study is not to reaffirm the general link between CP and CFP but to take a closer look at different circumstances and study designs which affect this relationship, it is necessary to establish a starting point of our inquiry. This is why our research question 1 (RQ1) examines the existence of a generally positive relationship between CP and CFP across all study designs integrated within our meta-analysis.

# RQ1: Is there a positive relationship between CP and CFP?

# 2.2 Investigating causality with time-lagged measurements

When investigating the relationship between CP and CFP, it is important to keep in mind that a mere statistical association of two variables does not allow for any conclusion about causality (Mitchell and James 2001; Van der Stede 2014). The relationship between CP and CFP could be a result of a causal effect of CFP on CP, i.e. companies with stronger financial performance give more because they can, or of a causal effect of CP on CFP, i.e. positive effects of CP on reputation and employee motivation lead to higher CFP, or both. To find evidence that allows for an inference of causation,

F. Plewnia, E. Guenther

Researchers can measure variables in a temporal sequence by introducing a time lag. If, for example, CFP is measured 1 year after the corporate donation amount was measured (subsequent measurement), a statistical correlation between the two measures can plausibly be interpreted to imply that CP has an effect on CFP. If both indicators are assessed at the same time (concurrent measurement), on the other hand, no causal relationship can be inferred from the results (Bausch and Pils 2009).

To take implemented time lags into consideration, CFP indicators are assessed as to whether they are measured prior, concurrently, or subsequently to the CP indicator. The consideration of these time lagged measurements within all study designs and across all subgroups of effect sizes is a key aspect within this study. The relationship we want to focus on is between CP and subsequently measured CFP to assess the causal effect of CP on the latter. The existence of this effect would also suggest that CP activities need to be integrated into management control systems to exploit positive outcomes of CP, such as stakeholder reputation and employee motivation, and limit negative consequences in the form of managerial opportunism.

Besides the temporal sequence of measured events, another important aspect that needs to be considered is the temporal distance of indicator measurement (Mitchell and James 2001). As positive reputation and employee motivation, representing the main mediators for the effect of CP on CFP, can be considered as inducing mid- or long-term effects, a time frame of at least 1 year seems adequate. Conveniently, when studies investigate this relationship and consider the temporal sequence for these two variables, they usually depend on archival data provided on a yearly basis and, thus, implement a sufficient time lag of at least 1 year.

If we want to lead a more specific discussion on two variables’ relationship including causality effects, we need to differentiate empirical studies that considered the temporal sequence of variable measurement. Therefore, based on RQ1, our research question 2 (RQ2) focuses on differences in findings for prior, concurrent, and subsequent measurement of CFP in relation to CP.

# RQ2: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that used different temporal sequences of variable measurement?

# 2.3 Study design factors

Even if a relationship between CP and subsequent CFP can be empirically shown to allow for the inference of causality, the important question of the conditions under which this relationship holds remains. After all, the existence of a positive or negative relationship might depend on differences concerning the study design and the context of respective CP activities. To account for these differences within a meta-analysis, empirical results can be sorted into subgroups according to their study design attributes and contextual factors. This kind of subgroup analysis might shed some light on questions about the conditions under which CP can have a significant influence on CFP. As a consequence, it needs to be investigated how the relationship is influenced by different study designs. While RQ3 postulates the general question on this issue, the following subquestions demand more specific answers for different subgroups of studies.

# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…

# RQ3: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to study design?

# Operationalization of CFP

An important and usual attribute to start with is the measurement of CFP (Combs et al. 2005; Hamann et al. 2013). Other studies investigating the relationship between CFP and CSP or corporate environmental performance (CEP) have mainly focused on the differentiation of accounting-based indicators, e.g., return on assets (ROA) or return on equity (ROE), and market-based measures, e.g., stock market returns or market risk values (Orlitzky et al. 2003; Allouche and Laroche 2005; Margolis et al. 2009; Endrikat et al. 2014). Following these approaches, the same classification is introduced for CFP measures in this study. Earlier meta-analyses have found that the correlations between CSP and CFP are stronger when using accounting-based rather than market-based measures of CFP (Orlitzky et al. 2003; Margolis et al. 2009). The argument which was used to explain these findings is presented by Wood and Jones (1995), who argue that “there is no theory to explain why stockholders would or would not prefer a company that gives one percent of pre-tax earnings to charity […]”. Building on these findings, research question 3a asks:

# RQ3a: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to the employed CFP indicator?

# Operationalization of CP

Just as there exist different possibilities to measure CFP, several distinct indicators have been used to represent the philanthropic activities of firms. While some have measured CP by a dummy variable, evaluating the overall existence of charitable donations (Hall and Rieck 1998; Qiu 2013), others have assessed the total amount of donations made (Patten 2008; Wang and Qian 2011), and again others computed the percentage of donated amounts relative to total assets, pre-tax income, or sales (Jia and Zhang 2014; Chen et al. 2015; Iatridis 2015). Generosity in the form of relative donations could be more important to customers and other stakeholders than the absolute amount of donations (Patten 2008) or the mere existence of donations. Furthermore, according to the theory of an inverted u-shaped relationship between CP and CFP (Wang et al. 2008; Chen et al. 2015), one could expect that the initial participation in donation programs yields higher CFP benefits than ever-increasing sums of charitable donations. This is why we ask whether a positive relationship persists for these different types of CP indicators.

# RQ3b: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to the employed CP indicator?

Besides the general indicator measuring CP, there are more aspects to be considered about the charitable donation indicators that have been assessed for empirical analyses. The first aspect concerns the donation medium that was captured. According to the definition of CP, charitable donations can be made in the form of cash, in-kind goods, or volunteered time (Madden et al. 2006). These different forms of resources donated to society might be perceived differently by stakeholders. Company volunteering programs, which temporarily release company paid workers from their business duties in order to work for social causes, can increase motivation of employees and foster brand identification of customers (Jones 2010; Veleva et al. 2012; Mattila and Hanks).

F. Plewnia, E. Guenther

In-kind donations, which include the donation of company products, generate a marketing effect and simultaneously make it possible to write off excess inventory (Gao et al. 2012). As a result of these additional benefits of specific kinds of donations, it is expected that these might influence the found relationship but that the positive relationship holds for all subgroups.

# RQ3c: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to the donation medium included in the CP measure?

The second aspect that is notably different about the type of CP evaluated within empirical analyses concerns the time horizon of the donation. Whereas many studies examined continuous donation efforts over periods of 1 year or longer (Diltz 1995; Balabanis et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2015; Iatridis 2015), others focused on donations made directly at or after a specific event, mostly natural disasters (Muller and Kraussl 2011b; Gao et al. 2012; Qiu 2013). The special context and increased media attention of disaster relief donations might influence the impact on CFP, which is why we intend to investigate RQ3d.

# RQ3d: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to the time horizon of donations included in the CP measure?

Sample data Other contextual factors that could influence the study outcomes are the country and the year in which the data was gathered. Because of important cultural, economic, institutional, and legal differences between developed and developing countries, it is argued that the relationship between CP and CFP might differ within these two contexts (Su and He 2010; Ye and Zhang 2011). Arguments and respective findings have gone in both directions. On the one hand, in developing countries with greater market inefficiencies, CP can help to improve political connections and protect property rights (Su and He 2010). On the other hand, markets are more transparent and CSR awareness is said to be higher in developed countries. This leads to higher visibility of companies among more demanding stakeholders and could increase the influence of CP efforts on CFP (Ye and Zhang 2011; Wang and Qian 2011). Furthermore, especially in China where political affiliation is a more salient issue than in other countries, managers might use donations to enhance their political connections on a personal level instead of benefiting the company. Due to these higher agency costs assumed in countries like China, we need to ask the question:

# RQ3e: Does the relationship hold for subgroups of studies that differed with regard to sample country?

Regarding the year of the investigation, it can be expected that found relationships have become stronger over time for several reasons. First, study designs are generally assumed to improve over time to yield stronger relationships (Combs et al. 2011). Furthermore, for this particular meta-analysis, as the differentiated analysis of specific CSR dimensions has become more important over recent years (Wang et al. 2016), more studies are expected to exist for recent decades, implying more robust meta-analysis results with growing sample sizes. Finally, due to digital technology and extended non-financial reporting, growing transparency between stakeholders and companies might have increased the impact of strategic philanthropy for business and

society (Porter and Kramer 2002; Saiia et al. 2003; Gao et al. 2012; Rangan et al. 2015)

# 2.4 Methodological moderators

When investigating the relationship between CP and CFP, it is important to consider that there are also other variables, such as firm size, advertising intensity, or ownership structures, which might have an impact on the measured relationship. These moderating variables should be held constant or controlled for when measuring a relationship and are referred to as control variables. To account for control variables, their effect can be eliminated by using partial correlations, which hold the moderating variables constant and measure the ‘true’ relationship between CP and CFP. A number of moderators have been considered by existing studies, including firm size, industry effects, advertising intensity, R&D spending, past financial performance, or public ownership (Balabanis et al. 1998; Lev et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2015).

Before taking a closer look at the mentioned control variables individually, it is an interesting question as to whether the overall relationship between CP and subsequent CFP changes if only partial correlations are considered. A number of studies have already included control variables into their measurements, but their results cannot readily be mixed with bivariate effect sizes, so these are investigated as a separate sample within our study. Based on the arguments made above, a significant correlation is still expected when the effects of other variables are partialed out and the ‘true’ relationship is measured.

# RQ4a: Does the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations in general?

Besides the integration of all partial correlation coefficients controlling for different sets of control variables, these can also be analyzed separately. For example, numerous studies controlled for firm size, which has an effect on public visibility and is, thus, suggested to influence the CP–CFP relationship (Balabanis et al. 1998; Chen et al. 2015; Iatridis 2015). Furthermore, within distinct industries, different levels of CP or profitability are common and shareholder returns vary, which is why industry effects should be controlled for (Seifert et al. 2004).

Advertising is an important way to create intangible assets, such as firm reputation or brand identification. As these can have a considerable impact on future firm performance and at the same time are associated with CP, advertising intensity is an important variable to be taken into consideration when evaluating CP business impacts (Wang et al. 2008). Furthermore, Wang and Qian (2011) argue that stakeholders are unlikely to respond positively to the CP activities of companies if these failed to fulfill their basic financial needs in the past. The past financial performance, hence, influences the impact of CP on future CFP and should be considered as a control variable. Another important moderating variable is public ownership. Especially in China, where many firms are partly owned by the state, it is argued that private firms need to be more strategic in directing their donations to generate public goodwill (Zhang et al. 2010; Qiu 2013).

# F. Plewnia, E. Guenther

arguments, all of the mentioned variables are expected to have a significant impact on the relationship. Consequently, it should be examined whether the relationship holds for subgroups of studies that controlled for the respective moderators.

# RQ4b:

Does the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations controlling for firm size?

# RQ4c:

Does the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations controlling for industry?

# RQ4d:

Does the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations controlling for advertising intensity?

# RQ4e:

Does the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations controlling for past CFP?

Does the relationship hold for studies that calculated partial correlations controlling for public ownership?

# 3 Method

# 3.1 Sample

To find studies on the topic of CP, we used the search words (corpor* OR company* OR business OR enterprise* OR firm*) AND (donat* OR philanthrop* OR “charitable giving” OR volunteer*). Additionally, wherever possible, we employed the complementary search terms (data OR empirical OR test OR statistical OR finding* OR result* OR evidence) to narrow down the search results to quantitative studies (David and Han 2004). This search equation was applied to scan the databases Emerald Insight and ScienceDirect as well as a number of other databases, namely Academic Source Complete, Business Source Complete, EconLit with Full Text, E-Journals, and GreenFILE, which were accessed through the host platform EBSCOhost®. From the database result lists, only the articles or books which had conducted quantitative empirical analyses about the relationship between CP and CFP were included in the sample. The database research for literature was completed by the end of May 2015. Furthermore, the authors of recently conducted literature reviews (Liket and Simaens 2015; Gautier and Pache 2015) were contacted and kindly provided support in contributing additional articles to the final sample. Including cross references identified within the found literature, an initial dataset of 69 publications was selected for further analysis.

To be included in the final sample of studies used for the meta-analysis, the studies had to report empirical results that were convertible into r correlation coefficients with the help of respective transformation formulas (Greene 2000; Lipsey and Wilson 2001; Rosenthal and DiMatteo 2001). Furthermore, as recommended by Dalton and Dalton (2005), correlations had to rely on a sample size of at least 30 to be included into the meta-analysis. In case of incomplete data (e.g. no sample size reported), studies were removed from the sample. After applying these selection criteria, a final sample of 45 publications provided the database for this study. Observations and reported results of the relevant empirical analyses were distinguished according to the employed sample, statistical relationship (i.e. bivariate or partial), applied time lag, and operationalization.

# 3.2 Coding and integration of effect sizes

Besides the captured information regarding effect size statistic and sample size, each effect size result was coded for the study design factors outlined in the “Theoretical background” section. The first, and for this study most important, distinction of the study results was made regarding the time lag that was used for the measurement of CP and CFP variables. Time lags can be used to imply causal relationships between two variables. To take implemented time lags into consideration, CFP indicators are categorized as being measured prior, concurrently, or subsequently to the CP indicator (Bausch and Pils 2009). Furthermore, according to the employed statistical method, an effect size was captured as describing either a bivariate or a partial relationship.

The CFP indicator was represented by accounting (e.g. ROA) or market-based measures (e.g. stock return). Hybrid measures such as Tobin’s Q or earnings per share (EPS) were assigned to both groups for the subgroup analysis of the CFP indicator. In all other cases, they entered the analysis only as one effect size. The CP indicator was assessed by a donation dummy, the total amount of donation, or relative donations (e.g. percentage of pre-tax earnings). Furthermore, the inclusion of only cash, in-kind, or volunteered time donations into the CP measure, as well as the time horizon of the donation (i.e., continuous or disaster relief donations), were coded. The country of origin and observation year of the sample data was also captured. Additionally, the partial relationship effect sizes were coded for the moderating control variables they had included in the analysis. For a more detailed overview of coding categories and codes, supplementary material from the authors is available upon request.

To integrate the empirical results of the relevant studies, all reported effect sizes were transformed to r product momentum correlation coefficients using the respective transformation formulas (Greene 2000; Lipsey and Wilson 2001; Rosenthal and DiMatteo 2001). Whenever several observations were made within one study, we had to decide whether the measured effect sizes could be treated as independent from each other. While treated as independent, each effect size could enter the meta-analysis individually without introducing a significant bias to the results (Hunter and Schmidt 2004). In case effect sizes from one study could not be considered as independent, e.g. when observing the same sample and variables with different regression models, they had to be integrated into a single value or only one of the dependent effect sizes had to be chosen to be entered into the meta-analysis (Geyskens et al. 2009). Following the recommendations and examples of other meta-analyses in the field of management, effect sizes from one study were treated as independent as long as they clearly used different samples, different time lags, or different operationalization for the CP or CFP variable (Bijmolt and Pieters 2001; Orlitzky et al. 2003; Dalton and Dalton 2005; Carney et al. 2011).

However, when a study reported the results of several regression models with changing moderating variables but identical samples, only the effect size from the model

F. Plewnia, E. Guenther

with the highest R2 was used. When a study used summarizing variables, for example, by computing the factor of other variables (Balabanis et al. 1998), these values were not considered in this meta-analysis, but only the individual variables they were derived from. When a cumulated abnormal stock market return was measured over several days separately for the same sample, only the cumulated value of the last day was included into the analysis as it is suggested that the positive effect is stronger over longer terms (Diltz 1995; Gao et al. 2012).

To consider measurement error, the reliability of the dependent and independent variable was defined to be 0.8, as recommended by Dalton and Dalton (2005), and the correlations were adjusted accordingly (Hunter and Schmidt 2004). The corrected correlations r were integrated using Hedges and Olkin’s (1985) approach of converting correlations to Fisher’s z and weighting them by their inversed variance. Confidence intervals were constructed at the 90% level and significance p was reported at the 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels. Homogeneity was tested by calculating Q-statistics, and Q-between (QB) was used to assess if the heterogeneity between subgroups is explained by the regarding study design factor, in which case a significant p-value is reported for QB (Hedges and Olkin 1985). Calculated mean effect sizes rm are all based on the random effects model (Lipsey and Wilson 2001). Following the recommendation of Dalton and Dalton (2005), subgroup analysis was only performed with a minimum of three effect sizes.

When conducting meta-analyses, publication bias, also referred to as the file drawer problem, is a severe issue which should not be neglected (Geyskens et al. 2009). While journals tend to focus on articles with significant research results to support or reject certain hypotheses, file drawers might be full with null results which never get published (Rosenthal 1979).

To account for possibly unpublished studies which might have altered the results, the fail-safe k was calculated based on Rosenthal’s (1979) file drawer method. The fail-safe k indicates the number of studies with a mean effect size of zero that would have been necessary to yield an insignificant (p = 0.05) summary effect. All the computations for integrating effect sizes, identifying confidence intervals, and calculating heterogeneity indicators were performed with the help of the software program Comprehensive Meta-Analysis.

# 4 Results

# 4.1 The causal relationship between CP and CFP

The analysis of the overall relationship between CP and CFP was based on all the bivariate effect sizes assessing CP–CFP correlations and yielded a significantly positive summary effect of 0.094 (k = 100, n = 132,319, p < 0.001). When taking into account the file drawer problem by calculating the fail-safe k, these results seemed robust. An additional number of 59,027 null-effect observations would have been needed to make the result insignificant (p = 0.05). This result enables us to answer RQ1 with a clear yes and establish the positive relationship between CP and CFP as the starting point for further elaborations of this study (Table 1).

To take a closer look at this relationship and answer RQ2, the sample of effect sizes was split up into subgroups according to the temporal sequence of time measurement. First, it is important to acknowledge that the introduced time lag has a significant impact on the yielded results (Q B = 7.93, p = 0.019). The integrated effect size based on concurrent measurements of CP and CFP shows the strongest relationship between the two variables (r m = 0.136, k = 47, n = 53,549, p < 0.001). However, no conclusions on a causal relationship can be drawn from this result. When looking at subsequent measurement of CFP, we find a significantly positive correlation coefficient (r m = 0.082, k = 34, n = 33,300, p = 0.002), implying that CP indeed has a positive impact on subsequent CFP, which would suggest the implementation of CP into management control systems. When examining the relationship of prior CFP to CP, on the other hand, no significant relationship can be found (r m = 0.007, k = 19, n = 45,470, p = 0.882).

Before analyzing further results, it is important to note that correlations based on concurrent CP and CFP measurements do not imply any causal relationship between these two variables. For these relationships, it is unclear which indicator influences the other. Bearing this in mind, research questions are answered based only on relationships which included a time lag in the measurement. Accordingly, the results presented in Tables 2 and 3 are exclusively derived from subsequent measurements of CFP variables. However, for the sake of completeness and to set further ground for theoretical discussions, results including concurrent measurements are reported within the text.

# 4.2 Study design factors

Operationalization of CFP Results of the performed subgroup analysis according to different study design factors are presented in Table 2. The first study design factor which was assumed to influence the relationship between CP and subsequent CFP was the CFP indicator, represented either by accounting or by market-based measures (RQ3a). Our meta-analysis results indicate that there is no significant difference between subgroups which employed either one or the other operationalization of CFP (Q B = 0.305, p = 0.581). The positive relationship holds for both accounting (r m = 0.061, k = 14, n = 21,752, p = 0.028) and market-based measures (r m = 0.085, k = 24, n = 22,102, p = 0.016). When concurrent measurements were

included into the analysis, the relationship for accounting measures (r m = 0.129, k = 48, n = 65, 272, p < 0.001), just as for market measures (r m = 0.074, k = 47, n = 50, 136, p < 0.001), remain significantly positive. In this case, however, there is a significant difference between the two subgroups, with accounting measures showing a stronger relationship (Q B = 3.869, p = 0.049). This result supposes a stronger bidirectional relationship for accounting measures and might explain the findings of earlier meta-analyses, which suggested that the relationship is stronger when accounting measures are used (Orlitzky et al. 2003; Margolis et al. 2009). Nevertheless, the latter results are not to be used to draw a conclusion on the causal relationship between CP and CFP.

Operationalization of CP Just as with the measure of the CFP variable, the indicator representing CP was expected to have an impact on the CP–CFP relationship. It was questioned whether the positive relationship would hold for the use of a donation dummy, the absolute donation amount, or the relative donation amount as a CP measure (RQ3b). Again, our meta-analysis showed that there is no significant dif

ference between the three assessed measurements of CP (Q B = 1.46, p = 0.483). Regardless of the applied indicator, signiﬁcantly positive relationships were found for donation dummy (r m = 0.234, k = 3, n = 373, p = 0.078), donation amount (r m = 0.073, k = 17, n = 10,570, p = 0.040), and relative donations (r m = 0.070, k = 14, n = 22,357, p = 0.085). When concurrent relationships are included, the result remains the same. There is no signiﬁcant difference (Q B = 2.93, p = 0.233) and all indicators show signiﬁcantly positive relationships between CP and CFP (r m = 0.095, k = 8, n = 5,095, p = 0.001; r m = 0.152, k = 37, n = 18,537, p < 0.001; and r m = 0.090, k = 36, n = 63,217, p < 0.001, respectively).

Regarding the donation medium included in the donation measure, there was a limitation of the conducted analysis regarding the assessment of corporate volunteering. Unfortunately, there were not enough effect sizes which included volunteering time into their CP measure to calculate a separate effect, maybe because organized volunteering is a rather new trend. Nevertheless, the relationship was found to be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the inclusion of in-kind donations in the measurement (Q B = 6.94, p = 0.031). The effect on the relationship, however, was the reverse of our expectations. Donating only cash led to a signiﬁcantly positive relationship (r m = 0.152, k = 7, n = 492, p = 0.001), while including in-kind donations did not yield a positive effect (r m = 0.027, k = 11, n = 9,032, p = 0.176). Adding concurrent relationships to the results supports these findings in showing a significant difference (Q B = 7.84., p = 0.02) and a stronger relationship for only cash.

Summing up the results from the previous section with regard to RQ3, we found that the positive relationship of CP and CFP holds across a wide range of study designs and for most investigated subgroups. However, there are several groups in which the relation did not hold and further examination might be necessary in the future. Furthermore, we found that the distinction of time-lagged measurement also plays a crucial role for subgroup analysis and can provide further ground for theorization.

out (rm = 0.171, k = 30, n = 58, 023, p = 0.02). The fail-safe k of 1164 effect sizes (p = 0.05) for this result again indicated the absence of a possible publication bias. When the sample is extended to contain concurrent and subsequent time lag measurements jointly, this relationship persists (rm = 0.121, k = 83, n = 96, 687, p = 0.002).

This finding could not be confirmed for all investigated subgroups. However, for each of the included control variables the calculated mean correlation coefficients remains positive, with significant relationships for advertising intensity (rm = 0.098, k = 4, n = 13, 568, p = 0.025) and public ownership (rm = 0.129, k = 6, n = 10, 834, p < 0.001), and with insignificant results for firm size and industry effects, which were both controlled by the same subsample of studies (rm = 0.139, k = 24, n = 41, 047, p = 0.128), as well as past financial performance (rm = 0.101, k = 5, n = 8, 243, p = 0.120). When concurrent relationships were added to the sample, all the subgroups which had controlled for one of these variables showed significantly positive relationships, except for the subsample which had controlled for public ownership (rm = 0.083, k = 9, n = 16, 840, p = 0.102).

# 5 Discussion

# 5.1 Summary and interpretation of findings

All findings regarding our research questions are discussed in the following sections and summarized in Table 4. Additionally, following the idea of evidence based management (Barends et al. 2014), we deduct exemplary consequences for management control from the results yielded by our meta-analysis. Consequently, for each subgroup where a significant positive relationship was found, Table 4 outlines conclusions for the integration of CP into management control systems.

RQ1—general CP–CFP relationship Based on a sample of 100 bivariate effect sizes, the general existence of a positive relationship between CP and CFP was confirmed by our meta-analysis results. This relationship formed the foundation of our study and was tested for its dependency on different study designs.

RQ2—time-lagged measurements The first and most important question that we posed was whether the positive relationship would hold when temporal sequences of variable measurement were considered in a way that allows for the implication of a causal relationship between CP and CFP. The subgroup of effect sizes that measured CFP prior to CP, which might have shown empirical evidence for the slack resources theory, did not show a significant positive relationship. Studies that used concurrent and subsequent measurement of CFP, on the other hand, did show a significant positive relationship. This finding supports arguments of stakeholder theory and the idea that CP as a part of organizational belief and value systems can positively influence a company’s financial performance (Simons 1994). Furthermore, this provides arguments for the stronger implementation of CP into all four of Simons levers of management control (Simons 1994).

# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…

# RQ3—study design factors

Contrary to previous results of other meta-analyses (Orlitzky et al. 2003; Margolis et al. 2009), the relationship between CP and CFP was not found to differ between subgroups using either accounting or market-based measures (RQ3a). This finding suggests that stockholders either indeed appreciate the reputational capital built by CP or they perceive giving to charity as a positive signal of strong financial performance. Either way, stockholders positively acknowledge CP activities. Similarly, internal accounting performance measures show a positive effect on CFP.

Besides the different possibilities of measuring CFP, it was also assessed if the indicator used to measure CP changed the results. First of all, the relationship remained significantly positive regardless of the CP indicator and it made no significant difference if CP was measured by a donation dummy, absolute donations, or relative donations (RQ3b). Furthermore, the two lettered subgroups of studies measuring CP with absolute or relative donations showed about the same strength in its relationship to CFP. A possible explanation for this finding is the limited perception of some stakeholders, e.g. customers or local communities. These might very well perceive the absolute amount of donations made by companies, but setting these donation amounts in relation to total firm resources seems to be beyond the means of the average customer. Following this line of thought, large amounts of charitable donations can cause large amounts of positive public attention and can hence generate a positive CFP impact on the same level as generosity in terms of relative donations. Finally, supporting the idea of an inverted u-shaped relationship between CP and CFP, a quite small sample indicates that initial participation in CP activities might have a stronger impact on CFP than ever increasing donations.

With regard to the donation medium included in the CP measurement (RQ3c), and contrary to our expectations, results indicated that the inclusion of in-kind donations did yield less business benefits compared to the donation of only cash. A possible explanation for this finding could be that managerial opportunism, i.e. agency costs, are a greater problem with in-kind donations because they are less controlled than philanthropic cash flows. In this context, management control boundary systems might play a crucial role in directing donations according to the company’s purposes (Simons 1994). Moreover, stakeholders might perceive cash donations to community purposes as more genuine compared to in-kind donations of company products.

While a positive relationship was empirically shown for studies investigating continuous CP efforts, the subgroup of studies exploring disaster relief donations did not show a significant relationship (RQ3d). A reason for the fact that the positive relationship does not hold for effect sizes which measured disaster relief donations might be that most of the studies in this subsample focused on stock market values a few days after the incident. Medium and long-term effects of CP cannot adequately be captured by this approach, which is why no significant relationship was found.

With regard to the country where the data was gathered, results did not confirm that in developed countries (i.e. the USA) the relationship between CP and CFP was significantly different from the found relationship in developing countries (i.e. China; RQ3e). However, while in the USA the relationship was significantly positive, in China it was not, mainly due to the great heterogeneity of integrated effect sizes from Chinese samples. A possible explanation for the wide range of results.

# F. Plewnia, E. Guenther

for China could be that within the country there exist regions with large differences regarding their degrees of development, respective CSR expectations, and market inefficiencies (Su and He 2010; Wang and Qian 2011). Furthermore, state or private ownership of companies might play an important role for the wide spread of results for China (Zhang et al. 2010; Qiu 2013) as agency costs might be greater for companies with state affiliations because managers make donations to increase their personal standing instead of company value (Jia and Zhang 2014). Filtering the studies according to their time of data acquisition showed that a significant positive relationship could only be assessed for the last decade, which supports the assumption that the relationship has strengthened over time (RQ3f). Still, in the context of this finding it should be considered that the majority of empirical research was based on data from the decade 2000–2010 and very little data was available on previous decades.

# RQ4—methodological moderators

Not to include the influence of moderating variables into such an analysis could easily compromise the validity of any findings (McWilliams and Siegel 2000). To eliminate the upward bias derived from CP-correlated variables which also influence CFP, such as advertising intensity or firm size, the effect of these variables can be controlled by partial correlations. It was found that, when only partial instead of bivariate correlations were analyzed, the relationship between CP and subsequent CFP was still significantly positive (RQ4a). However, we found mixed results when different control variables were considered individually (RQ4b–f). The relationships of the subgroups of studies that controlled for firm size, industry effects, or past financial performance, although remaining positive, were no longer significant. To resolve doubts concerning this matter, future research should always include the mentioned control variables into the analysis.

Summing up our meta-analysis results, the following can be stated. Regarding the recent suggestions of Schaltegger and Burritt (2015) and arguments of agency theory, no evidence was found suggesting that CP would mainly inflict costs and, as a consequence, negatively influence CFP. On the contrary, a statistically significant positive relationship between CP and subsequent CFP was found, which allows for the interpretation of a causal effect of CP on CFP. Additionally, this positive effect was found to hold for the majority of study designs that were used for its investigation. Although the relationship was not significantly positive for every subgroup analyzed, there was not a single case in which a negative relationship was found. Thus, we could identify no particular context in which CP would harm a company’s financial situation, but often found evidence for the opposite justifying a stronger attention to CP in the context of management control systems.

# 5.2 Limitations and further research

The goal of this study was to provide empirical evidence for the existence of a causal relationship between CP and CFP and only time-lagged measurements were valid for this purpose (Mitchell and James 2001). Although the inclusion of concurrent relationships, which in all cases supported our results, would have considerably enlarged our sample size, research questions were answered based only on observations which

# The benefits of doing good: a meta-analysis of corporate…

had introduced a time lag into their study designs. As a consequence, significant statistical relationships were found which allowed inferring a positive effect of CP on CFP. We encourage future research to construct their methodological design according to the intended findings and to employ time-lagged variables when investigating causal relationships. This would allow theoretical arguments to be founded on a more solid ground and future meta-analyses studies to draw on even more extensive samples and conduct more detailed analyses. Particularly, future research should thrive to close gaps of knowledge that could not be thoroughly investigated in this study for a lack of data. Specific attention should be paid to the following aspects.

First of all, relative donations as a possible indicator of CP were often measured in relation to pre-tax-earnings, sales, or some other accounting variable. However, donations in comparison to industry standards or competitors as well as donation growth should be established as alternative CP measures to eliminate cross-lagged effects between CP and CFP. Although some studies controlled for industry effects and past CFP within their sample, this should be the standard for all studies investigating the CP–CFP relationship. Similarly, including donation growth as a CP indicator, on which almost no data was found within our sample, should become a common practice. Moreover, motivated by the considerable number of studies which did not indicate if they included in-kind donations in their measurement, and the almost non-existence of studies which have addressed the CFP impacts of employee volunteering, it is recommended that more attention is addressed to these issues in future research.

The most important issue which could not be extensively addressed by our meta-analysis is a possible inverted u-shape relationship between CP and subsequent CFP, implying that there is an optimal level of donations (Wang et al. 2008; Chen and Lin 2015). In this context, theories which propose positive and negative relationships between CP and subsequent CFP might coexist with one effect influencing the other. Unfortunately, there were not enough observations to conduct any meta-analytical analysis to evaluate this u-shape theory. However, this might be an interesting and important direction of further empirical investigation.

Furthermore, our study design did not allow for the discernment of different kinds of direct, indirect, and cross-lagged effects between CP and CFP. As a consequence, although sample subgroups were used to test for the relationship in different contexts and a starting point for more detailed analyses was established, the theoretical lines of argumentation remain very presumptive. To go beyond establishing if a causal relationship exists and explore more soundly how this causal effect is achieved, further investigation of moderating and mediating variables is necessary. Numerous studies have already investigated the impact of CP on corporate reputation, on consumer perception, and on employee motivation. Integrating and advancing research on these mediators could excellently complement and expand the findings which were made by our meta-analysis.

Finally, the integration of ideas from management control system literature into this field of study could provide a fruitful ground for rich discussions on the mechanisms of how and under which circumstances CP might have an effect on CFP and company success. While CP activities can generally be seen to represent company belief and value systems, which attract and motivate employees, boundary systems

F. Plewnia, E. Guenther

might be necessary to restrict managerial opportunism from leading to agency costs (Simons 1994). Moreover, as stakeholders’ interests represent an increasingly important part of a company’s goal dimensions, it seems to be a reasonable step to include social activities, such as CP, in diagnostic and interactive management control systems which are used to steer financial and non-financial outcomes and might help to align both interests (Chenhall 2003). This becomes all the more relevant for companies where CP, leading to community welfare, is not only a strategic instrument for shared value creation but a desired outcome of their business activities (Godfrey 2005).

# 6 Conclusion

At the beginning of this study, we raised the question of whether CP was a form of CSR that could indeed yield economic benefits for companies. Our meta-analysis results found that, in addition to a general positive relationship between CP and CFP, there exists a statistically significant relationship between CP and subsequent CFP, which allows for the implication of a causal relationship. This finding suggests a stronger implementation of CP into management control systems to steer and understand the positive influence of CP on CFP.

This relationship remained significantly positive throughout a variety of subgroup analyses. Nevertheless, integration of effect sizes in a number of subgroups also showed insignificant relationships between CP and subsequent CFP. Consequently, future research should pay careful attention to their study design when comparing and interpreting findings. Especially time-lagged measurements should be implemented when seeking to investigate causality. Furthermore, control variables should be included to negate any doubts about the validity of results.

By finding a positive effect of CP on CFP, but pointing out how different conditions might affect this relationship, this study provides a starting point for investigating how and under which circumstances CP can positively influence CFP. In this context, the possible existence of an inverted u-shaped relationship, closer examinations of mediating variables, and integrating perspectives from management control literature are suggested as promising new avenues for extending our understanding of this relationship. Finally, our study has shown that the positive impact of CP on CFP clearly dominates possible negative effects across a wide range of study designs and sample contexts. As a consequence, the notion that CP only inflicts costs needs to be finally left behind as it might mistakenly direct decision-makers to abandon their CP activities. It is important to make clear that CP can make an important contribution to both society’s well-being and a corporation’s economic success.

# Does CSR practice pay off in East Asian firms? A meta-analytic investigation

Mingjun Hou1 & Heng Liu2 & Peihua Fan3 & Zelong Wei1

# Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015

# Abstract

Academics and practitioners have long wondered whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) practice is beneficial for Asian firms. To better understand the relationships between CSR and business performance, we use meta-analytical techniques based on 31,773 East Asian firms reported in 28 empirical studies to provide cumulative evidence for the value of CSR. Meta-analytic results indicate a general positive association between CSR and business performance. We find that environmental CSR has a stronger impact than social CSR on business performance, and that CSR practice has a stronger positive effect on operational performance than on financial performance. Further meta-analytic evidence indicates that several moderating issues explain significant variances in the effect size across studies, including economic development stage (developed vs. developing), firm size (SMEs vs. non-SMEs), organizational form (public vs. private), and measurement methods (archival data vs. self-report). Moreover, we find that CSR importance in East Asia has not varied over the past 15 years. We conclude with theoretical contributions and practical implications.

understanding CSR in Asia (i.e., Scholtens & Kang, 2012) but has found controversial results regarding CSR effects on performance. CSR in Asia has been positively (Cheung, Tan, Ahn, & Zhang, 2010; Choi, Kwak, & Choe, 2010; Cole, Elliott, & Shimamoto, 2006; Oh, Chang, & Martynow, 2011), negatively (Li, & Zhang, 2010), and non-significantly (Cao, 2011) related to performance. CSR performance impacts also have been found to depend on contingent factors (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012) or performance indicators (Allouche & Laroche, 2005). The inconclusive results may stem from the failure to consider contingencies, inadequate measurement issues, and insufficient data (Lee, 2008).

The purpose of this study is to extend CSR research in contexts outside of the Western world and to ascertain the relationship between CSR and business performance of East Asian firms.1 We aim to clarify the issue by conducting an updated meta-analysis of the relationship to answer three salient questions. First, debates are ongoing as to whether it is worthwhile to pay attention to societal demands, so we question CSR effectiveness in the East Asian context by asking: How does CSR relate to business performance in East Asian firms? Second, to answer demands for investigating additional contingencies in the CSR–performance link (Barnett & Salomon, 2012), we ask: Is the relationship between CSR and business performance in East Asia moderated by economic development (developed vs. developing), and company attributes (industry type, size, and form)? Third, we recognize that academics are unsure about how CSR should be measured (Dahlsrud, 2008). Consistent with Dixon-Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand, and Romi (2012), we classify CSR measurement modes into two categories: archival and self-report. We ask: Does the mode for measuring CSR in Asian research matter to our focal relationship?

We undertook this study for several critical reasons. First, both Western and local businessmen are concerned about differences between Asian and Western CSR practices and their impacts (Baughn, Bodie, & Mclntosh, 2007; Noronha, Tou, Cynthia, & Guan, 2013). Thus we study whether CSR is profitable in East Asia by combining signaling theory and the institutional theory. Second, we respond to calls for understanding institutional and other contingent factors of the CSR–performance link (Barnett & Salomon, 2012; Margolis & Walsh, 2003; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001) by investigating various moderators: economic development, industry level, firm size, firm form, and measurement issues. Third, the growing number of empirical studies regarding CSR in East Asia motivates us to extend beyond traditional narrative reviews and conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis (Hendges & Olkin, 1985; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Based on meta-analytical techniques, we found 28 primary studies published between 2001 and 20152 that focus on Asian CSR practices and report CSR–performance relation statistics. We believe the time scope is appropriate to focus, review, and explore the focal relations in this unique East Asian setting.

Our research contributes to CSR literature in several ways. First, previous research was limited to CSR samples mostly in Western countries. In contrast, we explore CSR in East Asia by considering both categories of CSR and the measurement of performance. The meta-analysis results have helped us cross validate insights from different studies and reconcile inconsistent findings on the relationship between CSR and business performance.

1 For the purpose of this study, East Asia includes China (PRC), North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong (PRC), Macau (PRC), and Taiwan.

performance. Second, strategy is always bound by the contingent context, so we investi-

gate the different levels of moderators and the evolution of CSR in East Asia. The findings

have thus extended our understanding on the boundary conditions of the relationship

between CSR and business performance in East Asia. Third, to answer questions about

CSR measurement modes, we explore measure as a moderator. Thus we aim to uncover

cumulative evidence of East Asian CSR as it relates to business performance.

The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we review

the concepts and invoke the signaling theory and institutional theory to propose the

research framework, including various moderators. Next we provide detailed method-

ology of meta-analysis and research findings. Finally, we discuss limitations, future

research directions, and conclusions.

# Theory and hypotheses

# The concept and theory of CSR in East Asia

# CSR in East Asia

CSR is generally viewed as “context-specific organizational actions and policies that take

into account stakeholders’ expectations and the triple bottom line of economic, social, and

environmental performance” (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012: 137). Western researchers began to

use the term commonly in the late 1960s and early 1970s after many multinational

corporations formed the concept of stakeholders; that is, internal, external, and environ-

mental constituents who can influence or are influenced by firms’ activities (Freeman,

1984). CSR henceforth became a hotspot in business ethics research (Luo & Bhattacharya,

2006). Most global academic CSR studies focus on America and Europe (Wood, 2010).

However, CSR is receiving growing attention in Asian contexts where characteristics might

diverge from American or European contexts (Baughn et al., 2007). In this study, we focus

CSR in East Asia, which has been used to refer to a wide geographical area covering

People’s Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. East Asia has received

particular interests in the respect of CSR as it is characterized by a unique understanding

and practice of CSR (Scholtens & Kang, 2012). For example, a cross-country comparison

showed that philanthropy, a type of CSR, is most prevalent in North America, significantly

lower in Europe, and even lower in Asia; Asians tend to focus on CSR’s economic

rationale, but ignore issues such as human rights for employees; Asian firms ask employees

to work longer hours (Welford, 2005). Business students in the United States and Hong

Kong surveyed about CSR showed that Westerners are more likely to cite noneconomic,

ethical, and legal rationales for CSR, while Easterners prefer economic rationales

(Burton, Farh, & Hegarty, 2000). Similarly, the China-developed CSC9000T (China Social

Compliance 9000 for Textile and Apparel industry) differs sharply from normal CSR

activities in Western countries. Moreover, Asians may view CSR value uniquely because

they are influenced by both Western ideas and Eastern values. It is worth noting that though

lots of CEOs in East Asian firms do not understand the content and meaning of CSR,

environmental protection and charitable activity are widely known and adopted in this

region. In practice, the concept of CSR is not really a fresh one in East Asia, and CSR

practices may be known by philanthropy and other names (Baughn et al., 2007).

# Signaling theory and institutional theory

Diverse theories, such as agency theory, stakeholder theory, stewardship theory, institutional theory, and classical economic theory, have been used to explain the CSR–performance link, and each theory offers insights for explaining the linkage. For instance, agency theory suggests that some managers adopt CSR to advance their careers or for self-aggrandizement, using firm resources that would be better returned to firm shareholders or spent on urgent projects (Friedman, 1970). Stewardship theory, by contrast, implies that firm managers are morally compelled to conduct CSR activities without considering the actual value to business performance (Donaldson & Davis, 1991). In this study, we emphasize that signaling theory and the institutional theory can jointly contribute to the CSR literature.

# Signaling theory

Signaling theory took root in the idea of asymmetries information between two parties where the causes of asymmetric information (a deviation from perfect information) are primarily derived from quality information or intent information (Connelly, Certo, Ireland, & Reutzel, 2011). One party credibly conveys information of quality and shows the unobservable attributes of itself to another party with the purpose of gaining a premium (Spence, 1973). While intent information can help parties reduce the possible moral hazards that result from the behavior of the individuals or organizations during the transaction (Su, Peng, Tan, & Chueng, 2014). Spence’s (1973) job market signaling model illustrates that the potential employees can send an observable signal (e.g., college diploma and qualification certificate) to firms to show their unobservable characteristics (working ability). Based on these perceptions, CSR scholars have adopted signaling theory to examine the potential value of CSR practices in management research (Montiel, Husted, & Christmann, 2012; Ramchander, Schwebach, & Staking, 2012; Su et al., 2014; Turban & Greening, 1996). For instance, Su et al. (2014) argued that the process of signal transmission can avoid asymmetric information between firms and investors. Therefore, firms adopting CSR practices can send unobservable characteristics (attitude towards social and environmental issues) to investors in capital markets. King, Lenox, and Terlaak (2005) argued that Environmental Management Standard ISO 14000 transfer a green signal conveying organization’s attitude towards environment and other unobservable information to the outside individuals and organizations. Particularly, the phenomenon of information asymmetries will decrease when organizations sending green signals or other private management certification (King et al., 2005). As an unobservable attribute of organization, CSR practices can play the roles of green and good signals that provide important information to stakeholders, especially in the Asian context (Su et al., 2014). Although CSR practices may cause financial costs and other implicit costs (e.g., management costs), the costs will ultimately pay off when organizations have “stakeholder influence capacity” (Barnett, 2007). The ability is difficult for low-capability competitors to imitate because this ability is built over time through heavily investments (Barnett & Salomon, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). CSR practices can help firms improve the relationships with stakeholders and obtain this capacity.

# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?

# Institutional theory

CSR has become a popular topic in the management literature, but has neglected the importance of institutional environments to a great extent (Brammer, Jackson, & Matten, 2012). Institutional theory mainly focuses on the external system environment, such as social, political, and economic systems, that surround organizations and grant them legitimacy status (North, 1990). Firm’s reactions to external institutional pressures may range from active conformity to passive resistance, depending on the specific circumstance and nature of the pressures (Oliver, 1991). In the mid-2000s, several studies used institutional theory as a core conceptual lens to explain CSR-related problems (Aguilera, Rupp, Williams, & Ganapathi, 2007; Campbell, 2011; Matten & Moon, 2008). Institutional theory allows scholars to get a better understanding of CSR in two ways: the heterogeneity of CSR and the dynamics of CSR. On the issue of heterogeneity, several scholars attempted to explore the cross-national differences of CSR from the lens of institutional theory (Blasco & Zolner, 2010; Gjolberg, 2009; Jackson, 2010). They found the value of CSR practices in different countries and regions is contingent on the different institutional environments (Deakin & Whittaker, 2007; Doh & Guay, 2006). Institutional environments here not only includes the formal institutions (e.g., laws, rules, and regulations), but also the informal institutions (e.g., religion, guanxi, and custom). On another issue of dynamics, business ethics scholars attempt to explore the changes of concepts, values, and mechanism of CSR (Brammer et al., 2012). For instance, the core content of CSR has changed through adaptation and emulation by organizations outside the Western institutional system. Institutional theory plays an important role for explaining the dynamics of CSR. In this study, we employ signaling theory and institutional theory combined as our overarching theoretical viewpoints to explain the CSR–performance link and related contingent influences.

# CSR and business performance in East Asia

“After more than thirty years of research, we cannot clearly conclude whether a one dollar investment in social initiatives returns more or less than one dollar in benefit to the shareholder” (Barnett, 2007: 794).

One question in the lasting debate about business ethics is whether it is worthwhile for firms to engage in CSR practice, especially from the financial perspective. Business scholars generally find a positive relationship between CSR and firm performance, while economic scholars sometimes find a negative or non-significant effect (Su et al., 2014). According to signaling theory, CSR practices can send positive signal to customers, suppliers, government, and other stakeholders. This CSR signal contains several unobservable characteristics (e.g., attitude towards the society) that make firms capable of reducing risks, filling institutional deficiency, and improving stakeholders’ relationships (Miller, Lee, Chang, & Le Breton-Miller, 2009; Porter & Kramer, 2006; Rivoli & Waddock, 2011). After receiving the signal, relevant stakeholders may provide premiums to organizations if these stakeholders value the above unobservable characteristics (Ramchander et al., 2012; Spence, 1973). The CSR signal can gain support to meet stakeholder demands, prevent costly conflicts, improve stakeholder relationships, and enhance business performance. In other words, better CSR could be the difference that would improve employee satisfaction, corporate reputation, and

M. Hou et al.

customer loyalty, all ultimately beneficial to firm outcomes (Hart & Ahuja, 1996). In addition, environmental pollution is becoming a critical problem in East Asia, so governments have established related policies to encourage environmentally friendly activities. Thus firms engaging in environmental CSR to reduce pollution, recycle, and reduce energy consumption can receive grants and incentives (Branco & Rodrigues, 2006; Hull & Rothenberg, 2008). Besides, investors and financial analysts also attach great importance to organization’s CSR practices (Doh, Howton, Howton, & Siegel, 2010; Luo, Wang, Raithel, & Zheng, 2015).

Previous empirical studies have obtained promising evidence that types of CSR signals are beneficial in East Asia. For example, citizenship and employee commitment were found to be positively related in China (Chun, 2009). Philanthropic disaster relief was found to positively impact firm profitability in China (Gao, 2011). CSR (both equal-weighted and stakeholder-weighted CSR indexes) was found to be positively related with business performance in Korea (Choi et al., 2010). CSR scores were found to be positively related with ROA indicators in Asian samples (Scholtens & Kang, 2012). Those studies prompt us to argue for a positive relationship between CSR and business performance in the East Asian context. Therefore, we propose the following:

# Hypothesis 1

In East Asia, corporate social responsibility is positively related to business performance.

# Environmental CSR vs. social CSR

In the current CSR–performance literature, CSR has been identified as environmental performance, corporate philanthropy, and ethical behavior, all referring to different scopes and contents of CSR practice. We investigate how the categories of CSR affect the CSR–performance relationship. According to the types of CSR signals, we divide CSR practice into two categories: environmental and social CSR (Baughn et al., 2007). Environmental CSR captures natural environmental protection and green production. Social CSR is related to social and community issues such as ethical behavior and corporate philanthropy (Marín, Rubio, & Maya, 2012). Environmental CSR can transfer “green signals” to stakeholders, while social CSR mainly send “good signals.” Both CSR types can send signals and satisfy stakeholders’ demands and yield competitive advantage. However, environmental CSR and social CSR have different influences in the aspect of signaling.

Although in the past, the natural environment took a back seat to boosting the economic development in East Asia, the public and government value more about environmental issues (Baughn et al., 2007). We argue that the natural environment is closely tied to human health; everyone has a stake in environmental CSR practices. Under great pressure from the public, communities, and the media, the Chinese government has pledged $275 billion over the next five years to clean the air. Since January 2014, 15,000 factories, including large state-owned enterprises, have been required to publicly report real-time figures on their air emissions and water discharges. The government promises to improve environmental quality, and asks firms to enhance their environmental CSR practices to assist in the cleanup. These environmental CSR activities help firms build close relationship with governments, obtain political legitimacy, and get access to key regulatory resources (Sheng, Zhou, & Li, 2011), which in turn may bring beneficial privileges. Other studies also demonstrated a more important role of environmental CSR in East Asian regions. In Tanimoto and Suzuki’s (2005)

# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?

In their research, they found that Japanese firms prefer to disclose CSR information about environmental conservation policies and relative activities rather than social issues. Welford’s (2005) research found that 50% of Korean enterprises and 62% of Japanese enterprises had detailed policies on environmental protection reporting. In South Korea, there was a greater emphasis on green production processes (environmental CSR) and less emphasis on employee relations (social CSR) (Chapple & Moon, 2005). Drawing from over 8700 surveys of firms in 104 countries, Baughn et al. (2007) found that both Japanese and Taiwanese regions demonstrate substantially higher commitment to environmental than social CSR. They also found the level of environmental CSR was higher than social CSR in South Korea (Baughn et al., 2007). Welford (2005) also conducted surveys to compare CSR in different regions and found social CSR (philanthropy) was most prevalent in North America, significantly lower in Europe and even lower in Asia. We argue that East Asian firm’s stakeholders are expressing more concern about firm’s natural environmental signals. That is, the “green signals” are more attractive than “good signals” to stakeholders in East Asian contexts. In contrast, Western countries are focused more on social CSR, which emphasizes social and community issues, ethical behavior, and corporate philanthropy. Thus, we expect:

# Hypothesis 2

In East Asia, environmental CSR has a stronger positive effect on business performance than social CSR.

# Operational performance vs. financial performance

Most practicing managers and branches of organization and management research are interested in business performance as a recurrent theme (Richarc, Devinney, Yip, & Johnson, 2009). In the CSR research area, CSR and business performance have mixed relationships partly because of diverse performance measures (Lev, Petrovits, & Ranhakrishnan, 2010; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2006). CSR studies have adopted various business performance measures for ascertaining CSR benefits, including return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), market share, and employee commitment. To better understand our focal linkage, we must recognize and classify the core content of business performance.

Among previous classifications of business performance indicators adopted in CSR studies, financial and operational performance are most commonly used (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012). In this meta-analytic review, in accordance with Venkatraman and Ramanujam (1986), we measure both financial performance and operational performance because both indicate firms’ wealth (Luo, Huang, & Wang, 2012). Financial performance is indicated by financial and market indicators reflecting achievements of the firm’s economic targets. Operational performance is indicated by outcomes related to the firm’s social relationships and competitive advantages leading to operational efficiency (Luo et al., 2012). Table 1 provides details of business performance measures included in this meta-analysis.

Specifically we argue that CSR would have a stronger positive association for operational performance than for financial performance, mainly because of the cost factor related to CSR activities. That is, in order to satisfy different stakeholders, CSR activities incur some cost and may consume the profit, especially in the initial stage of CSR (Lev et al., 2010). Firms must devote considerable resources to CSR activities that then affect the firm’s net outcome. In comparison, CSR directly and positively

influences operational indicators (Surroca, Tribo, & Waddock, 2010), such as corporate culture (Marcoulides & Heck, 1993), organizational reputation (Roberts & Dowling, 2002), and innovative technology (Cho & Pucik, 2005). A recent study showed that in Japan environmental CSR directly influenced technological innovation (Cole et al., 2006). Similarly, corporate citizenship has been shown to enhance employee commitment (Chun, 2009). Thus CSR strongly and directly drives operational performance. After cost-related issues are calculated, financial performance profits would be indirect outcomes. Consequently, we argue that CSR is positively related to operational performance and has varied effects on financial performance. More precisely, we hypothesize:

# Hypothesis 3

In East Asia, corporate social responsibility has a stronger positive effect on operational performance than on financial performance.

# CSR–performance contingencies

We have argued that CSR practice has a focal relationship with business performance in East Asian firms. Because the nature, connotation, and value of CSR practices may vary in different regions, industries and firms, we now address the contextual factors that may determine CSR profitability. Answering the call to compare CSR roles in various contexts (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012), we incorporated several contextual variables at the macro-level (economic development), meso-level (industry setting), and micro-level (firm size and organizational form) to examine the contingencies in the CSR–business performance relationship.

We had several reasons for choosing the contextual factors we examine. First, at the macro-level, institutional context plays important roles in determining appropriate CSR initiatives (Arya & Zhang, 2009). For example, domestic Kenyan organizations’ CSR approach is different from foreign organizations due to the different institutional environments of global and domestic markets (Muthuri & Gilbert, 2011). Therefore, we consider the contingent roles of economic development (developed vs. developing) to set conditions on the value of CSR practice. Second, at the meso-level, industry setting is important because not all CSR activities are equally beneficial to all industries (Scott, 1995). For instance, manufacturing industries have a stronger negative effect on the environment, so they may attract more attention from stakeholders than firms from service industries (Reverte, 2009). Firms that sell products to customers directly are more likely to engage in corporate philanthropy as a strategy, while firms targeting customers consider the ethics of CSR (Tang & Li, 2009). In a sample of US companies, firms in heavy industries (e.g., mining, raw materials, and chemicals) were more likely to focus on the natural environment and employee conditions, while firms in light industries (e.g., retail) tended to focus on corporate philanthropy (O’Connor & Shumate, 2010). As a result, manufacturing and service industries have heterogeneous values regarding CSR. Third, at the micro-level, we consider firm size because it can influence CSR actions (Lepoutre & Heene, 2006) and moderate the relationship between CSR and competitiveness (Marín et al., 2012). For example, SMEs and non-SMEs may differ in CSR visibility and decision making preferences (Brammer & Millington, 2005). Recent studies also found that firm size can influence CSR.

M. Hou et al.

actions (Lepoutre & Heene, 2006) and moderate the relationship between CSR and competitiveness (Marín et al., 2012). Fourth, organizational form may influence the CSR–performance relationship. Specifically, public firms, whose shares are traded on a stock exchange, often receive higher levels of media and public attention forcing them to engage in CSR activities. In contrast, private firms receiving less press and public attention are more flexible and may derive different benefits from CSR.

# Economic development: Developed and developing countries

East Asian countries are at various economic development stages. Their cultural backgrounds, institutional settings, and CSR activities vary because of distinct institutional environments and different coercive or cognitive pressures to engage in CSR (Baughn et al., 2007; Maignan & Ralston, 2002). We follow Reed’s (2002) classification and divide Asian national economic development into developing and developed categories. Developed East Asian economies, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, are characterized by stable demand, intense competition, short channels, and sophisticated buyers (Ellis, 2006). Their various stakeholders, such as the state, professions, publics, and interest groups, exert pressures and expect CSR (Baughn et al., 2007). While, developing regions, such as People’s Republic of China, are characterized by weak legal system, poor law enforcement, pervasive corruption, and other institution deficiency phenomenon (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, & Vishny, 1998).

As outlined above, CSR practices can transfer green and good signals to customers, suppliers, government, and other relevant stakeholders for the estimation of organization’s attitude towards environmental and social issues. If a firm is known to have better CSR than their competitors, key stakeholders will perceive the CSR activity as a signal of good reputation (Su & He, 2010) differentiating the firm from competitors. We argue that the strength of these signals may vary in different East Asian regions with different institutional backgrounds (King et al., 2005; Montiel et al., 2012). That is, in developing regions, CSR practices signals play a more important role in improving business performance.

In Japan, South Korea, and other East Asian developed regions, it is much easier for stakeholders to get relevant CSR information about the firm (e.g., CSR disclosure report, corporate philanthropy). Those firms with poor corporate social performance will always be punished by government, customers, and industry associations (Godfrey, Merrill, & Hansen, 2009). Stakeholders in advanced economies also have the capacity to access large amounts of non-CSR information to judge firm’s CSR practices (Andrade & Chhaochharia, 2010). Furthermore, media exposure, disclosure reports, and other forms of information transformation facilitate the investment decisions more quickly by investors. In general, according to the information, stakeholders can evaluate firm’s CSR practices more conveniently and accurately. Therefore, the signaling role of CSR practices as a tool for solving information asymmetry becomes diluted in a situational environment with large amounts of information. Conversely, developing East Asian economies, such as China, are pursuing rapid economic development but have weak social institutions and high uncertainty (Reed, 2002) and often lag behind in many CSR aspects (Welford, 2004). Because firms in China and other East Asian emerging economics are not used to disclosing CSR related information, stakeholders are difficult to access the valuable information concerning firms’ CSR attitude. Thus, the signaling role of CSR in these regions is more valuable for stakeholders in assessing.

# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?

The organization’s potential value (Montiel et al., 2012). In addition, in emerging economies, the institutional environment often changes dramatically when local governments introduce various new laws and regulations (Chung & Beamish, 2005; Dileleman & Sachs, 2008). By building strong connections with governmental stakeholders, firms in transitional environments can use CSR to compensate for their shortcomings.

Generally, in East Asian developing regions where CSR is less predominant, the signaling role of CSR practices may turn into a powerful instrument for improving firms’ business performance. By comparison, stakeholders do not have to depend on signals sent from CSR to evaluate the organization, because there is a lot of information from different signals other than CSR in developed regions. Thus we posit:

# Hypothesis 4

In East Asia, the impact of CSR on business performance is stronger in developing regions than in developed regions.

# Industry setting: Manufacturing and service

Because diverse stakeholders will subject firms in different sectors to different pressures, industry effect is a crucial contextual factor in the relationship between CSR and business performance (Beurden & Gossling, 2008; Brammer & Pavelin, 2006; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Pressures arise because economic activities and social externalities are closely associated (Berman, Wicks, Kotha, & Jones, 1999; Rowley & Berman, 2000). Satisfying constituencies’ demands for improved social responsiveness is also in the interests of companies because they depend on their stakeholders for the resources they need for continuing survival and success (Hillman & Keim, 2001; Mitchell, Agle, & Wood, 1997).

We classified industry settings as either manufacturing or service industries. Service industries, such as education, banking, insurance, transportation, and retail, supply services to organizations and consumers. Manufacturing industries are involved “in the manufacturing and processing of items and indulge in either creation of new commodities or in value addition of materials” (Emmanuel and Oladiran, 2015: 137) and generate more pollution during production processes. Therefore, manufacturing firms are directly and closely related to environmental issues. That is, the CSR signals which are transferred by manufacturing firms tend to be green signals (Williamson, Lynch-Wood, & Ramsay, 2006). As we discussed above, stakeholders in East Asian regions attach more importance to environmental issues. So CSR signals sent by manufacturing firms can satisfy East Asian stakeholders more accurately and appropriately.

In contrast, service firms, being more environmentally friendly and less polluting, can send signals related more to social issues. While it is difficult for these social signals to attract stakeholders’ attention in East Asian regions. Consequently, service companies must be more socially and environmentally responsive to counter the externality problems they create, but generally find it more difficult to meet stakeholders’ requirements through formal legitimate CSR strategies (Williamson et al., 2006). Thus, we propose:

# Hypothesis 5

In East Asia, the impact of CSR on business performance is stronger in manufacturing firms than in service firms.

# Firm size: SMEs vs. non-SMEs

Firm size shapes organizational behaviors and decisions, including CSR actions (Allouche & Laroche, 2005). Following Fang, Randolph, Memili, and Chrisman’s (2015) definition of SMEs, we classify firms as SMEs (small and medium enterprises with less than 500 employees) and non-SMEs (businesses with more than 500 employees). The diversity between sizes raises questions as to whether SMEs and non-SMEs benefit equally from CSR strategies (Godfrey et al., 2009; Sharma, 2000). We argue that SMEs will enjoy higher CSR value than will non-SMEs in East Asia.

First, CSR signal is a better tool for SMEs to resolve information asymmetry. Most large companies now disclose information covering dimensions of CSR such as social and environmental performance, health and safety issues, and ethics. Large companies usually disclose more information than small companies (Jenkins & Yakovleva, 2006). In contrast, several East Asian SMEs, even without a website, do not have an appropriate way to deliver information to relevant stakeholders. The CSR signal is more valuable for SMEs because relevant stakeholders have limited information about SMEs and are difficult to evaluate firms’ CSR attitude. Second, SMEs suffer the liability of smallness; they need more external resources and legitimacy support than non-SMEs, and therefore they may gain significant advantages from CSR as long as their stakeholders perceive their CSR activities positively (Mackey, Mackey, & Barney, 2007; Siegel & Vitaliano, 2007). Third, SMEs can organize their CSR activities more flexibly because their internal decision-making processes are simpler and quicker (Hannan & Freeman, 1989). In contrast, non-SMEs may be less inclined to CSR activities because they have less need for external legitimacy, and their decision-making related to CSR strategy may be quite complex and relatively slow. Moreover, their large scale may cloud the relationship between CSR and business performance (Luo, 2006). As such, we posit:

# Hypothesis 6

In East Asia, the impact of CSR on business performance is stronger in SMEs than in non-SMEs.

# Organizational form: Private and public

Organizational form is another contingency that might impact the value of CSR to business performance (e.g., Dixon-Fowler et al., 2012). We classify organizations as either private or public.

Under the supervision of the public, public companies always disclose large amounts of information with respect to environmental and social issues in order to justify their existence, document their performance, and satisfy shareholders (Jenkins & Yakovleva, 2006). For instance, public firms that receive greater media coverage are used to disclose more CSR information (Frost, 2000). Information asymmetry is relatively mild between stakeholders and public firms because relevant stakeholders can access information to evaluate firms through public disclose report and other non-CSR information. Therefore, the signaling role of CSR practices becomes diluted for public firms. Besides, public firms that offer securities to the general public through a

# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?

Stock exchange are under stakeholder scrutiny (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001), so that they must undertake CSR to compete in the current competitive environment. However, “if an entire sector is collaborating on CSR, the reward of competitive advantage for each company involved is diluted” (Draper, 2006: 410). Therefore, public firms may find it difficult to differentiate themselves from their competitors through normal CSR practices.

In contrast, the phenomenon of information asymmetry is more serious to privates. Although more private companies began to realize the value of CSR practices in East Asia, only a few private companies provide relatively little detailed CSR information in the annual reports, and it is often qualitative and not quantitative (Jenkins & Yakovleva, 2006). Frost’s (2000) study found several private firms even are not disclosing any information on their CSR impacts. In this case, stakeholders hardly evaluate private firm’s CSR attitude because of lacking adequate information. The signaling role of CSR practices is more valuable for private firms than public firms. In addition, private firms, run by private individuals or groups, receive less press and public attention, so they are more likely to have relatively flexible CSR practices. If outside stakeholders are aware that private firms actively participate in CSR, their activities can be good differentiators for leveraging and acquiring more intangible resources, including organizational reputation and highly skilled human resources. Hence, we propose:

# Hypothesis 7

In East Asia, the impact of CSR on business performance is stronger in private firms than in public firms.

# Exploratory methodological moderators and CSR’s evolution

# Measurement issue

Meta-analytic reviews have the advantage of dealing with measures, methods, and moderators from prior research (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990). Previous studies on the CSR–performance relationship have confounded CSR measurement through a variety of data sources and measures (Allouche & Laroche, 2005; Griffin & Mahon, 1997). We devote extra attention to investigating CSR measurement as a potential cause of mixed findings regarding the CSR–business performance link.

Consistent with Dixon-Fowler et al. (2012), we consider two CSR measures: archival (indirect) and self-report (direct) data. Archival data come from third parties such as Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (Cheung et al., 2010), Asian Sustainability Rating (Scholtens & Kang, 2012), Shanghai National Accounting Institute (Li, & Zhang, 2010), and Korea Economic Justice Institute (Choi et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2011). Self-report data come from surveys of managers through questionnaires. The different CSR measures are controversial: self-report data have potential inherent bias because they cannot measure CSR objectively (Schwarz, 1999), while archival data fail to depict the versatility of CSR activities. Therefore, we review the Asian CSR literature methodically to examine whether using archival data generates distinctive outcomes compared with self-report measures. Addressing this methodological moderator with the help of meta-analysis will reveal whether different types of measures cause the business performance variances previously reported.

# CSR evolution

In addition, meta-analytic technology will help solve the debate surrounding whether CSR may decrease, stabilize, or increase in East Asian contexts. In recent years, CEOs have been attracted to CSR rationalizations and the possible positive links between CSR and business performance (Vogel, 2005). Two decades ago, most managers perceived CSR practice as irrelevant for performance improvement (Klepper & Mackler, 1986), but the US Chamber of Commerce and Corporate Citizenship Center reported that 82 % of firms now believe that CSR adds value to practice (Lee, 2008), indicating that perceptions about CSR have changed considerably in the United States. Due to the difficulty of collecting longitudinal data, current literature scarcely explore the evolution of CSR. From the perspective of institutional theory, East Asian transition economy, such as China, has the characteristics of weak institutional framework, underdeveloped legal system, and incomplete market information (Luo, 2003). At the initial stage of transitional development, CSR practices can play an important role in sending green and good signals to stakeholders and cover the shortage of information asymmetry. However, as the acceleration of institutional transition increases, an increasing number of organizations realize the importance of CSR information disclosure. The phenomenon of information asymmetry will be alleviated and the value of CSR signals will be decreased. To determine whether East Asian businesses similarly value CSR all the time, we used our meta-analytical tools to explore CSR’s evolutionary path in the East Asian context. Figure 1 summarizes the overall conceptual model of our meta-analysis.

# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?

In empirical studies, we used the following combinatory “snowballing” search techniques (Heugens, Van Essen, & Van Oosterhout, 2009), through which we collected published and unpublished papers. First, we systematically scanned several popular electronic databases: (1) ABI/INFORM Complete, (2) EBSCOhost, (3) Emerald, (4) Google Scholar, (5) ISI Web of Knowledge, (6) JSTOR, (7) SpringerLink, and (8) Wiley InterScience, using search keywords: corporate social responsibility, CSR, corporate social performance, corporate social responsiveness, corporate citizenship, corporate conscience, sustainable responsible business, East Asia, and performance. Second, to supplement the electronic search, we manually searched the most relevant management and business ethics journals, including Journal of Business Ethics (JBE), Academy of Management Journal (AMJ), Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS), Journal of Operations Management (JOM), Strategic Management Journal (SMJ), Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Management (CSREM), Business and Society (BS), and other mainstream journals considered most highly cited in business research related to CSR topics (Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1992). Third, we consulted several review articles (e.g., Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Beurden & Gossling, 2008; Wood, 2010) and one meta-analysis (Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003) focusing on CSR, checked the reference lists from all pertinent literature, and traced all sources citing them using the ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar to identify any studies we might have overlooked. Finally, to gather unpublished articles and obtain meta-analysis information as completely as possible, we emailed 22 authors of relevant papers and asked for electronic drafts, correlation matrixes, and detailed information about the samples. After emailing corresponding authors, we received 12 responses in total. One author replied with the information about industry, three authors provided the information about firm size, and four authors introduced the organizational form.

Our main purpose is to examine the relationship between CSR and business performance in East Asia, so we used the following inclusion criteria. First, articles should focus on the East Asian context, should draw their data from East Asia, and should use empirical methods to investigate the relationship between CSR and business performance. We excluded essays, case studies, simulation studies, or narrative reviews. Second, the literature had to offer correlation coefficient tables and sample sizes to support our meta-analysis. If not, studies should report measurement procedures and correlations’ convertible equivalents so that we could calculate the correlation coefficient with the transformation formula (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990). Third, we excluded studies if they measured business performance of nonprofit organizations. Prior to the meta-analysis, we coded effect size, sample size, and moderator variables (economic development, industry setting, firm size, organizational form, and measures) in all selected studies. We sorted business performance into financial performance or operational performance (see Table 1). To reduce coding error, we invited two doctoral students who are familiar with CSR literature to read all papers in the final set and code every study individually with the help of a coding protocol (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Coding differences are often caused by ambiguities in the coding scheme. Therefore, all different viewpoints about coding were discussed and determined before the meta-analysis began. We concentrate on developing clear and detailed coding rules when piloting our scheme. The process of coding evaluation can report the reliability on the coding of moderators and provide a check on the coding and effect size.

calculations. To evaluate the coding process, we used Cohen’s kappa for two raters. The equation for k is: k ¼ Pr a−Pr e. The inter-rater coefficient in this study is higher than 90 %, which means the reliability of our coding process is admissible. After the coding process, we found Zhang, Rezaee, and Zhu (2009) and Zhang, Zhu, Yue, and Zhu (2010) shared the same samples in their empirical studies. Therefore, we excluded Zhang et al.’s (2009) study from our database.

Based on our multipronged screening process, the ultimate data of our meta-analysis contains 31,773 firm samples from 28 primary studies published from 2001 to 2015, yielding a total of 89 effect sizes. As Chapple and Moon (2005) stated, a great deal of research has been conducted on CSR in Western countries but relatively little focuses on Asia. Christmann and Taylor’s (2001) research was the earliest study that we found. In addition, sample sizes ranged from 86 (Wang et al., 2011) to 10,346 (Sheng, 2013) with an average sample size of 1,134. Ten appeared in JBE, three in AMJ, two in JIBS, one in JOM, and the rest from other journals. Appendix A lists the full details of studies included in our meta-analysis. All articles included in our meta-analysis are also identified in References with an asterisk indicator.

# Measures

CSR and its sister concept—corporate social performance—have been measured in surveys or social reports (i.e., company self-reports and objective data) (Luo, 2006; Scholtens & Kang, 2012; Zhang et al., 2009; Zhu & Sarkis, 2004), KLD ratings (Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co.; Wang et al., 2011), and other methods (Wood, 2010). Following Baughn et al. (2007), we classified CSR as social and environmental CSR. Social CSR is closely related to corporate philanthropy, humanization, and other social practices; environmental CSR focuses on green management, environmental protection, and energy conservation (Orlitzky et al., 2003). We could not classify CSR definitions in studies that adopted multiple CSR definitions, so we excluded them from our subgroup analyses (n = 16). In general, CSR measurement in this research is theoretically driven and consistent with previous studies. We also classified business performance as financial (financial indicators and market indicators) and operational (competitive indicators and social indicators). Table 1 shows details.

Drawing on Ellis (2005), we classified economic development as developed or developing. The most common criteria for evaluating development is to look at gross domestic product (GDP), per capita income, level of industrialization, the amount of widespread infrastructure, and general standard of living. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reports the “World Economic Outlook” and provides the classification of advanced economies and developing economies each year. According to the classification of IMF, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are generally regarded as developed Asian economies. In contrast, most parts of Asia, such as People’s Republic of China are regarded as developing economies. After checking statistical data from 2001 to 2014, we found the classification of IMF is stable and unchanged.

Pr (a) is the relative observed agreement among raters; Pr (e) is the hypothetical probability of chance agreement, using the observed data to calculate the probabilities of each observer randomly saying each category.

The number (31,773) refers to the total number of firms across the 28 studies.

# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?

It is noteworthy that given the time span, there are no countries that make the transition from “developing” to “developed.” Following Beurden and Gossling (2008), we classified industries as manufacturing and service industries. Studies with samples from multiple industry settings (n = 19) were excluded from the comparison between manufacturing and service industries. Following Fang et al.’s (2015) definition of SMEs, we coded firm size based on the number of employees in each sample: small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with fewer than 500 employees and large-scale enterprises (non-SMEs) with more than 500 employees. We contacted 22 authors of relevant papers to ask for firm size if the article failed to provide the information. We excluded studies that included samples from mixed or unknown firm size (n = 21) during the comparison. Drawing on previous studies, we classified organizational form as either private firms or public firms (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2012). Private firms are run by private individuals or groups, usually for profit, and are not controlled by the state. By contrast, public firms are limited liability firms that offer securities (stock/shares, bonds/loans, etc.) to the general public, typically through a stock exchange. They often receive more stakeholder attention (Caves & Christensen, 1980). We excluded studies that included samples from mixed or unknown organizational forms during the comparison (n = 11).

# Meta-analysis procedure

We used CMA 2.0 and applied Hendges and Olkin’s (1985) meta-analysis procedures, including calculating weighted mean correlations and 95 % confidence intervals (Hendges & Olkin, 1985; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001), to analyze the initial data and test proposed hypotheses. Zero-order correlations between CSR and business performance were calculated from each article and then corrected for the measurement error. We adopted Pearson product-moment correlation (r) in our meta-analysis because it is a widely used effect size statistic with scale free in management studies (Hunter & Schmidt, 1990). Several studies were found to report correlations linking CSR with various performance components (e.g., both return on assets and return on equity for financial performance). Following Ellis’s (2006) method, we averaged the correlations across them within each study to arrive at a mean performance score. Following Hedge and Olkin, we applied Fisher’s Zr-transformation procedures to correct the distribution of effect sizes because of the assumption that effect sizes are normally distributed (Hendges & Olkin, 1985; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Correlations based on large research offer greater precision than in small studies because of smaller sampling errors (Hendges & Olkin, 1985; Hunter & Schmidt, 1990), so we weighted each effect size by adopting its inverse variance weight to obtain the accurate mean effects. Then we used the weights to calculate the standard error of the mean effect and the upper and lower bounds of 95 % confidence interval (Whitener, 1990). We also calculated the Q-statistic to test the homogeneous distribution of effect sizes and estimate the likelihood of moderators that explain the variability in correlations over studies (Hendges & Olkin, 1985; Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).

We divided extant studies into mutually exclusive groups and applied subgroup meta-analysis in each CSR domain (environmental CSR and social CSR) and business performance category (financial performance and operational performance), to compare.

# Results

# Main Effects: CSR and business performance

With the help of meta-analytic techniques described above, we integrated the relationship between CSR and business performance as well as the moderating effects of contingency factors and reported the number of organizations (n), number of effect size (k), weight mean r, stand error, the corresponding 95 % confidence interval, and Q-statistic (see Table 2).

In our meta-analysis, Rosenberg’s (2005) fail-safe N is 3,320. This means that we need to locate and include 3,320 “null” studies for the combined 2-tailed p-value to exceed .05. Put another way, we would need 38 missing studies for every observed study for the effect to be nullified. Accordingly, the quality of our meta-analysis results can be assured.

The detailed process of meta-analysis

We first estimated the average effect sizes between overall CSR and business performance and obtained a positive significant result (r = .158, k = 87, 95 % CI = .150–.165). The correlation is significant because the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals do not include zero. The significant heterogeneity Q-value (2,411.421) suggests the existence of moderators. This finding encourages us to conduct further research for potential moderators. Table 2 shows subgroup meta-analysis results suggesting a weak positive relationship between CSR and financial performance (r = .098, k = 52, 95 % CI = .089–.106). We also found CSR has a significant positive association with operational performance (r = .426, k = 28, 95 % CI = .409–.441). Besides, we found the relationship between environmental CSR (r = .434, k = 16, 95 % CI = .397–.469) and business performance is stronger than the social CSR–business link (r = .039, k = 9, 95 % CI = .024–.055). Based on those results, we conclude that CSR and various indicators of business performance have positive relationships. Therefore, Hypotheses 1 and 2 are supported. The meta-analysis results also indicate that the average effect of CSR on operational performance (r = .426, k = 28, 95 % CI = .409–.441) is much greater than on financial performance (r = .098, k = 52, 95 % CI = .089–.106). This result confirms Hypothesis 3, indicating that CSR brings distinctly different benefits in terms of nature and type.

# Moderating effects

Regarding the moderating role of economic development, meta-regression results show that CSR has a larger effect size for developing economies than developed economies (β = −.120, p = .028) in East Asia. Table 3 provides the detailed findings for the moderating variable of economic development. Hypothesis 4 is supported. This research finding conforms to our reasoning that economic development is an important moderator in the CSR–business link.

In terms of industry setting as a moderator, no differences were found significant for the CSR-business performance linkage (β = .034, n.s.). The non-significant result confirms that in Asia the industry setting is not a significant contingent factor for the linkage between CSR and business performance. Therefore, we could not conclude that CSR has a larger effect for manufacturing firms than for service firms in East Asia. Hypothesis 5 is not supported.

Firm-specific characteristics are additional potential moderating factors affecting the CSR–business performance relationship. We explored the linkage by examining the difference between subgroups of SMEs versus non-SMEs and private versus public firms. Supporting Hypothesis 6, we found that firm size moderates the CSR–business performance relationship (β = −.184, p = .000). Meta-regression results show that CSR has a stronger impact on business performance for SMEs than for non-SMEs. The result supports Hypothesis 6, in opposition to Allouche and Laroche (2005) who found that firm size does not influence the impact of CSR. Future studies can explore this issue further.

Testing Hypothesis 7, we found that organizational form has a significant moderating effect (β = .149, p = .003) and that CSR has a stronger impact on business performance for private firms than for public firms. This result supports Hypothesis 7.

As discussed previously, CSR–business performance studies have used a variety of CSR measures. Concerning the exploratory methodological moderators, Table 3 presents the relationships between the two most commonly used CSR measures and business performance, indicating that they were different in empirical studies (β =

The above moderators were treated as independent variables (economic development: developed = 1; developing = 0, industry setting: manufacturing = 1; service = 0, firm size: Non-SMEs = 1; SMEs = 0, organizational form: private = 1; public = 0, measurement: archival = 1; self-report = 0)

−.327, p = .000). Direct CSR (self-report) measure has a larger effect than indirect CSR (archival) measure on business performance.

We are also interested in the evolution of CSR’s influence on business performance in the past decade. In our meta-analytic regression model, we treated publication time as independent variables (from 2001 to 2015). Table 3 reports the results of meta-regression exploring the evolution of CSR over time. However, the regression coefficient is non-significant (β = −.002, n.s.). Therefore, we found no significant evolutionary tendency of CSR in East Asia.

# Discussion

Orlitzky et al. (2003) conducted the first meta-analysis on the relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance, but they focused mainly on Western studies. Twelve years ago in East Asia, the idea of CSR was less popular than it is today, so empirical research for East Asian CSR practice is rare. Today, however, research on CSR–business performance relationships in East Asian contexts is accelerating, although studies have been inconclusive so far (Barnett & Salomon, 2012). The time is now appropriate for a meta-analysis focused on CSR in East Asia.

In studying whether CSR is profitable in East Asia, our quantitative review suggests that CSR has an overall significant, positive relationship with business performance, both financial and operational, consistent with most prior studies (Cheung et al., 2010; Choi et al., 2010; Cole et al., 2006; Oh et al., 2011) but different from Li and Zhang (2010) and Cao (2011). In addition, we find CSR exerts a stronger positive effect on operational performance than on financial performance.

Interestingly, our meta-analysis demonstrates several unique findings on East Asian CSR practices which are different from Western countries. For instance, based on 52 Western background studies and a total sample size of 33,878 observations, Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) meta-analysis found that corporate environmental performance has a smaller relationship with corporate financial performance. While, our results diverge from Orlitzky et al. (2003) in that we find environmental CSR to have a stronger positive affect than social CSR on business performance in our East Asia samples. We suggest that the West/East divergence occurs because social CSR and environmental CSR have different importance in East Asia than they have in Western countries. While Western countries focus more on social CSR, during the past decade some East Asian developing regions, such as China, have been heavy manufacturers for the world, with the accompanying environmental pollution problems. That is, green signals (environmental CSR) are more attractive to East Asian stakeholders, while good signals (social CSR) are more attractive to Western stakeholders. Therefore, East Asian firms’ stakeholders are expressing more concerns about the natural environment, accounting for the focus on environmental CSR.

Moreover, previous CSR literature seldom considered the role of contingencies such as institutional systems and culture. Our findings also confirm that economic development, firm size, organizational form, and measurement mode moderated CSR effects on business performance. These findings suggest that CSR is highly valued in East Asian developing countries, especially in China. Private firms rely more on CSR to obtain resources for enhanced competitiveness. Because scholars seldom explored the

# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?

In the evolution of CSR’s value, we tried to investigate the evolutionary tendencies but failed to find significant results, which indicates that CSR practice were consistently important in East Asia over the past decade.

Intriguingly, our Asian samples suggest that CSR has a stronger positive effect on performance for small firms than it has for large firms, in contrast to Marín et al. (2012) who argued that large firms in Spain are more visible to stakeholders and more likely to consider their demands. There are two reasons to explain this West/East divergence. One plausible reason for the difference may be the different development stage of CSR. In Western countries, CSR practices have been a pervasive and frequent activity during decades of development. Western companies, even the small ones, have the tradition to disclose CSR information to stakeholders. The differences of information asymmetry are not distinct between large firms and SMEs. But CSR in some East Asian regions is still in the beginning stages. CSR signals sending from small and private firm can attract numerous stakeholders’ attention. Another reason may be the different institutional environments. Institutional theory explains that institutional environments are crucial contingencies that can change the influence of institutions on firm performance. Because East Asia has an informal and weak institutional environment, East Asian SMEs would practice CSR to gain political ties with government and secure better protection. In general, we believe that firm size has a different moderating effect in the CSR–firm performance relationship in East Asian contexts than it has in Western countries.

Also, Marín et al. (2012) found that service and manufacturing industries experienced similar CSR effects. Our assumption that industry setting is a moderator was similarly rejected, overturning previous ideas that industry characteristics are potential determinants of CSR–business performance relationships (Reverte, 2009; Werther & Chandler, 2006). The reason that we failed to find the moderating role of industry setting is that both green signal and good signal are important to East Asian stakeholders. Collectively, this meta-analysis provides several valuable theoretical contributions and practical implications.

# Theoretical contributions

Combining signaling theory with institutional theory, we find sufficient reasons to support an overall positive association between CSR and business performance in East Asia as our baseline hypothesis. We make several contributions to research on CSR in East Asia in particular and to the field of business ethics as a whole. First, this meta-analysis expands the application of signaling theory and institutional theory. We try to apply signaling theory into the research of East Asian CSR practices, and argue that signaling theory is another powerful theoretical foundation that can explain the value of CSR. According to signaling theory, CSR signals can transfer information about firm’s unobserved attributes (e.g., CSR attitude and stakeholder influence capacity) to customers, suppliers, government, and other stakeholders. This information is crucial for stakeholders to evaluate the firm’s attitude towards environmental and social issues. Especially, CSR practice signals can help firms obtain a premium from stakeholders and sometimes make up the institution deficiency in China and other East Asian emerging economies (Surroca et al., 2010). The viewpoint and results of this study are consistent with former research findings. Previous studies agree that CSR actives are a kind of organizational strategic investment to build close connection with diverse stakeholders and acquire their support. Firm with better social performance can acquire.

M. Hou et al.

More intangible resources, including organizational culture, reputation, and human resources that give them competitive advantage (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998). Different from above viewpoints related to stakeholder theory and the resource-based view, our signaling perspective emphasizes the signaling role of CSR practices in dealing with information asymmetry. Specifically, by integrating empirical results across 28 empirical studies, we make conclusions about the overall value of CSR in driving business performance in East Asia. We show that CSR is, indeed, a valuable business strategy in the East Asian context. Moreover, our meta-analysis reveals that environmental CSR has a stronger positive effect on firm performance than does social CSR. Distinguishing between environmental and social aspects of CSR is important because they involve two different groups of stakeholders and have different Western/Asian relative strengths. Our unique research findings emphasize the value of environmental CSR signals in East Asia and enrich the CSR literature. Following Venkatraman and Ramanujam (1986) and Hult et al. (2008), we decompose business performance into financial (financial and market indicators) and operational (competitive and societal indicators) performance, to examine CSR’s distinct influence on each type of business performance. The approach enables us to compare distinct CSR impacts on financial vs. operational performance, and gain a more comprehensive understanding of CSR’s value in East Asian contexts. The results indicate that CSR exerts a relatively small influence on financial performance and that CSR endeavors can allow firms enjoy stronger operational performance. The findings are important and timely as they strengthen our understanding of CSR’s effects in East Asia, where business is characterized by fast growth, fierce environmental problems, and savage competition.

Second, this paper adopts the institutional theory to explore the contingencies of CSR-performance relationship. Drawing on stakeholder theory, natural resource-based view (NRBV), and other theoretical lenses, previous studies have found the positive effects of CSR practices on business performance (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Surroca et al., 2010). However, they neglected the moderating role of institutional environments. From the combined view of signaling theory and institutional theory, we argue that the positive effect of CSR practices signals may vary in different contexts. When the institutional system is deficient, CSR signals can resolve the information asymmetry more effectively. Similarly, the phenomenon of information asymmetry is more prominent in SMEs and private firms. Therefore, CSR signals are more valuable for these firms. In contrast, as the institutional environment becomes more perfect and firm’s information is easily to access (e.g., developed regions and public firms), the signaling role of CSR practices will become less valuable because stakeholders can access other non-CSR information to evaluate firms. Specifically, following Barnett and Salomon’s (2012) call for exploring additional contingencies in the relationship between CSP and CFP, we undertook this meta-analytic review to examine the prediction of stakeholder theory in various contexts. Different levels and types of contingencies allow us to understand the contextual and methodological moderators between CSR and business performance in East Asia more comprehensively. First, we find that economic development moderates CSR effects on business performance. This indicates that CSR is a better approach for firms in developing regions to improve business performance, consistent with the argument that CSR may depend on the economic environment along with different levels of institution and legal development (Arya & Zhang, 2009). This research finding enriches the literature of CSR and the institutional theory. We also show that firm size moderates.

# Does CSR practice pay off in Asian firms?

The effect of CSR on business performance: SMEs rely more on CSR than do non-SMEs to gain necessary resource support and legitimacy from outside, a finding consistent with Dixon-Fowler et al. (2012). Additionally, we find that organizational form moderates CSR effect on business performance. Consistent with our prediction, CSR is more beneficial for private firms than for public firms, perhaps because most public firms perform CSR according to regular norms, but the few private firms that actively participate in CSR are differentiated once stakeholders and society as a whole know about their CSR endeavors.

Third, we find that using archival data has different outcomes than using self-report measures. Specifically, self-report measures have a larger effect size. As a result, our findings diverge from Dixon-Fowler et al. (2012). Future scholars are encouraged to adopt appropriate CSR measures for different research motivations. In addition, current CSR literature rarely takes longitudinal research into consideration because of the difficulty of data collecting (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2012). We try to explore the evolution of CSR in East Asia regions with the help of meta-regression. However, the results failed to demonstrate a significant regressive effect.

# Practical implications

This research may provide some useful guidelines regarding CSR endeavors for managers of Asian firms. CSR activities require substantial investment and can be costly (Hull & Rothenberg, 2008). Thus, understanding whether and under what conditions CSR enhances business performance is financially meaningful to East Asian managers who have been practicing or are being advised to practice CSR. This study argues that organizations adopt CSR activities to transfer good and green signals to outside stakeholders, solve the information asymmetry, and get positive responses from stakeholders. For instance, public firms and large firms are used to disclose their CSR reports every year. Several restaurants in China are pleased to show the cooking process to diners (green signals) in order to demonstrate the transparency and safety of their food. Our meta-analytic review indicates that CSR is a strategic signal East Asian firms can use to enhance business performance, especially for gaining competitive indicators such as reputation and innovation, and social indicators such as employee loyalty and customer satisfaction, indicating that CSR activities are strategically worthwhile investments. Managers in East Asia should focus on environmental CSR because it is more important than social CSR in the East Asian context. However, CSR is not a panacea for improving business performance because it is contextually relied. For instance, our research findings suggest SMEs in developing Asian countries, especially private firms, should consider CSR to acquire competitive advantage. In addition, with the development of globalization, more and more multinational companies (MNCs) prefer to enter East Asia markets. Therefore, the unique and important role of CSR in East Asia is crucial for MNCs. For instance, Carrefour, Tesco, and other Western companies need to realize the fact that environmental CSR is more important in East Asia.

# Limitations and future research directions

This meta-analytic study has several limitations that must be considered. First, CSR has many definitions capturing, for example, the ethic aspect, stakeholder dimension, economic dimension, and voluntary dimension, and each type of CSR may have.

# Conclusion

In recent years, scholars have turned their attention to corporate social responsibility in East Asia and have produced a cumulating yet fragmented body of empirical studies. The time is therefore appropriate to focus, review, and explore the CSR–business performance relationship in East Asian contexts by meta-analysis. Our meta-analytic review of 28 East Asian-based empirical studies, together with extensive discussions and future research suggestions, may furnish a reference for further theory development and empirical analysis in this field. We find that CSR continues to play a prominent role in facilitating business performance, especially operational performance. Interestingly, CSR may have stronger implications for small, privately owned businesses in the developing parts of East Asia such as China. We hope our study will inspire future research on CSR in East Asia.

# Abstract

Research on the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has consistently grown and is gaining widespread attention. Given the vast body of CEP–CFP studies, recently scholars have begun to take stock of the cumulative results. However, no study so far has meta-analyzed the findings yielded by event studies assessing the stock market reactions to corporate environmental performance-related events (CEP-related events). This paper sets out to close this gap by synthesizing previous empirical results regarding the stock market impact of positive and negative CEP-related events. Results indicate a positive relationship across studies in terms of positive market reactions to positive events and negative reactions to negative events. Furthermore, the findings show that the market reactions are stronger for negative events than for positive events (i.e., asymmetry in the stock market reaction). Finally, this study examines whether methodological artifacts (i.e., differences in the study designs) may explain the differences in the findings of the analyzed event studies.

# Introduction

Research on the relationship between corporate environmental performance (CEP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has been burgeoning for years and is still expanding. A plethora of empirical studies has been examining the CEP–CFP link and the question whether it “pays to be green” continues to receive unabated attention in both general media (e.g., Diamond 2009; Elgin 2007) and scholarly publications. Moreover, corporate practitioners are increasingly faced with external pressures from different stakeholders to behave responsibly toward the natural environment (Flammer 2013). According to the latest global survey of CEOs provided by Accenture and UN Global Compact (UNGC), 93 % of the 1000 surveyed CEOs believe that sustainability will be important or “very important” to the future success of their business (UNGC and Accenture 2013).

While research rooted in neoclassical economics proposed that any discretionary efforts toward improvements of CEP would decrease profits and thus violate shareholder value maximization (e.g., Friedman 1970; Jensen 2002); other scholars have challenged this view by putting

forward arguments for a positive impact of CEP on CFP. In particular, stakeholder theory (e.g., Donaldson and Preston 1995; Freeman 1984; Parmar et al. 2010) and the natural resource-based view (NRBV; e.g., Hart 1995; Hart and Dowell 2011) provided the theoretical grounds for postulating a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. However, empirical examinations have long yielded mixed results, ranging from findings indicating a negative relationship (e.g., Cordeiro and Sarkis 1997; Fisher-Vanden and Thorburn 2011), to non-significant findings (e.g., Cohen et al. 1997; Graves and Waddock 1999), up to findings suggesting a positive relationship between both focal constructs (e.g., Flammer 2013; Russo and Fouts 1997).

Due to the substantial body of empirical work concerned with the CEP–CFP link, scholars have begun to take stock of the cumulative results. Three meta-analyses have recently addressed the relationship between CEP and CFP (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat et al. 2014).1 In essence, the meta-analytic results suggest a modest positive relationship which, however, appears to be quite complex and subject to several moderation effects arising for example from different measurement approaches, causal ambiguity, and methodological issues (Endrikat et al., 2014). Broadly, empirical research has used three different types of methodologies for examining the CEP–CFP relationship: (1) portfolio analyses comparing the financial performance of model portfolios of firms with high CEP and low CEP, (2) multivariate analyses using multiple regression approaches or structural equation models, and (3) event studies assessing the stock market impact of positive or negative corporate environmental performance-related events (CEP-related events) (de Haan et al. 2012; Salzmann et al. 2005). The event study methodology appears particularly appropriate for examining the CEP–CFP relationship due to several reasons; for example, by focusing on stock market returns, event studies imply a forward-looking perspective on the financial consequences of CEP. Moreover, event studies evade the issue of endogeneity and are quite unambiguous with regard to the causal direction of the relationship. However, while the results of studies based on portfolio analyses and multivariate analyses have been captured by the above-mentioned meta-analyses, thus far no attempt has been made towards an integration and consolidation of the empirical evidence provided by event studies.

1 In addition, there are several meta-analyses regarding the relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and CFP (e.g., Allouche and Laroche 2005; Orlitzky et al. 2003). As CEP can be considered a dimension or a component of the broader construct of CSP (e.g., Busch and Hoffmann 2011; Orlitzky et al. 2003), the CSP–CFP meta-analyses partly captured the CEP–CFP link by means of subgroup analysis.

In an effort to remedy this deficiency, this paper provides a meta-analysis that accumulates 53 effect sizes derived from 32 studies concerned with stock market reactions to CEP-related events. Meta-analysis, a tool for quantitatively synthesizing the findings across a number of studies, has become increasingly common in management research (Combs et al. 2011; Geyskens et al. 2009; van Essen et al. 2012). Particularly in cases where inconsistent findings impede any generalizations, it has become the methodology of choice for establishing consensus (Geyskens et al. 2009; van Essen et al. 2012).

The current study makes three contributions. First, it contributes to the “Does it pay to be green?” debate by complementing the existing CEP–CFP meta-analyses and thus completing the body of cumulative evidence regarding the relationship between CEP and CFP. Moreover, given the advantageous properties of the event study methodology, a meta-analytically derived significant population effect would provide a rather clear indication of an impact of CEP on CFP ruling out potential reverse causality. This is of particular importance because the direction of causality (i.e., whether causation runs from CEP to CFP or vice versa) still represents a disputed issue (e.g., Endrikat et al. 2014; Molina-Azorín et al. 2009; Nakao et al. 2007). Second, picking up anecdotal evidence, which suggests stronger market reactions to negative events compared with positive ones, this work offers theoretical reasoning for this phenomenon and incorporates this issue in the meta-analytic investigation. Finally, by conducting exploratory moderator analyses (Geyskens et al. 2006; Kirca et al. 2012), this article examines potential moderation effects arising from methodological artifacts such as different study design and sample characteristics.

This paper is organized as follows. First, the theoretical background is presented from which the hypotheses are derived. Second, the data as well as the methodology employed are explained. The presentation of the results of the analyses follows. Finally, the findings are discussed and important implications highlighted.

# Background and Development of Hypotheses

# CEP-Related Events and the Link between CEP and CFP

The event study methodology was developed in finance (e.g., Brown and Warner 1985) and has been widely applied in management research (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Event studies examine whether there are abnormal stock price effects due to announcements of unanticipated events or changes with regard to managerial decisions (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999). The crucial assumption underlying event studies refers to the efficient

# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events

Market hypothesis, which proposes that markets are able to anticipate and correctly interpret relevant news and quickly adjust security prices (Fama 1991; Frooman 1997). While it is commonly known that stock markets are not information perfect, they are considered to work with a high degree of efficiency and accuracy by continually assessing and valuing new information (Frooman 1997; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). Therefore, in cases of major events, abnormal returns (ARs) or cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) (i.e., significantly greater positive or negative returns) that accrue for the particular firm allow inferring that the event significantly influences the value of the firm (Frooman 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999).

The earliest event study examining ARs as consequence of CEP-related events, to the best knowledge of the author, was provided by Shane and Spicer (1983). They examined how the stock market reacted to releases of pollution control reports by the Council on Economic Priorities and found relatively large negative ARs especially for firms with low pollution control performance. Another prominent example is the study of Klassen and McLaughlin (1996), who analyzed the market reactions to (1) third-party announcements of environmental awards signaling superior CEP and to (2) environmental crises (e.g., oil spills) signaling weak CEP. They found significant positive returns for firms receiving an environmental award and significant negative returns for firms involved in an environmental crisis. While the majority of earlier studies focused on the US and usually examined announcements associated with pollution information, in recent times several event studies have been conducted in other institutional settings (e.g., Gupta and Goldar 2005; Xu et al. 2012) and incorporated a broader range of CEP-related events. For example, Gilley et al. (2000) provided an event study focusing on the announcement of product- and process-driven environmental initiatives. While they found no overall effect of such announcements on stock returns, the results of their study suggest differences in the market reaction with regard to the specific type of the environmental initiative announced. In particular, the stock market reacted more positively to product-driven initiatives compared to process-driven initiatives. Robinson et al. (2011) investigated how the stock market reacted to the inclusion of firms in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and found significant increases in market value for the firms being included in the index. Keele and DeHart (2011) examined the market reactions to the announcement of firms’ participation in the USEPA Climate Leaders program and found no statistically significant market reaction on the day of the announcement.

It is worth mentioning that the efficient market hypothesis is not free from criticism. In particular, behavioral finance scholars have challenged the different forms of the efficient market hypothesis (e.g., Shleifer 2000).

While the events examined by event studies are admittedly single discrete events, they signal cumulative environmental performance and future positioning to the marketplace (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). For example, an announcement of green supply chain initiatives can be considered a public signal with regard to a firm’s decision towards a proactive environmental strategy. This information is deemed to be rapidly impounded in the stock price so that a change in its value implies a change in the market assessment of a firm’s net present value and thus reflects the market’s perception of the financial impact of signaled CEP (Gilley et al. 2000; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996).

Several theoretical arguments have been put forward with regard to the relationship between CEP and CFP involving different manifestations and mechanisms (Guenther and Hoppe 2014). In particular, the early literature rooted in neoclassical economics (e.g., Friedman 1970; Levitt 1958) argued that environmental activities would withdraw financial resources from a firm and thus weaken its financial performance because the financial benefits of environmental activities are deemed to be lower than their costs. Furthermore, drawing on agency theory (Jensen and Meckling 1976), scholars suggested that managers could opportunistically employ corporate resources to engage in environmental activities that enhance their own utility at the expense of good financial performance (Brammer and Millington 2008). For instance, managers may try to justify disappointing financial outcomes by engaging in conspicuous environmental activities (Preston and O’Bannon 1997).

In contrast, other scholars have argued that CEP can have a positive impact on CFP. Porter (1991) and Porter and van der Linde (1995) noted that pollution can be seen as a waste of resources and thus the reduction of a firm’s environmental footprint may also strengthen its competitiveness leading to a “win–win” situation. In particular, the NRBV (e.g., Hart 1995; Hart and Dowell 2011) provides arguments for a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. According to the NRBV, a firm’s ability to address the increasing challenges imposed by the natural environment fosters the development of rare and inimitable organizational resources and capabilities (both tangible and intangible), leading to a competitive advantage and superior financial performance (Chan 2005; Hart and Dowell 2011). Thus, proactive environmental strategies focusing on pollution prevention and environmentally sound product development may entail the development of organizational resources and capabilities and stimulate organizational learning (e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997; Sharma 2000). Hence, improving CEP may help in attracting and retaining a higher quality workforce (Turban and Greening 1996), may foster innovativeness (Sharma and Vredenburg 1998; Surroca et al. 2010), and may enhance decision-making.

J. Endrikat

processes and other aspects of organizational culture (Hillman and Keim 2001; Sharma and Vredenburg 1998).

Along the lines of Freeman’s (1984) stakeholder theory, it has been proposed that firms’ engagement towards improving CEP can be seen as potentially instrumental in obtaining necessary resources or stakeholder support and in mitigating the likelihood of negative regulatory, legislative, or fiscal action (Buysse and Verbeke 2003; Cheng et al. 2014; Flammer 2013; Jones 1995). Thus, superior CEP can increase customer demand (Hart and Dowell 2011), may improve reputation (Hart 1995), can contribute towards gaining legitimacy as a “license to operate” (Porter and Kramer 2006, p. 81), may decrease financial risk (Peloza 2009), and attract financial resources from environmentally responsible investors (Consolandi et al. 2009; Heal 2005).

In sum, there are several channels and causal pathways through which CEP might positively affect CFP. Moreover, the meta-analytic results provided so far are in favor of a positive relationship between CEP and CFP. However, while these meta-analyses did not incorporate the data provided by event studies, a meta-analytic examination of event study results would be particularly useful because event studies, despite some critical issues concerning the proper design and sound application (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; McWilliams et al. 1999), exhibit several outstanding features.

First, focusing on stock market reactions obviates the need to analyze accounting-based measures of CFP, which may be subjected to potential manipulations due to choices regarding different accounting procedures (McWilliams and Siegel 1997; Richard et al. 2009). Moreover, while accounting-based measures of CFP are limited in that they entail a historical perspective (Hamann et al. 2013; Peloza 2009; Richard et al. 2009), stock market returns incorporate assessments of a firm’s prospective development and reflect the notion of external stakeholders, especially investors, regarding future performance (Fryxell and Barton 1990; Hamann et al. 2013). Thus, event studies imply a forward-looking view on the financial consequences of CEP. This point is of crucial importance because several potentially beneficial impacts of CEP are considered to accrue in the long term (Hart and Ahuja 1996; Peloza 2009). In addition, stock market returns also incorporate intangible assets and reputation effects (Richard et al. 2009), which are obviously relevant given the theoretically proposed mechanism linking CEP and CFP.

Another advantage of event studies for examining the CEP–CFP link is that they can rather clearly determine the direction of causality (Heal 2005). While correlation and regression-based studies in most instances cannot rule out the possibility of reverse causality or endogeneity, issues that are likely to be at play in the relationship between CEP and CFP (Endrikat et al. 2014; Flammer 2013; Hart and Ahuja 1996; Surroca et al. 2010); event studies reasonably allow inferring causality running from CEP to CFP.3

Furthermore, as several third variables (either of moderating or mediating nature) have been suggested to be involved in the CEP–CFP link (Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Russo and Minto 2012), it is of crucial importance to control for such factors in empirical tests in order to ensure valid and reliable results.4 In this regard, event studies “are unusually precise because companies serve as their own matched control when its stock price is compared before versus after a news announcement” (Margolis et al. 2009, pp. 13–14).

Due to the advantageous properties of the event study methodology, a meta-analytic overall effect calculated from event studies would provide strong evidence with regard to the question whether CEP has an impact upon CFP and if this impact is positive or negative.

In view of the preceding considerations regarding the theoretical arguments and given the results of available meta-analyses, the following hypotheses are posited:

H1a Across the body of event studies, there is a positive stock market reaction to positive CEP-related events.

H1b Across the body of event studies, there is a negative stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events.

# Positive and Negative Events: Asymmetry in the Stock Market Reactions

There are several event studies, which have examined the stock market reactions to both positive and negative CEP-related events. Some of those studies found stronger stock market reactions (in terms of magnitude of the ARs or CARs) to negative events compared to positive events (e.g., Consolandi et al. 2009; Klassen and McLaughlin 1996; Lorraine et al. 2004). Thus, there seems to be some evidence that the market punishes firms in cases of negative CEP-related events to a greater extent than it values firms in cases of positive CEP-related events. In other words, the stock market reactions to CEP-related events appear to be asymmetric.

There may be several reasons for reverse causal links between CEP and CFP. For example, firms with superior CFP may be likely to possess slack resources that allow them to invest in environmental activities (e.g., Endrikat et al. 2014; Waddock and Graves 1997). Furthermore, also CEP related events themselves might be a trigger for causal links from CFP to CEP. For instance, negative stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events in time period one may initiate corporate environmental investments leading to improved CEP in time period two. (I would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for raising this point).

For example, previous empirical studies have revealed moderating effects of firm size (e.g., Sharma and Henriques 2005), innovation activities (e.g., Wagner 2010), or industry characteristics (e.g., Hull and Rothenberg 2008) and mediating effects of reputation (e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997), organizational culture (e.g., Surroca et al. 2010), or firm risk (e.g., Bansal and Clelland 2004).

# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events

Different non-exclusive explanations can be offered for this phenomenon. Psychological research, in particular research on impression formation (e.g., Anderson 1981), consistently indicates that individual impressions and judgments concerning particular events or situations are inordinately influenced by more negative information than by positive information (Baumeister et al. 2001; Skowronski and Carlston 1989). That is, humans weigh negative events more heavily than positive events (Jayachandran et al. 2013; Lankoski 2009). This pattern, denoted as negativity bias or positive–negative asymmetry effect, has been recognized and repeatedly confirmed in several research domains (Baumeister et al. 2001); for example, for the voting behavior in research in political science (e.g., Aragones 1997), for media attention in communication studies (e.g., Shoemaker et al. 1991), or for memorization processes in cognitive psychology scholarship (e.g., Robinson-Riegler and Winton 1996). In the field of economic psychology prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) it is highlighted that individual decision-making patterns imply that greater weight is accorded to costs than to gains. By means of experiments Kahneman and Tversky (1979) revealed that people care more strongly about a loss in utility than they do about a gain of equal magnitude (Soroka 2006). A study of Sen and Bhattacharya (2001) indicated that positive–negative asymmetries might also be relevant in the area of corporate social responsibility (CSR). In particular, they found that consumers’ company evaluations were more sensitive to negative CSR information than positive information. Similarly, Lankoski (2009), drawing on data from an executive survey, showed that corporate responsibility issues that reduce negative externalities entail stronger economic impacts than those that generate positive externalities.

Another explanation has been put forward by Klassen and McLaughlin (1996). They pointed to the fact that negative events such as environmental crises entail financial implications more obviously than positive CEP-related events. Thus, such events in addition to signaling poor CEP also forward information with manifested financial implications compared to positive events such as announcements of environmental awards.

Finally, preannouncement information asymmetry effects might explain asymmetric stock market reactions. Doh et al. (2010), examining the stock market reaction to the inclusion in or the deletion from the Calvert Social Index, found significant ARs for deletions from the index but no significant ARs for additions. They argued that information asymmetries prior to the announcement of additions and deletions might explain this difference. While firms with superior CSP would be likely to publicize pertinent information, firms with deteriorating CSP would tend to withhold such information. Thus, announcements of addition to, or deletion from, a social responsibility index may involve differing degrees of information novelty.

In view of these arguments, the following hypothesis is proposed:

# H2

Across the body of event studies, the stock market reaction to negative CEP-related events is stronger than the stock market reaction to positive CEP-related events.

# Data and Methodology

Multiple search strategies were employed for this research to collect studies examining the market reactions to positive or negative CEP-related events. First, searches were conducted in major electronic databases (Business Source Complete, Academic Search Complete, EconLit, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library) using several combinations of keywords. Second, the reference lists of the studies identified in step one were manually searched (i.e., employing an “ancestry” approach; Aguinis et al. 2011). Finally, the SSRN database was searched to find additional unpublished manuscripts.

In line with other meta-analyses aggregating the results of event studies, the statistical information provided in the studies has been used to calculate an inverse-variance weighted population r (e.g., Stahl and Voigt 2008). Consequently, to be included in the analysis the studies had to report statistics that allow the calculation of simple correlations. After excluding a number of studies that did not provide the necessary statistical information, the final sample included 32 event studies providing 53 effect sizes based on a total of 8660 observations. The studies included were published between 1990 and 2013. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the analyzed event studies.

In order to distinguish between market reactions to positive and negative CEP-related events, two separate meta-analyses were conducted. The analysis with regard to positive events was based on 27 effect sizes from 4449 observations. The analysis regarding negative events was

I conceived CEP-related events as incidents referring to environmentally friendly or environmentally harmful corporate actions or behavior. Thus, announcements of environmental regulations were not considered as events in the sense of this study.

Keywords included terms such as environment, environmental, pollution, polluting, ecology, sustainability, performance, market, return, financial, economic, and stock.

based on 26 effect sizes from 2172 observations. The population correlations (rs) were calculated by means of random effects models. Conﬁdence intervals were calculated at the 95 % level. To assess the homogeneity of the effect size distributions, Q B statistics were calculated (Hedges and Olkin 1985). Subgroup analysis was used in order to examine potential moderation effects (Hunter and Schmidt 1990). The complete samples for both positive and negative events were divided into subgroups referring to potential moderation effects and calculated separate meta-analyses for these subgroups (King et al. 2004).

First, the sample was split by distinguishing studies focusing on US firms and studies examining non-US firms. Although the majority of studies focused on US firms, scholars have recently begun to use samples drawn from other geographical regions (e.g., Gupta and Goldar 2005; Xu et al. 2012). Several factors which are likely to affect the market reactions to CEP-related events may originate from country-specific differences with regard to economic, social, legal, or political aspects. For instance, the level of a country’s economic development has been shown to determine the general degree and enforcement of environmental regulations (Dinda 2004; Grossman and Krueger 1995), which may influence the extent to which environmental issues constitute potential threats to organizational legitimacy (Zhu et al. 2007). Moreover, general attitudes concerning environmental issues that may affect investors’ reactions to CEP-related events strongly depend on national contexts (e.g., Baughn et al. 2007; Kilbourne et al. 2002).

Second, the studies were distinguished between studies examining events that occurred before the year 2000 and studies examining events that have occurred since the year 2000. Environmental issues have been gaining momentum throughout the last decades in both academic research and business practice. For example, Jermier et al. (2006) surveyed scholarly journals cataloged in the ABI/Inform Global database and observed an increase of more than 300 % in the number of publications related to the field of organizations and the natural environment from the period 1990–1994 to 2000–2004. Furthermore, from 1995 to 2012, the size of the US SRI market, measured in total.

In cases of sample periods involving years before and after the year 2000, the studies were coded according to the main emphasis of the sample period.

assets under professional management, increased by 486 % (Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment 2012). Given the significantly increased relevance of environmental issues, it is likely that the stock market reactions to CEP-related events have changed since the 1990s. The year 2000 was chosen for splitting the samples because the DJSIs, the first global sustainability equity indexes, were launched in September 1999.

Third, the sample was divided according to whether the study explicitly mentioned that it accounted for confounding events or whether the study failed to do so. According to McWilliams and Siegel (1997), confounding events constitute the most critical issue with regard to the event study methodology. Confounding events are firm-specific events, other than the focal event, that occur during the event window and might have an impact on the firm’s stock price. Such events can include dividend declarations, announcements of an impending merger, signings of major contracts, announcements of new products, filings of large damage suits, announcements of unexpected earnings, or changes with regard to key executive positions (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Concerns regarding confounding events can be addressed by screening for potentially confounding events and excluding the relevant observations from the analysis.

Finally, this work distinguished between effect sizes derived from ARs and effect sizes derived from CARs. ARs represent the difference between expected returns and actual returns, or in other words, returns earned by firms adjusted for the “normal” return process (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). ARs are usually measured on day zero (i.e., the date of the respective event) or on day 1 (i.e., the day following the respective event). CARs are calculated by cumulating ARs over a certain period of time, the so-called event window. Thus, CARs are assumed to measure the average effect of an event on the firm’s stock price (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). However, the use of CARs may exacerbate the problem of confounding events, especially if long event windows are used (McWilliams and Siegel 1997). Furthermore, with regard to effect sizes calculated from CARs, this work distinguished between CARs calculated over the traditional 3-day event window (-1, 1) and CARs calculated over longer event windows.

A common issue regarding the meta-analytic methodology is manifested by the so-called publication bias or file-drawer problem. The file-drawer problem rests on the assumption that the decision for submitting or publishing studies is influenced by the presence or absence of statistically significant results in such a way that statistically non-significant findings are less likely to be published (Begg 1994; Dalton et al. 2012; Geyskens et al. 2009).

Consequently, meta-analytic calculations may yield upwardly biased results. To account for the file-drawer problem, I calculated the fail–safe k, which provides an estimate of the number of null-effect studies that would be needed to make the summary effect insignificantly (Rosenthal 1979).

With regard to the other subgroup analyses, no statistically significant moderation effects were found. However, for proofing that the difference was statistically significant, I conducted an additional meta-analysis including both effect sizes for positive and negative events as separate subgroups whereby the sign of the effect sizes for negative events has been reversed. The QB indicated a significant difference (QB = 200.360, p < .01).

Some observations might be worth mentioning. First, regarding both positive and negative events the stock market reactions tend to be slightly stronger for non-US samples than for US samples (positive events: r = .053, 95 % CI: .001 to –.106 for US samples vs. r = .092, 95 % CI: .008 to –.175 for non-US samples, negative events: r = -.164, 95 % CI: -.230 to -.096 vs. r = -.228, 95 % CI: -.339 to -.110). Second, while the population rs pertaining to negative events were similar for events before the year 2000 and events as of 2000, the r regarding positive events before the year 2000 was not significant (r = .032, 95 % CI: -.054 to –.117), contrary to the r pertaining to positive events as of the year 2000 (r = .077, 95 % CI: .023 to –.131). Finally, for negative events, both the r calculated from studies which controlled for confounding events as well as the r derived from studies not accounting for this issue were significant (r = -.139, 95 % CI: -.22 to -.054 and r = -.219, 95 % CI: -.298 to -.137). For positive events, only the r calculated from studies that controlled for confounding events was significant (r = .093, 95 % CI: .030 to –.156). To some extent these partially non-significant effects regarding positive events may be a further indication that the stock market reactions to negative events are more robust and generalizable than those to positive events.

# Discussion and Conclusion

Several studies examined the market reactions to CEP-related events and yielded mixed results. In an attempt to reconcile this inconsistency, the current work accumulated the empirical evidence of 29 event studies by means of meta-analysis. This study adds to the established body of cumulative evidence concerning the CEP–CFP link as it complements the existing meta-analyses (Albertini 2013; Dixon-Fowler et al. 2013; Endrikat et al. 2014), which did not incorporate event study findings. Overall, my results corroborate the existing meta-analytic evidence of a positive relationship between CEP and CFP by demonstrating.

J. Endrikat

that there is a positive market reaction to positive CEP-related events and a negative reaction to negative events. Moreover, due to the nature of event studies, these meta-analytically derived estimates indicate a positive causal impact of CEP on CFP. CEP-related events indeed appear to alter the market’s perception of firms’ net present values of future profits and cash flows (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). However, what is not clear from the current meta-analysis is the exact reason why CEP-related events change the stock market’s perception of future firm value. Along the lines of the NRBV and the stakeholder theory, it could be argued that CEP-related events are effective in signaling a firm’s competitive resources and capabilities and its potential effectiveness in meeting stakeholder demands. Nevertheless, which potential benefits from superior CEP and which detriments from poor CEP are in particular valued or punished by the market remains to be established.

Furthermore, the findings suggest that there is asymmetry in the stock market reactions with stronger reactions to negative than to positive CEP-related events. The asymmetry can be explained in the light of the so-called negativity bias, a pattern that may be “one of the most basic and far-reaching psychological principles” (Baumeister et al. 2001, p. 362). To this end, the findings are in line with insights from economic psychology indicating asymmetric evaluations of potential losses and gains (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Hence, the stock market reactions to CEP-related events might just mirror a general cognitive pattern. However, from a more specific point of view, it can be argued that negative CEP-related events such as announcements of violations of environmental laws (e.g., Karpoff et al. 1998) or toxic releases (e.g., Hamilton 1995) demonstrate poor CEP in a clear and explicit manner. Thus, negative CEP-related events appear to constitute strong and (adversely) value-relevant signals for the shareholders. Contrarily, positive CEP-related events such as announcements of green supply chain initiatives (Bose and Pal 2012) or engagement in the EPA’s Climate Leaders program (Keele and DeHart 2011) strictly speaking may just represent a firm’s efforts not necessarily implying actual superior CEP. Accordingly, positive CEP-related events might not in all cases entail information that is sufficient to alter the shareholder’s evaluation of firm value. In addition, the asymmetric stock market impacts of positive and negative CEP-related events might be explained by information asymmetries prior to the events. Superior CEP might be already factored in by the markets, as firms with superior CEP are likely to publicize pertinent information, while poor performing firms would tend to withhold such information so that the “surprise” effect is much stronger for negative events (Consolandi et al. 2009; Doh et al. 2010). Future research may expand on the asymmetry issue and explore the reasons for the asymmetric market reactions to CEP-related events in more detail.

With regard to the examination of potential moderation effects, this work only found a significant moderation effect for the length of the event windows. For negative events the population r for longer windows was significantly smaller than that for the (-1, 1) window. For positive CEP-related events only the population r for the (-1, 1) window was significant while a significant population r for longer event windows was not found. From a theoretical point of view, this finding further highlights the more material effect of negative CEP-related events compared to positive events. Negative CEP-related events appear to entail stock market reactions that are stronger and more persistent over time compared with the reactions to positive events. Moreover, from a methodological point of view, this finding provides support for the recommendations of McWilliams and Siegel (1997) to use event windows that are as short as possible. Contrary to the argument of Barnett and King (2008) proposing that the market may need some time to capture the full impact of certain events, the current findings suggest that the market is able to factor in the information revealed by CEP-related events rapidly.

However, it is worth mentioning that the length of the event window was the only statistically significant moderation effect that was detected in the current work. While the width of the confidence intervals and the significance of the Q statistics for most of the subgroups indicated that the variation of the findings of the event studies included in the analysis was above that expected by chance, the subgroups failed to capture these effects. That means, while subgroup analyses indicated the presence of moderation effects, the particular effects could not be specified.

The failure of the present meta-analysis to reveal moderation effects that would adequately explain the observed heterogeneity clearly suggests a need for further research to identify moderation effects, attributed to both methodology and theory that may explain the variation in the study findings. For example, scholars may explore whether country-specific differences may entail moderation effects regarding the stock market reactions to CEP-related events. The current meta-analysis showed that regarding both positive and negative events the stock market reactions seem to be slightly stronger for non-US samples than for US samples. Since several factors that are likely to influence stock market reactions to CEP-related events are dependent on country-specific institutional contexts (e.g., Bansal and Roth 2000; Baughn et al. 2007; Etzion 2007), future research exploring the national context-specific mechanisms that may account for the differences in more detail might yield important insights.

# Market Reactions to CEP Related Events

Another interesting avenue for future research may refer to the frequently expressed notion that the market’s awareness regarding environmental issues has increased over time (e.g., Consolandi et al. 2009; Flammer 2013). The findings of the current study point in this direction as the population r calculated across studies examining stock market reactions to positive events that occurred before the year 2000 was not significant, contrary to market reactions to positive events occurring after the year 2000. Related to this, and probably even more interesting, is the question of why the increase in market reactions to CEP-related events seems to apply only to positive events but not to negative ones. Contrary to the finding regarding positive events, the rs pertaining to negative events were similar for events before the year 2000 and events as of 2000. This suggests that the stock market reactions to negative events may have not been subject to changes over time, while the reaction to positive events constitute a more recent phenomenon. One potential explanation may be that the negative financial effects of poor CEP arising from reputational damages or impeding fines and remediation costs have been well established for some time, while the beneficial effects of superior CEP resulting from competitive resources or improved stakeholder relationships have only recently been taken into consideration due to an increased attention on sustainability issues.

Finally, future research could also focus on the differences with regard to the specific events examined in the event studies. In view of the fact that CEP must be considered a multidimensional construct (Trumpp et al. 2015) it is obvious that also CEP-related events address quite different aspects of CEP. Therefore, one potential reason for the variation of the study results may refer to the variety of different events such as environmental awards and crises (Klassen and McLaughlin 1996), product- and process-driven environmental initiatives (Gilley et al. 2000), inclusion and exclusion from the DJSI (Consolandi et al. 2009), or membership in voluntary environmental initiatives (Keele and DeHart 2011). While it would have been interesting to explore whether the variation of the study findings might be attributed to the qualitative differences of the particular events, the very diversity of CEP-related events and, associated therewith, the small number of sufficiently similar studies did not allow constructing meaningful subgroups for contrasting the effect sizes in this regard.

To conclude, this study adds to the “Does it pay to be green?” debate by providing meta-analytic evidence for positive market reactions to positive CEP-related events and negative market reactions to negative CEP-related events. Thus, it indicates that CEP-related events affect the market’s estimates of future cash flow. Furthermore, the meta-analytic results demonstrate that the market reaction is asymmetric in that the reaction is stronger for negative events than for positive events. Finally, the analyses indicate the presence of moderation effects that could not sufficiently be explained by the subgroup analyses that were feasible on the grounds of the available data. Thus, this study entails the need for further research on this topic.

# Abstract

Finance research has shaped the modern financial system, influencing investors and market participants directly through research findings and indirectly through teaching and training programmes. Climate change presents major risks to the global financial system as well as new opportunities for investors. Is climate finance an important topic in finance research? We systematically analyse the content of 20,725 articles published in the leading 21 finance journals between January 1998 and June 2015. We find that only 12 articles (0.06%) are related in some way to climate finance. The three elite finance journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics and Review of Financial Studies) did not publish a single article related to climate finance over the 17.5-year period. We repeat our analysis across a sample of 29 elite business journals spanning accounting, economics, management, marketing and operations research, as well as finance. We find a similar dearth of published climate finance research. We consider four possible explanations for this failure of top finance and business journals to engage with climate finance as a research topic. These include methodological constraints and editorial policies. We conclude by arguing why it is critical for climate-related research to be given greater attention and prominence in finance journals.

# 1 Introduction

Climate change presents both major risks to the global financial system and an opportunity for investors. Climate finance has become a defining topic in policy and practice, with major current debates around stranded fossil fuel assets, divestment from carbon-intensive stocks, the direct (physical) impact of climate change on assets, carbon markets, green investing and development finance, risk management strategies including climate insurance and broader.

financial stability risks (Dietz et al. 2016; Pauw et al. 2016; Batten et al. 2016; Griffin et al. 2015; Van Renssen 2014; Leaton 2011). There is no accepted taxonomy of climate finance, reflecting its emergent nature. However, common distinctions are made between mitigation or adaptation climate finance, and between public or private climate finance (Pauw et al. 2016).

In this paper, we explore whether climate finance is an important topic in finance research. Finance research is principally concerned with the functioning of private finance and so can help advance understanding of the interplay between financial markets and investors on the one hand and climate change on the other—be it related to mitigation or adaptation.

All the ‘core’ areas of finance research—asset pricing, corporate finance and investments—are relevant to climate change. As an illustrative example, the ‘asset pricing’ branch of finance research, which takes the perspective of traders, could help uncover to what degree investors are pricing carbon risk into asset values and is thus relevant to contemporary debates on stranded assets (Ansar et al. 2013; Carbon Tracker Initiative 2013, 2015; Dietz et al. 2016; Griffin et al. 2015; Leaton 2011). ‘Corporate finance’ researchers, who take the perspective of companies, could help establish whether energy majors have the balance sheets to support the financing of a capital-intensive low carbon transition (Tulloch et al. 2017). ‘Investments’ researchers can evaluate if climate-friendly investment funds or bonds outperform their alternatives on a risk-adjusted basis (Muñoz et al. 2014). Finance research in non-core areas can also contribute to understanding the relationships between private finance and climate change. Finance researchers concerned with insurance, risk management and financial institutions can help answer questions such as the following: what impact will rising sea levels have on real estate assets in large cities? What financial instruments can be used hedge carbon risk in investment portfolios? How exposed are banks to carbon risk, and banking systems more generally? (see Alexander 2014; Andersson et al. 2016; Batten et al. 2016; Carney 2015; Carbon Tracker Initiative 2013; de Jong and Nguyen 2016).

Leading climate change journals (including Nature Climate Change, Climatic Change and Global Environmental Change) have clearly engaged with climate finance topics (Dietz et al. 2016; Patenaude 2011; Pauw et al. 2016; Van Renssen 2014). One would similarly expect leading finance journals to have engaged with climate change.

We use systematic content analysis to identify climate change-related and climate finance-related articles in a sample of over 20,000 articles during a 17.5-year period since the Kyoto Protocol introduced global carbon markets. We repeat this analysis for a further sample of over 31,000 articles in elite business journals during the same time period to determine if our results are specific to finance journals, or are more broadly representative of accounting, economics, management and other business journals. Content analysis is a widely used method for characterising published textual material through simple quantitative descriptors such as the frequency of occurrence of a defined set of ‘codes’. The codes are linked to specific words, phrases or meanings of the textual content. Content analysis has recently been applied to large samples of journal articles to identify the disciplines, methods and concepts of energy-related social science (D’Agostino et al. 2011), the main findings of research on smart home technologies (Wilson et al. 2015) and the constituent types of low-carbon behaviour (Karlin et al. 2014).

We find a minimal level of engagement of finance and business journals with climate change-related and climate finance-related research, and we develop arguments as to why this might be the case. We conclude that this research gap is a major issue for advancing theory and practice in climate finance given the importance of finance research in shaping the modern financial system, in influencing investors and market participants and in teaching the next

generation of finance, investment, and business leaders. In so doing, we build on previous findings that business academics up to 2008 were slow to embrace climate change as a field of enquiry, although this research did not consider climate finance explicitly (Patenaude 2011; Goodall 2008).

# 2 Method: content analysis

We identified leading finance journals ranked B and above (Currie and Pandher 2011) and elite business journals rated 4* (ABS 2015). The samples comprised 21 finance journals (Table 1) and 29 elite business journals spanning accounting, economics, finance, management, marketing and operations research (Table 2). The top three finance journals were included in both samples (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies).

We used Scopus to search the content of these journals for articles on climate change (‘climate’ OR ‘global warming’ OR ‘greenhouse’ OR ‘carbon’). We searched titles, abstracts and keywords in all article types. The search period covered a 17.5-year period from January 1998 to June 2015. The Kyoto Protocol was signed in December 1997 and provides a clear milestone in international climate policy including the formation of carbon markets. All the journals in our two samples were indexed by Scopus over the full search period with three exceptions (Review of Finance, Quantitative Finance and Journal of Financial Research). Coverage of these journals in Scopus began in 2004, 2003 and 2003 respectively. We used journals’ own websites to search for articles in the period from January 1998 to these start dates to ensure no missing data.

A total of 36 articles in finance journals and 156 articles in elite business journals matched our search terms on climate change. We compiled metadata on all these articles and checked for spurious matches. Over half of all articles were spurious and not related to climate change (e.g. referring to a ‘changing economic climate’). Two members of the research team (IDR, BR) independently carried out these checks, with inter-coder reliability (Krippendorff’s alpha) of 0.8854. A bootstrap procedure generates lower and upper 95% CI of 0.7799 and 0.9600 respectively. Any coding differences were checked by the third member of the research team (CW) and resolved.

As shown in Fig. 1, our final samples comprised 12 articles in finance journals (after rejecting 24 spurious matches) and 74 articles in elite business journals (after rejecting 82 spurious matches).

To determine whether the articles in these final samples were related to climate finance, we searched the compiled metadata using a set of financial terms (‘financ*’ OR ‘balance sheet’ OR ‘asset’ OR ‘valu*’ OR ‘market’ OR ‘trade’ OR ‘trading’ OR ‘securit*’). A total of 12 (of 12) articles in leading finance journals and 25 (of 74) articles in elite business journals matched our climate finance-related search terms.

We coded each of these climate finance articles using a simple coding template which distinguishes key finance topics: (A) carbon markets; (B) value and performance (including stranded assets, green funds); (C) risk and risk mitigation (including hedging and insurance); (D) investments and opportunities (including green bonds); (E) corporate strategies (including carbon accounting, socially responsible investment) and (F) other (including carbon taxes, public climate finance). These topics were initially derived from an iterative process of reading the climate finance literature and reconciling this with established areas of finance research (for instance, commodity markets for topic A, risk management and insurance for topic C). For the

# Fig. 1

Number of climate change-related and climate finance-related articles in leading finance journals (top panel) and elite business journals (bottom panel). Note: Shaded areas are proportional to number of articles.

In coding, these topics were then refined and clearly defined so they were both discrete (non-overlapping) and exhaustive. In each case, we coded the main topic covered in the article.

To normalise our samples of climate change-related and climate finance-related articles, we used Scopus ‘Compare Journals’ statistics on the total number of articles published per journal.

A total of 20,725 articles were published in our sample of 21 finance journals from January 1998 to June 2015 (see Table 1).

A total of 31,351 articles were published in our sample of 29 elite business journals over the same time period (see Table 2).

# Climatic Change (2017) 143:243–260

To account for more recent interest in climate finance, particularly with respect to stranded assets, carbon bubbles and divestment, we created subsamples of articles published during the period January 2012 to June 2015 (see Appendix, Table 3). The Carbon Tracker published its first report in November 2011 which was a milestone in raising general awareness of climate finance topics (Leaton 2011).

# 3 Results

The results of our content analysis show a remarkable lack of engagement with climate change-related risks and opportunities by leading finance journals and elite business journals.

# 3.1 Climate change-related research

Table 1
shows that only 12 (0.06%) of the 20,725 articles published in the 21 leading finance journals (Currie and Pandher 2011) since 1998 have related in some way to climate change.

Furthermore, this almost complete lack of engagement with climate change as a research topic is not limited to finance. Table 2
similarly shows that only 74 (0.24%) of the 31,351 articles published by 4* ‘elite’ business journals (ABS 2015) over the same period addressed climate change-related issues (see also Fig. 1).
This research gap has scarcely improved in recent years as climate change has grown ever greater in relevance for finance. Over the period January 2012 to June 2015, only 0.10% (leading finance) and 0.49% (elite business) of articles published engaged with climate change (see Appendix, Table 3).

Among the elite business journals, we find that finance and marketing have not engaged with climate issues at all (see Table 2). We do find some limited engagement with climate change in elite journals from accounting, economics, management, operations research and ‘other’ business disciplines. Economics has engaged the most with climate topics, with all five elite journals having published at least one climate change-related paper and 0.5% of all publications addressing climate issues. However, it is noteworthy that of the 42 publications in economics, 36 come from one journal (America Economic Review). This highlights the importance of editorial policy in establishing journal norms (we return to this below).

The 21 leading finance journals have only published 12 climate change-related articles since 1998. Six of those were published since 2012 suggesting only a marginal increase in recent interest. Of the top ten journals, only the Journal of Banking and Finance has published climate-related articles (n = 4). The Journal of Risk and Insurance is the only other journal to have published more than one article (n = 2) (see Table 1). Other than the Journal of Banking and Finance, the journals that have published climate change-related articles tended to be towards the bottom of the ranking list. The three elite finance journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics and Review of Financial Studies) did not publish a single article related to climate change over the 17.5-year period. These findings are consistent with a recent review of ‘what’s hot’ in finance research for the four leading finance journals over the period 2011 to 2015 (see Bhattacharya et al. 2016). In the review, there is no mention of climate, carbon or environmental finance.

# 3.2 Climate finance-related research

All 12 climate change-related articles in leading finance journals were coded as also being climate finance-related. In addition, 25 of 74 climate change-related articles in elite business journals were similarly coded as being climate finance-related. Figure 1 summarises the coding of these climate finance-related articles. Just under half of the 37 climate finance-related articles addressed carbon markets; an additional 14% (the ‘other’ category) mainly addressed carbon taxes. This leaves an almost complete absence of research on critically important issues of risk, valuation (including stranded assets) and investment opportunities related to climate change.

We conclude overall that there is a dearth of climate finance-related research in leading finance journals, and that this small number of contributions are disproportionately focused on carbon markets. Elite business journals, in particular in the accounting, economics and operations research disciplines, have addressed climate finance-related topics to a very slightly greater extent (n = 25 vs. n = 12) and while these address a broader set of issues, they also tend to be dominated by research on carbon markets and carbon taxes (see Table 2).

It is instructive to provide some context for our headline findings that 0.06 and 0.08% of all articles published from 1998 to 2015 in leading finance journals and elite business journals respectively are on climate finance-related research. In other words, what other topics are finance journals covering? Financial intermediation (including banking and related regulatory issues) and market microstructure (the study of how exchange occurs in financial markets) respectively accounted for 8% and 3.7% of articles published in the Journal of Finance between 2011 and 2015 (Bhattacharya et al. 2016). Research on financial intermediation has clearly grown in importance due to the global financial crisis, while market microstructure has become more prominent as electronic and high-frequency trading have expanded across financial markets (see Diaz-Rainey et al. 2015). Both areas are distinct from the ‘core’ focus of finance research on asset pricing, corporate finance and investments, which together accounted for 67% of research in the Journal of Finance over the same period (Bhattacharya et al. 2016).

# 4 Discussion

It is striking that finance research is so ‘behind the climate curve’ given that investment professionals (Van Renssen 2014) and financial regulators (Batten et al. 2016; FSB 2016) are strongly engaged with climate finance topics. We offer four possible explanations.

First, contemporary critiques of finance research suggest the discipline is isolated and increasingly distanced from practice or the reality of financial markets (Focardi and Fabozzi 2012; Keasey and Hudson 2007). For instance, Focardi and Fabozzi (2012, pp. 108–109) observe that ‘[a] true empirical science would revise its models so that they fit empirical data. Financial economics, however, takes the opposite approach and considers deviations from an idealized economic rationality to be anomalies of the true empirical price processes’. Similarly, Keasey and Hudson (2007) observe that finance researchers are reluctant to engage with practice, leading them to conclude that finance theory is ‘a house without windows’. Accordingly, finance researchers seeking to publish in leading finance journals may be unaware of climate finance-related issues worthy of research attention. Among the leading finance journals, the two which are most practitioner-oriented have both published climate change-related articles. These are the Financial Analysts Journal (the Chartered Financial Analysts

# Climatic Change (2017) 143:243–260

Institute’s journal) and the Journal of Portfolio Management. Proximity to finance practice, and in particular to institutional investors, may help support engagement with climate change. Indeed, in 2016 (beyond our sample period), there have been two notable climate finance risk-related publications in the Financial Analysts Journal, namely Andersson et al. (2016) and de Jong and Nguyen (2016). The five authors involved in these two publications were practitioners or practitioners with ties to universities. None were ‘conventional’ finance academics.

Second, finance is essentially a mono method discipline (applied empiricism encased in rational agent theory) which is ill-suited to tackling forward-looking challenges arising from dynamic system change (Diaz-Rainey et al. 2015; Focardi and Fabozzi 2012; Keasey and Hudson 2007). This ‘limited domain’ problem (Diaz-Rainey et al. 2015) may explain why the climate finance-related research that has been published in leading finance journals has tended to focus on carbon markets, as rich time-series datasets are readily available. If so, leading finance journals face fundamental epistemological challenges to remain relevant within the climate context.

Third, incentives within finance research publication may steer academics away from climate finance topics. There may be a perception among finance academics that climate finance-related topics do not provide the opportunities for high impact general theory development that ‘core’ research in asset pricing, corporate finance and investments allows for and which tend to dominate the leading finance journals (see earlier discussion, and Bhattacharya et al. 2016). Further, established research agendas and high teaching loads among finance academics in universities may create inertia. There is high demand to study finance and a limited pool of faculty talent, partly as a result of alternative career opportunities in the finance industry. Thus, rather than undertaking ‘risky’ research in new fields such as climate finance that leading editors may not be receptive to, busy finance researchers focus on incremental knowledge in clearly recognised fields (Goodall 2008).

Fourth, and related to the previous points, researchers’ concerns that editors will not be responsive to climate finance topics may be well founded. This in turn may be related to leading finance professors (and journal editors) considering climate topics to be overly politicised (Goodall 2008). This effect may be accentuated by the US dominance of the finance discipline given the greater polarisation of views about, and scepticism towards, climate change in the US (Boussalis and Coan 2016; Painter and Ashe 2012; McCright and Dunlap 2011; Goodall 2008).

To explore this argument further, we identified the domiciles of the editorial teams of the 21 leading finance journals in our sample. We included co-editors, managing editors and executive editors but excluded associated editors. We assigned 0 (‘US’) or 1 (‘INT’) to a dummy variable coding for editorial teams that were exclusively US-based or that included at least one non-US domiciled editor respectively (see Appendix, Table 4). Of the 12 journals coded as international (INT), most included a combination of US and non-US editors reflecting the US dominance of the discipline. Only two journals had no US-based editors (Journal of Portfolio Management and Journal of Business Finance and Accounting). The phi coefficient of our dummy variable for all journals with at least one climate change-related publication and the INT dummy was 0.481 (significant at the 5% level). Leading finance journals publishing climate change-related research were categorised as having international editorial teams in all but one case (Journal of Futures Markets). We thus find a positive and statistically significant relationship between international editorial teams in leading finance journals and climate change-related research publications. This does not prove causality but does at least suggest that exclusively US-based editorial teams may play a role in limiting climate change-related research in leading finance journals.

# 5 Conclusion

Respected field journals such as Energy Economics have engaged strongly with climate finance-related research (Griffin et al. 2015). There are many climate finance initiatives in academia, including the Oxford Stranded Assets Programme and the new Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment, although tellingly the former is based in a geography department and the latter is not ranked by the business journal ranking lists (ABS 2015). So to be clear, we are not arguing that researchers are not engaging with climate finance. Rather, our concern is that elite business journals and leading finance journals have either not engaged at all or only engaged in a very limited sense. This has important implications for policy and practice.

High-profile publications in leading journals are important both for impact and academic career progression. Finance research is no different. Indeed, rewards and prestige in finance research are particularly concentrated (Currie and Pandher 2011; Fishe 1998) in the three elite journals (Journal of Finance, Journal of Financial Economics, Review of Financial Studies). As noted earlier, none of these journals published a single article related to climate change over the 17.5-year period of our sample. Emphasising their importance to the pursuit of knowledge generally, the three leading finance journals are placed among the top 100 journals in the world for all disciplines (according to 2016 SJR rankings).

Meaningful action to understand and address the impacts of climate change on the financial system requires the engagement of the best minds from academic finance and the attention of the leading journals that define the agendas in their fields. Leading finance journals should be publishing research on a range of climate finance-related topics including risks (e.g. speculative bubbles, financial contagion), valuation (e.g. carbon-risk disclosure requirements and related market impacts across numerous asset classes), opportunities (e.g. debt and equity market ‘green’ financing) and corporate strategies (e.g. divestments and used of hedging instruments).

Until the top journals in finance and business signal that they are receptive to climate finance-related research, the best finance researchers are unlikely to engage. Since the articles from leading finance journals tend to underpin the finance curriculums of undergraduate and especially postgraduate qualifications in finance, perhaps the most prominent impact of the dearth of climate finance-related research in leading finance journals is that the next generation of finance practitioners may be underprepared to tackle climate change-related issues.

What might be done to alleviate this situation? First, there needs to be a better understanding of why leading finance journals have not engaged with climate change. We have offered several possible explanations above, but surveys or interviews of finance academics could provide substantiating evidence. Roundtables and seminars where senior finance academics (especially editors) are introduced to climate finance topics might also help. In this respect, professional and regulatory bodies engaged with climate finance issues could play an important role in bringing academics to the table. The Chartered Financial Analysts Institute and the Financial Stability Board (especially its Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) could be possible conduits. Finally, research funders can help by creating dedicated funding streams for climate finance issues that require interdisciplinary teams including finance researchers.

Through the data and analysis presented here, we do not in any way seek to diminish finance research. We hope it can provide a stimulus to encourage leading finance researchers to engage with climate change and the many financial risks and opportunities it creates. That way, climate finance topics can benefit from the knowledge, methods and insights in finance research. This in turn will lead to better policymaking in what is surely one of the defining topics for finance and capital markets in the coming years and decades.

# Socially Irresponsible and Illegal Behavior and Shareholder Wealth

# A Meta-Analysis of Event Studies

# JEFF FROOMAN

# University of Pittsburgh

This article provides empirical results indicating that acting in a socially responsible and lawful manner is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for increasing shareholder wealth: It meta-analyzes 27 event studies that have measured the stock market's reaction to incidences of socially irresponsible and illicit behavior: It finds that for firms engaging in socially irresponsible & illicit behavior; the effect on shareholder wealth is negative (wealth decreases), statistically significant (p < .001), and so substantial in size (D = -932) that the distribution of abnormal returns is shifted nearly a full standard deviation to the left (i.e., negatively) from their expected standard normal distribution. This results in a socially responsible and law-abiding manner: It also provides support for a moral position called enlightened self-interest; which prescribes that firms should act in a socially responsible manner to promote the shareholders' interests.

Business and society scholars have spent decades wrestling with the economic assumption that people are rationally self-interested and try to maximize their personal welfare, especially in terms of monetary wealth. The problem is simple: If this is so, why would any business choose to be socially responsible, assuming that social responsibility costs a firm more than irresponsibility? Enlightened self-interested arguments for corporate.

Social responsibility (CSR) have focused on the long-term benefits of socially responsible behavior; benefits such as greater customer and employee loyalty, less regulation, and a more supportive external environment (e.g., Baumol, 1970; Committee for Economic Development; 1971; Steiner; 1972). Moral arguments have focused on the philosophical justifications for right behavior; with or without regard to consequences (e.g., Kant; 1785/1981; Mill, 1863/1992). Stakeholder arguments have focused on contractual and interest-based reasons for CSR (Clarkson; 1995; Evan and Freeman; 1988; Freeman; 1991). None of these positions, however, has generated convincing data in support of social responsibility. Furthermore, finance and economics research has been assumed to discount and discredit the CSR concept.

In this article, however, I show that empirical support for CSR is found in a surprising context: the finance literature based on the event study methodology. A meta-analysis of 27 event studies using CSR-related and law-related events yields the conclusion that socially irresponsible and illegal corporate acts result in substantial unrecovered decreases in shareholder wealth. This finding gives empirical weight to an enlightened self-interest argument for CSR and shows that markets do recognize and account for downstream costs (tangible and intangible) to the firm of socially irresponsible and unlawful behavior.

Enlightened self-interest as a reason for corporations to act in a socially responsible and lawful manner was developed by CSR theorists, including such researchers as Baumol (1970), Wallich and McGowan (1970), Committee for Economic Development (1971), Steiner (1972), and Davis (1973). In the words of the Committee for Economic Development (1971: 27), for instance, the doctrine of enlightened self-interest calls for "corporations to promote the public welfare in a positive way" because this is in the long-term interest of firms and shareholders.

Thus, the maxim of enlightened self-interest, as defined by these theorists, could be simply stated as:

- Proposition I: Firms ought to act in a socially responsible and lawful manner to increase shareholder wealth.

Proposition I is not a causal statement as in "A causes B:" It is simply a logical statement of the form "A implies B." That is, if firms act in a socially responsible and lawful manner, then shareholder wealth will increase. Ultimately, the field of business and society would like to support Proposition I. Empirically, however, no consistent support has been found for the proposition that CSR and lawful behavior are a sufficient condition.

for increasing shareholder wealth: However; there are data available ~the results of event studies -the nature of which lends itself to supporting a proposition that, ceteris paribus, CSR and lawful behavior are a necessary condition for increasing shareholder wealth. Of course, other factors can be assigned a role in generating shareholder wealth without detracting from the necessity of CSR and lawful behavior: This leads to the second proposition:

# Proposition 2

If firms do not act in a socially responsible and lawful manner; shareholder wealth is not increased.

Proposition 2 is a weak statement of the relationship between CSR, legal behavior; and shareholder wealth: It is also difficult to test empirically. Not acting in a socially responsible manner could mean acting irresponsibly, or it could mean acting in some "neutral" way that is not assessed within a responsibility/irresponsibility framework. Likewise, to say that shareholder wealth is not increased could be to say that shareholder wealth stays the same or decreases. Empirically, a workable test of Proposition 2 would be to assume that not acting in a socially responsible manner is equivalent to acting in a socially irresponsible manner; and then testing to see if shareholder wealth decreases. This leads to the third proposition:

# Proposition 3

If firms act in a socially irresponsible or illegal manner; shareholder wealth is decreased.

Although Proposition 3 is an oversimplification of reality, its strong grammatical form yields a conservative approach to testing indirectly the fundamental idea expressed in Proposition 2.

In short; the article presents an empirical analysis of the effects of socially irresponsible and illicit behavior on shareholder wealth, the results of which indicate that; ceteris paribus, Proposition 3 is a true statement. In other words, all other things equal, socially responsible and lawful behavior is necessary, though not sufficient; for shareholder wealth to be increased.

Of course, in one sense, a meta-analysis might be thought of as an empirical literature review because it quantitatively summarizes the re-

Results of previously published works. In this sense, the rest of this article might be seen as a lengthy literature review. However, this article does focus its attention exclusively on the results of only one type of previously published work—event studies. Event studies, though, are a very recent phenomena, and researchers have been looking at the link between social and financial (including market) performance for quite some time. Indeed, as far back as the early 1970s, Milton Moskowitz (1972) called for empirical proof to verify the commonly held belief that economic incentives could be used to motivate companies to be socially responsible.

During the 1970s and much of the 1980s, researchers published some 50 studies answering his call (Wood and Jones, 1995). The studies all sought a correlation between financial performance variables (e.g., accounting data, investor returns data, and risk data) and corporate social responsibility variables (e.g., existence and type of social programs; pollution performance, and reputation variables). Two previous review articles (Arlow and Gannon, 1982; Ullmann, 1985) that looked at many of these empirical studies found the results to be inconsistent; these two review articles, however, were done before anyone had begun applying event study methodology to the issue.

Event studies focus on a particular type of event—product recalls, for instance—and try to determine whether the stock market responds to the news of the event. In other words, at the time of a recall, does anything abnormal happen to the share price of a recalling firm, relative to how other stocks in the same risk class were performing at that time? To test for such "abnormal" behavior, event studies examine the effects of an event on many companies, never a single one. For example, an event study that considers the market's response to government-mandated automobile recalls (e.g., Bromiley and Marcus, 1989) does not look at a single recall by a single company on a single date. Rather, it looks at many recalls by all the companies in the industry over the course of many years. The sample of recalls is then statistically evaluated to see if across the sample the market reacted in a consistent manner (e.g., decreasing the value of firms recalling).

The theory underlying these event studies is the efficient markets hypothesis, originally proposed by Fama, Fisher, Jensen, and Roll (1969). The methodology was developed mainly by Fama (1970, 1976) and further refined by Brown and Warner (1980, 1985) and Dodd and Warner (1983). Meta-analysis is a quantitative review method used to synthesize the findings of previous empirical studies on an issue. Meta-analysis treats the results of each study it examines as a single data point. Because this article examines 27 event studies that have used incidences of socially responsible events...

data points. The technique of meta-analysis dates back as far as the 1930s, but it was not until the 1980s that social science researchers (e.g-, Glass, Jackson, 1982) began to refine the statistical techniques for their uses. The most up-to-date work on meta-analysis can be found in the edited volume by Cooper and Hedges (1994), which includes the approach to meta-procedures include a technique for meta-analyzing multilevel independent variables (Nouri and Greenberg, 1995), a technique for identifying outliers in data sets comprising correlation coefficients (Huffcutt and Arthur; 1995), and a technique for comparing the results of two meta-analyses using independent data sets (Alliger; 1995).

By meta-analyzing the results of event studies using socially irresponsible and illegal actions as their events, this article significantly extends the work of Arlow and Gannon (1982) and Ullmann (1985). This article is the first to collect event studies involving socially irresponsible and illegal behavior and the first to meta-analyze their results. It finds that; together, the 27 event studies produce a statistically significant result, indicating that substantial losses accrue to the shareholders of irresponsible and unlawful firms. In short; the wealth of shareholders does decrease when companies engage in socially irresponsible and illegal behavior;

# THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF A FIRM'S BEHAVIOR ON ITS STOCK PRICE

Although event studies may gauge the market's reaction only during the few days preceding and following reports of some action taken by a firm; the effect of the market's reaction to an event is not short-term in nature. Financial economists believe that any action taken by a firm permanently affects the value of that firm's stock (Brealey and Myers, 1996; Ross, Westerfield, and Jaffe, 1996).

Recall that share prices reflect the opinion of market participants regarding a firm's future cash flows. If participants believe that the future cash flows of a firm will decrease due to some behavior of the firm; demand for the stock will decrease, thus lowering the value of the stock. Later; if they believe that future cash flows will increase due to some new behavior of the firm; demand for the stock will increase, and this increased demand will drive up the value of the stock.

But the resulting final value

of the stock will not be as high as it would have been if the stock had not lost value previously. Consider this simplified example: Initially (time t), market participants determine that the stock of firm F is worth $80 a share. (That is, the discounted value of the future cash flows divided by the number of outstanding shares equals $80.) The firm engages in some action A at time t1, and market participants conclude the action will decrease future cash flows by 10%. When they recalculate share price based on these lower future cash flows, they find that F should only sell for $72, that is, 80 (80 x 10%) = 72 per share. (A stable discount rate is assumed throughout this example.) If a rough consensus for F is that it is overpriced, then drops to around $72. (Abnormal demand for F declines, and its price negative returns will be recorded during this drop.) Some time later; at time t2, F engages in some action B. Market participants believe this action will increase F's future cash flows by 15%. The participants recalculate share price and find that firm F should sell for $82.80, that is, 72 (72 x 15%) = 82.80 per share. We would now expect to see positive abnormal returns on F as its stock climbs to around $82.80. Firm F's shares would have been worth $92, that is, 80 + (80 x 15%) = 92. The point, then, is that if F had not committed action A at t1 then at t2, firm F's stock will be worth less than it would have been if F had not taken the action A at t1.

# METHODOLOGY

Because this article is not an event study but rather a meta-analysis of the article. First, there is an explanation of how the articles meta-analyzed in this article were selected, and then there is a description of which data were used from them: Finally, there is a review of the actual statistical tests that were applied to the data. An explanation of event study methodology appears in the Appendix:

# Selection of Studies

The following two subsections are concerned, respectively, with two issues: (a) the method used for finding event studies for possible inclusion in this meta-analysis sample and (b) the definition of a CSR event and how it was used to establish inclusion/exclusion criteria for the sample.

Downloaded from bas.sagepub.com by guest on December 3, 2014

# Frooman META-ANALYSIS

The 27 studies ultimately selected and meta-analyzed in this article are summarized in Table 1.

Search procedure. Searches for event studies were conducted using electronic databases, including ABLINFORM, INFOTRAC, LEXIS, and PERI. An extensive manual search, making use of the reference lists of each event study, was also done to find additional event studies. Because there may be a bias among journal editors to print studies producing significant results, a special effort during the manual search phase was devoted toward finding yet-unpublished studies or studies appearing in conference proceedings. (Only a few of these studies, though, ultimately ended up passing the inclusion/exclusion criteria.) Each event study found during the search procedure was considered for inclusion in this article's meta-analysis, based on whether illegal behavior was involved and based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria generated from the definition of a CSR event; as given below.

# Definition of a CSR event

Because this article uses the results of event studies as its data, it defines CSR in terms of "events." The definition is given below. Within that definition can be found inclusion/exclusion criteria for deciding which event studies ought to be meta-analyzed here. The definition of a CSR event that this study uses is based on similar ones found in the business ethics literature defining moral issues and actions. A CSR event is:

- An action by a firm, which the firm chooses to take, that substantially affects an identifiable social stakeholder's welfare.

In the paragraphs that follow, this definition will be unpacked for meaning: It has five components, and each will be explained. It will also be shown how in each case the five parts of the definition form, in essence, the criteria for determining whether a study's event is a CSR event and therefore whether the study ought to be included in or excluded from this meta-analysis.

# An action by a firm

The first phrase in the definition indicates that CSR events must stem from actors that are firms and not governmental units. The purpose of this part of the definition is to put this meta-analysis squarely into the realm of corporate social responsibility and out of the public policy realm. In other words, the focus of this meta-analysis is on the market's response to the actions of corporations, not the actions of governmental units.

governmental agencies  Thus, an event study that examines the market's reaction to the government imposing new tax laws (e.g., Umlauf; 1993) is not of interest; but an event study that examines the market's reaction to firms choosing to break tax laws is of interest (e.g., Davidson and Worrell, 1988). In the former case, the government is the actor; and the

# Frooman META-ANALYSIS

market is responding to a public policy action; in the latter case, corporations are the actors, and the market is responding to a socially irresponsible action: Furthermore, it should be noted that when a firm has broken the law, the following sequence of actions will have occurred: the action by the firm, the reaction by the regulator; and the report by the press. It is clear that nominally, the action the market responds to is either the reaction by the regulator or the report by the press. However, the underlying action this meta-analysis, such as the one on firms breaking tax laws, involves events in which the first cause is a firm's action, even though a regulator's reaction may be involved at some other point in the causal chain.

Which the firm chooses to take. The second phrase in the definition of a CSR event indicates that the actor must act out of choice, that is, with both freedom of will and willful purpose. In other words, for an actor to be a moral agent; there must be volition (Jones, 1991; Velasquez, 1992) and intention (French; 1986; Mackie, 1977). As a result, an event study that used airplane crashes (Bruning and Kuzma, 1989) as its event was not included in this meta-analysis because, as these authors observed, airplane crashes are frequently the result of bad weather or pilot error; In such cases choice is not involved. On the other hand, a study that examined FAA airline safety violations involving fines (Block, 1991) was included in this meta-analysis. The assumption here is that safety regulations are knowable and achievable by airline companies, and safety violations of some level involve an explicit or implicit decision on the part of management to not give safety observance the priority—that is, the energy, time, and money—it needs.

That substantially affects. Although substantial effect is rightfully part of the CSR event definition; it did not turn out to be a useful criterion for accepting or rejecting event studies for this meta-analysis. Basically, all studies found during the search procedure met this requirement—no researchers of event study examined actions that had insubstantial effects. The reasons for this seem obvious: First, such actions would be uninteresting to study, and second, if they were not of substantial effect they would not be newsworthy, and so there would be no data available on them.

An identifiable social stakeholder is. By identifiable, this part of the CSR event definition states that if the set of people being harmed by an action is actually an empty set, then no harm is being done. This notion.

that someone must be harmed for harm to have occurred can be located in the works of many philosophers (see, e.g-, Hobbes's [1651/1994] discussion of the justice of action versus the justice of manners and Mill's [1863/1992] discussions of justice and its 'ingredients'). By social stakeholder, I mean to draw the distinction between social and economic groups that the very phrase corporate social responsibility draws. In other words, I do not mean studying whether a firm is being economically responsible that is, generating wealth for its shareholders and creditors, for instance. Rather; I wish to direct attention at social stakeholders, such as communities, consumers, employees, and the environment.

For example, the investment advisory service, Value Line, ranks firms for timeliness based on predicted short-term price performance. An event study that investigated the market's response to Value Line's timeliness ratings (Affleck-Graves and Mendenhall, 1992) sought to determine how investors were being affected by the ratings. This was not of interest to this study because a social stakeholder's welfare did not seem to be at stake. However; an event study that examines the market's response to pollution ratings issued by the Council on Economic Priorities (Shane and Spicer; 1983) is of interest to this meta-analysis. It was included in this study because the many diverse stakeholders of a firm certainly include environmental activist groups (Freeman, 1984) whose welfare could be identified as being affected by firms' pollution performance. Furthermore, many would identify the natural environment itself as a stakeholder whose welfare would be directly affected by a firm's pollution performance.

# Welfare

The final component of the CSR event definition has to do with people's welfare being affected. As James Rest (1986) has noted, ultimately for a situation or an event to be a moral issue, actions involved ethicists would argue that whether someone's welfare is being affected must have consequences affecting someone's welfare. Indeed, business lies at the very core of ethics and social responsibility (e.g, Hosmer; 1994). Therefore, a study that examined the market reaction to the "purely cosmetic change" of a company splitting its stock (Lamoureux and Poon; 1987: 1347) was not of interest to this meta-analysis. However; a study that examined the market's reaction to a company recalling products that is, defective or dangerous for consumers (Jarrell and Peltzman, 1985) was included in this meta-analysis. Thirty event studies were found to either fit the above definition or involve illegal behavior.

# Frooman META-ANALYSIS

irresponsible and illegal behavior (actions where welfare is affected negatively), two studies (Meznar; Nigh, ad Kwok, 1994; Patten, 1990) from South Africa (ostensibly socially responsible behavior) were not included. Another study (Rubin; Murphy, and Jarrell, 1988) was excluded because it failed to provide a piece of critical data needed for this meta-analysis (i.e., the value of the t statistic from their hypothesis test). This left 27 event studies, with a total of 2,161 incidents of socially irresponsible or illegal behavior to be meta-analyzed. These 27 studies are grouped by their events in Table 2, which shows how each study fits the inclusionary/exclusionary requirements.

Finally, it should also be noted that this meta-analysis excluded from its sample those event studies using monthly return data (typically written in the 1970s and early 1980s). As Brown and Warner (1985) showed, such coarse analyses were not very dependable because too much noise could be picked up in an event month besides the effect of an event itself:

# Data Analyzed

Most meta-analyses make use of correlation coefficients (e.g., Cohen, 1993; Damanpour; 1991; Williams and Livingstone, 1994). Event studies do not; however; produce correlation coefficients. This makes the methodology of this article different from most other meta-analyses. Event studies produce two numbers of interest: test statistic values and size-of-return data. However, as will be explained, size-of-return data cannot be used. Indeed, anyone meta-analyzing event studies will be forced to perform the meta-analysis on test statistic values. The following two subsections explain why the test statistic values are used and why the return sizes reported in the event studies cannot be used. The data used in the meta-analysis are presented in Table 3.

# Why test statistic values can be used

Every event study employs hypothesis tests to see if abnormal returns around the event day are significant: Such hypothesis testing makes use of either the student's t distribution or the standard normal (z) distribution. Of the 27 events included in this meta-analysis, 15 reported t-statistic values, 9 reported z-statistic values, and 3 studies reported p values. The z's were directly changed into t's on the assumption that as sample size increases, the student's t distribution approaches the normal distribution (Marascuilo and Serlin; 1988). This was done for those studies in the meta-analysis.

Note. Number of events in meta-analysis: N = 27. Total number of incidents of socially irresponsible behavior: n = 2,161.

Table 3 numbered 3,4,16,19,20,22,24,26, and 27. Because Studies 16, 22, 24, and 26 all had sample sizes above 100, this was a reasonable change to have made. The conversion of zS into ts for Studies 3 and 19 was a bit more tenuous because these studies had sample sizes of 49 and 32, respectively. And because the conversion for Studies 4, 20, and 27 (with sample sizes of 17, 10, and 5) was even more questionable, the statistical tests were run with a sample of 18 (all the studies using t statistics originally) and with a sample of 22 (the 18 studies that used ts plus the 4 studies that had used zs but had samples of over 100). The results of these runs were almost identical to the results of the full sample of 27 and are reported in the Results section below:

Three of the studies (5,15,23) reported p values, but not ts O zs. The pS were converted into ts by using a t table and the appropriate degrees of freedom: Studies 15 and 23 did not give exact p values and instead merely indicated that the data were significant at a Type I error rate of less than .05 and .01, respectively. For these two studies, t values were taken off the student's t table by assuming the pS were exactly .05 and .01.

In short, ts could be obtained for each study, and these ts became the metric on which all the statistical analyses were based, as will be explained in the Analysis section below.

# Why size-of-return data cannot be used

Besides producing test statistics, event studies also produce size-of-return data. Davidson and Worrell (1992), for example, showed that during the 3 days surrounding their event (nonautomobile recalls), firms lost on average .0238 of their value: In other words, the average abnormal size-of-return was a negative 2.39.

Although intuitively it might seem reasonable to base the meta-analysis on such size-of-return data, such an analysis cannot be done for two reasons. First, about one third of event studies only compute average abnormal returns (AARs), another third compute only cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs), and about a third compute both. Therefore, meta-analyzing size-of-return data would clearly lead to complications because AARs and CAARs are different metrics for measuring returns.

Second, in meta-analyzing size-of-return data one would need to standardize the returns by their standard deviations (Rosenthal, 1994). Unfortunately, almost no event studies report these standard deviations. For these reasons, then, the meta-analysis had to be performed on the test statistics.

In addition, because of these problems with size-of-return data, this study did not use the replication method of meta-analysis. The replication method was used by the only other known meta-analysis of event studies (Datta, Pinches, and Narayanan, 1992). In that meta-analysis, the authors used a regression model with size-of-return data as their dependent variable. However, as just noted, because the size-of-return data collected for this meta-analysis come in two different metrics, the possibility of them being used as a variable in this study is precluded. The method of meta-analysis that this article does use is explained below.

# Analysis

This article makes use of a direct weighted linear combination of estimators method of meta-analysis, developed by Hedges and Olkin (1985). They developed a testing procedure for a fixed-effects categorical data.

model, such as the one this study fits. The test procedure employs Hedges's g, a commonly used effect size estimator; that makes use of t statistics and sample sizes the only two pieces of data this study could make use of. (Throughout this article, an n will represent the sample sizes of the event studies meta-analyzed. It will range from 5 to 535, as Table 3 indicates. An N will represent the sample size of the meta-analysis itself; typically, N=27. Hedges's g has a chi-squared distribution and is defined by the following formula (Rosenthal, 1994: 238):

g = 2tVn

Studies of Hedges's g, however; have shown it to have a small sample bias, and because this meta-analysis has several studies with very small sample sizes, the estimator d was used to correct for the bias (Hedges and Olkin, 1985: 81):

d = 1 - An - 9 g3

The variance of the estimator d is given by the formula:

var(d) = n -1n 2n

which is the two-sample variance formula modified because the event studies meta-analyzed here are one-sample studies. The two-sample formula is var(d) = [(n' + nTntn] + d/2n" 2n7, where n' is the sample size of the experimental group, and nf is the sample size of the control group. Taking n' + nf = n, the single-sample formula is obtained by setting nf = 1, the smallest positive integer for n' possible, because setting nf = 0 in the two-sample formula will produce an undefined result (Rosenthal, 1994: 238).

It should be mentioned here that this meta-analysis makes no attempt to weight the studies on quality. There are two reasons for this. First; weighting schemes that involve weighting for anything other than sample size (accomplished in this meta-analysis by Hedges's g and they should be applied with caution and viewed as are not recommended: primarily exploratory in nature" (Shadish and Haddock; 1994: 264).

Second; because event study methodology was standardized by the early to mid-1980s, it can be argued that all the studies meta-analyzed here are roughly equivalent in quality: Three procedures were followed for analyzing the data: a test for homogeneity, a test for significance, and a computation of effect size.

# Frooman META-ANALYSIS

Perform these procedures, Hedges and Olkin (1985: 163) give computational formulas, intended to facilitate computer programming, involving the ds and their variances. (Essentially, the sums of the reciprocals of the variances are used to weight the effect sizes.) The components of these sections are the following:

- TW = total of weights (reciprocals of the variances) X[Ivar(d)]
- TWD = total of weighted ds = Z[dlvar(d)]
- TWDS = total of weighted d squares = E[dIvar(d)]

# Test for homogeneity

If the underlying population of effect sizes is not the same across all the studies, then any attempt to group the effect sizes and analyze them will be questionable. A test for homogeneity is needed to determine if indeed the effect sizes could be coming from the same population. Only if the null hypothesis that the data are homogeneous is retained is it possible to proceed to a test for significance and to the calculation of a single estimate of effect magnitude. The general procedure to be used for a fixed-effects model for which observed effect sizes are being combined from a series of independent studies is explained succinctly in Shadish and Haddock (1994: 265-68). The specific procedure used in this meta-analysis is described in much more detail in Hedges and Olkin (1985: 147-65).

# The test statistic (TS) for homogeneity

Recommended by Hedges and Olkin (1985) is chi-square distributed, with degrees of freedom equal to N - 1. The test statistic and procedure are based on a total weighted sum of squares method (with effect sizes being weighted by the reciprocals of their variances), given by Hedges and Olkin as:

(TS) = E_d var(d) / (var(d) 2 - 1 var(d))

OT, in its computational form; as:

(TS) = TWDS - (TWD)² / TW

# Test for significance

The null hypothesis for this test is that the population effect size, D, is zero. The test for significance is performed on the weighted grand mean or the weighted average effect size over.

studies. The weighted grand mean, @dlva(dV[EIvar(d)J, is standardized by its standard error of estimate [ElIvar(d)]-I, This gives the following formula (Hedges and Olkin; 1985: 152):

(TS)z =X- varld) Z_1d  var(d)

Or; in its computational form, as

(TS)z  = TWDX (TW)-h,.

The large sample distribution of this statistic is standard normally distributed.

# Estimate of effect size

The best estimator of effect size is the weighted grand mean, [Edlvar(dJ[ELvar(d)]. It is the best estimator in the sense that it has the smallest variance of linearly weighted estimates and is "also precise in a larger class of estimators of effect size that includes those that are not weighted linear combinations of the d" (Hedges ad Olkin; 1985: 114,153). The formula for the estimator is the following:

D=      varld)

Or, in its computational form, as

D= TWDTW

# RESULTS

The results of the test for homogeneity, test for significance, and the estimate of effect size are all summarized in Table 4. In addition to the analysis of the full 27 studies and the four other samples mentioned above, a sample containing only those event studies reflecting socially irresponsible behavior and a sample containing only those event studies reflecting illegal behavior were also analyzed. The following subsections interpret the homogeneity, significance, and effect size results for all seven of these samples.

# Test for Homogeneity

The homogeneity test for the full sample of 27 event studies resulted in a test statistic value of (TS)2 = 16.322. The critical value for acceptance rejection of the null hypothesis for df = 26, and a Type I error rate of .05 is 38.9. This means that the null hypothesis of the data being homogeneous is retained, indicating that the event studies do indeed share a common population effect size. Homogeneity allows this meta-analysis to proceed to a test for significance and to an estimate of effect size. Homogeneity tests on the other samples - the sample of studies that reported AARs, the sample of studies that reported only CAARs, the sample of studies that based significance on t distributions, the sample of studies that used z distributions or used z distributions but had large samples, the sample of illegal actions, and the sample of irresponsible actions - also produced test statistics indicating homogeneity (see Table 4).

# Test for Significance

For the full sample of 27 event studies, the value of the test statistic for the significance test; (TS)z = -4.648 (p < .0001), makes it clear that the null hypothesis that the population effect size is zero can be rejected (at p < .05). The significance tests on the other six samples, as reported in Table 4, also permit us to reject the null hypothesis.

# Estimate of Effect Size

The full sample of 27 event studies shows an effect size estimate of D = -0.932, or approximately one full (negative) standard deviation difference between the distributions of the normal and abnormal returns. So, on average, abnormal returns were a full standard deviation below expected normal (i.e., zero) returns. Or, in other words, one could think of the AARs and CAARs as typically having a distribution centered around zero, but on and around the event day one could think of the distribution of those AARs and CAARs as having a distribution shifted a full standard deviation to the left of zero - that is, indicating significantly negative abnormal returns. In a sense, then, socially irresponsible and illicit behavior decreases abnormal returns by a full standard deviation. The 95% confidence interval for the effect size is given by the following formula (Hedges and Olkin; 1985: 8):

# Frooman META-ANALYSIS

=(Zonz Xod) < D<d+ (Zon Oa), where Zon is the two-tailed critical value of the standard normal distribution. In this meta-analysis, then; the confidence interval of the effect size estimator is _. 93 _ (1.96)(.20) < D< -.93 + (1.96)(.20), which simplifies to -1.32<D< -.54. This means quite simply that we can be 95% confident that the difference between the distribution of the abnormal returns and the normal returns is at least ~. 54 standard deviation units and may be as much as -1.32 standard deviation units. Without any clear standards existing in the event study methodology with which to evaluate an effect size of approximately -1 standard deviation unit, one is forced to fall back on Cohen and Cohen's (1983 rule of thumb for interpreting effect sizes: d = .2 (small effect), d = .5 (medium effect), and d = .8 (large effect). Effect sizes from _.93 to -1.32 are quite substantial, then, and even an effect size as small as _.54 (the upper limit of the confidence interval) still shows that socially irresponsible and illicit behavior can have a moderate effect on abnormal returns.

Ds were also calculated under all the various assumptions indicated in Table 4 and ranged from D = -683 (for the sample of studies using irresponsible behavior as their events) to D = -1.201 (for the sample of studies using CAARs). The average D for these seven meta-analysis samples reported in Table 4 is -.912, which reflects as large an effect as the full sample of 27 event studies.

# DISCUSSION

From the test for significance it is clear that abnormal returns are significant and negative across the studies. These event studies are showing that shareholder wealth is decreased when firms act in a socially irresponsible or illegal manner; This supports Proposition 3, suggesting that acting in a socially responsible and law-abiding manner can be seen as a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for increasing shareholder wealth, all other things equal. This would suggest, then, that the maxim (Proposition 1) of enlightened self-interest may indeed serve the shareholder's interests. In addition, the effect size is substantial ~approximately a full standard deviation unit; This means that the distribution of abnormal returns, which is expected to be centered around zero (i.e., generally no abnormal returns).

are expected), is shifted dramatically to the negative side of zero. A shift to the left in the distribution of abnormal returns by a full standard deviation indicates a strong negative effect on shareholder wealth.

For theorists, these results lend support to the normative ethical position of enlightened self-interest. It supplies those doing research in business ethics and corporate social responsibility with empirical results showing that social responsibility does indeed have a role to play in business. These results also present a self-interested reason to practitioners to be socially responsible and law abiding: Such a self-interested reason seems needed due to the simple fact that no other reason has worked or may ever work. Christopher Stone (1975), for instance, pointed out in a chapter titled Why the Law Can't Do It that the legal system is best at enforcing minimum behavior—in a sense, preventing people from being bad—but Mancur Olson (1965) showed why calls for socially responsible cooperation may fail due to the free rider problem. In short; maybe a self-interested, economic argument is the only argument that may work. Thomas Schelling (1978) has observed that self-interest has succeeded at motivating people to be good at times when the law, social contracting, the golden rule, and other moral arguments have all failed. The argument supported here—that socially responsible and law-abiding behavior is a necessary condition for increasing shareholder wealth—is one argument that can be directed at economically self-interested firms.

To continue building the case in favor of socially responsible behavior; additional work still needs to be done by researchers regarding event studies. The rest of this section poses three questions to guide such research:

One question future research ought to address is whether the market rewards socially responsible and law-abiding behavior. This article meta-analyzed studies looking only at whether shareholder wealth was affected by firms engaging in socially irresponsible and illegal behavior: This was done because this was essentially the data that were available. (The 27 studies of irresponsible and illicit behavior constitute a reasonable sample size for meta-analysis.) Only 3 studies have examined the effects on shareholder wealth of socially responsible behavior; and 3 studies do not represent a large enough sample for meta-analysis. Of the 3 studies, Shane and Spicer (1983) found that there were significantly negative abnormal returns for companies that were given bad pollution ratings and that there were significantly positive abnormal returns for companies receiving good pollution ratings.

on the shareholder wealth of firms withdrawing from South Africa (Meznar et al, 1994) or adopting the Sullivan Principles (Patten; 1990), found no significant effects. Both studies noted that using actions toward South Africa as an event presented this complication: Arguments were made in the CSR literature demonstrating that remaining in South Africa was socially responsible. So was socially irresponsible, but other arguments in the CSR literature although it is difficult to draw any conclusions from these three studies as a group; their existence indicates that it is at least possible to conduct event studies focused on socially responsible events. I believe that more such event studies are called for; and at some future date a meta-analysis of socially responsible behavior and its effects on shareholder wealth would be warranted.

The second question that future research needs to concern itself with is how the magnitude of the abnormal returns relates to the size of any costs absorbed by the firms. The theoretical literature suggests that the size of the abnormal returns ought to be tied closely to the size of the costs a company must pay to rectify a socially irresponsible act. Only eight of the event studies, however, tried to find a correlation between the size of the abnormal returns and the magnitude of remedial costs (e.g., court costs, damages, lost goodwill) firms incur. Five of these eight studies (Studies 9, 11, 14, 21, and 24 in Table 1) showed no systematic relationship between remedial costs and abnormal returns. One study (27), however, did find that the size of the abnormal returns correlated to the added costs of more stringent regulations that were passed in response to the irresponsible behavior: Two studies (5, 22) tested whether the magnitude of the penalty imposed by the market was related to the magnitude of the firms' irresponsible behavior and found that indeed the most irresponsible companies were penalized the most.

Clearly this is not enough evidence to conclude anything, and so correlating the size of the market penalty in dollar-per-share terms to the abnormal returns is something for all future CSR event studies to consider doing. A final question researchers still need to address is this: The market does appear to be reacting to the socially irresponsible and illicit behavior of firms in such a way that shareholder wealth decreases. If we were to think of this as a penalty absorbed by shareholders, we might ask whether the market is imposing the penalty in response to the socially irresponsible and illegal behavior of the firms (in which case the market's action would be ethical in nature), or whether it is imposing the penalty in response to the bad news and its potential to decrease expected future income streams (in which case the market's action would be economic in nature).

Whichever the answer turns out to be, though whether ethical or economic we can say that based on this meta-analysis, the shareholder wealth of firms engaging in socially irresponsible or illicit behavior is decreasing: In other words, even if we do not know why the shareholders are losing wealth, this meta-analysis shows that they are. And, as a result, we can still say that Proposition 3 holds true, that socially responsible and lawful behavior is necessary, though not sufficient; for shareholder wealth to be increased.

So despite the need for further research; this meta-analysis does indicate that socially responsible and illicit behavior is necessary (though not sufficient) to increase shareholder wealth, all other things equal. That the shareholder wealth of those firms engaging in irresponsible or illegal behavior does decrease finally gives economically self-interested firms a self-interested motive for being socially responsible and law abiding:

# APPENDIX

# Event Study Methodology

Event studies focus on a particular type of event—product recalls, for example—and try to determine whether the stock market responds to the news of the event; In other words, does anything "abnormal" happen to a company's stock when the company makes a recall? The theory underlying event studies is the efficient markets hypothesis, which argues that modern financial markets are information efficient. The markets can anticipate and correctly interpret news about a security and adjust the price of the security very quickly to reflect that news (Fama et al., 1969). Although most researchers agree now that financial markets are not "information perfect" in their performance, they do work with a high degree of efficiency and accuracy (Holthausen, Leftwich, and Mayers, 1990). The methodology for event studies became standardized by the mid-1980s, before most of the CSR event studies meta-analyzed here had even been done. (This standardization served to facilitate this meta-analysis because it ensured that the results of the studies are roughly comparable, that is, homogeneous.)

This article includes only a brief summary of event study methodology that centers on the use of two key concepts: abnormal returns and average abnormal returns.

# Abnormal Returns (ARs)

Abnormal returns accrue when a stock outperforms the market. So when a stock earns significantly greater positive or negative returns than other stocks in the market, it is considered to have abnormal returns.

# Frooman MTA-ANALYSIS 245

According to the market model and its equation for calculating abnormal returns, its risk class, it is earning abnormal returns. Abnormal returns can be computed (Fama et al, 1969). An abnormal return can be defined as:

Abnormal Return = Actual Return - Expected Return,

Or, in mathematical terms, as:

ARit = Rit - E(Ri),

where ARit = the abnormal return for security i in time period t, Rit = the actual return for security i in time period t, and E(Ri) = the expected return for security i in time period t.

It should be noted here that E(ARi) = 0; that is, on average we expect a firm's abnormal returns to be zero - we expect nothing abnormal to be happening to a firm's returns (unless of course, as will be explained, something abnormal is happening to the firm). The expected return for individual stock i can be determined first by regressing its returns against the return of a market portfolio (e.g., the S&P 500) and calculating the slope (beta) and vertical intercept (αi) of that function. Then, given the return of the market portfolio on any given day (Rmt), the expected return for a stock can be calculated according to the market model:

E(i) = αi + βiRmt

where βi = the beta for security i (a constant), and Rmt = the actual return for the market portfolio (e.g., S&P 500) in time period t.

# Average Abnormal Returns (AARs)

The key to event study methodology is that it examines not just one action but rather many actions simultaneously. Put another way, an event study on automobile recalls would not look at only one recall made by Chrysler Corporation in August 1986, for instance, but rather at all recalls made by Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors between 1980 and 1989, for example. Thus, an average abnormal return could be calculated as:

AARt = (ΣARi) / n,

where AAR = the average abnormal return in time period t for all the events involved, and n = the number of events in the study. Standard hypothesis testing is used on the average abnormal returns for each day in the event window. If the market reacts specially to events, then the average abnormal return will be significantly different from zero. Finally, it should be noted here that 11 studies used a variation of this standard methodology and ended up computing cumulative average abnormal returns (CAARs): This methodology is explained in detail in Dodd and Warner (1983).

# NOTES

1. The logic of my argument is as follows:

First the statements:

1. A: Firms acted in a socially responsible and lawful manner:
2. B: Shareholder wealth is increased.

Enlightened self-interest theorists argue:

1. A 5 B (i.e., if firms acted in a socially responsible and lawful manner; then shareholder wealth is increased.)

We have no data to substantiate (3) but argue that we can show A is a necessary condition for B, that is:

1. B > A (i.e., if shareholder wealth is increased, then firms acted in a socially responsible and lawful manner.)

The contrapositive of (4) that is, a logical equivalent of (4) is:

1. ~A → ~B (i.e., if firms did not act in a socially responsible and lawful manner; then shareholder wealth is not increased)

We focus our attention on this proposition because of the nature of the data, which are data on the effects of socially irresponsible behavior on shareholder wealth.

2. Event studies presume that the market finds out about the irresponsible behavior; it is possible that some firms engaging in illegal or irresponsible behavior succeed in concealing that behavior and would thus never become the subject of an event study.

# Abstract

This paper provides an empirical investigation of the effect of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme on German stock returns. We find that, during the first few years of the scheme, firms that received free carbon emission allowances on average significantly outperformed firms that did not. This suggests the presence of a large and statistically significant “carbon premium,” which is mainly explained by the higher cash flows due to the free allocation of carbon emission allowances. A carbon risk factor can also explain part of the cross-sectional variation of stock returns as firms with high carbon emissions have higher exposure to carbon risk and exhibit higher expected returns.

# 1 Introduction

Since the introduction of the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), carbon emissions in Europe are capped, traded and priced. The EU ETS has created a new financial market for trading carbon emission allowances that give firms the right to emit carbon dioxide. During the initial two phases of the scheme, beginning in 2005 and ending in 2012, carbon emission allowances were granted to European firms predominantly free of charge. Firms that chose to pollute more than the allowances they received had to purchase extra allowances in the open market from firms that used less allowances than they received. This has led to the emergence of the largest multinational carbon market in the world (World Bank, 2014).

This paper is at the cross-section of environmental economics and finance. As the emergence of the European carbon market is a recent phenomenon, there is little work on how environmental regulation on carbon emissions can affect the financial performance of firms. This paper fills this gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive empirical investigation of the effect of the EU ETS on stock returns. Our empirical analysis uses data on monthly stock returns from Germany as well as manually collected data on the number of carbon emission allowances received by each firm in the sample. We focus on Germany because it is by far the largest national market for carbon emissions and accounts for a quarter of Europe’s total carbon emissions. For robustness, we also examine data from the UK.

To be more specific, the main question of our empirical analysis is the following: did the free allocation of carbon emission allowances during the initial two phases of the EU ETS generate a “carbon premium” in stock returns? We address this question empirically by designing three carbon portfolios: the “dirty”, “medium” and “clean” portfolios. The dirty portfolio is a portfolio of firms that received a high number of free carbon emission allowances, the medium portfolio comprises firms that received a lower number of free allowances, and the clean portfolio includes all firms in the sample that did not receive any allowances. We then define the carbon premium as the abnormal excess return (alpha) of the “dirty-minus-clean” portfolio, which is assessed relative to the CAPM, the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model and the Carhart (1997) four-factor model.

Our empirical analysis relies on an economic mechanism that attributes the carbon premium to two effects: the cash flow effect and the “carbon risk” effect. In terms of the cash flow effect, we show that the free allocation of carbon allowances can generate significant

proÖts to carbon emitting Örms. We use the framework of Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010) to demonstrate that a cap-and-trade system increases the marginal cost of production since the free carbon allowances constitute an opportunity cost to the Örm. Firms tend to respond to the higher marginal cost by increasing output prices, reducing production so that less carbon allowances are used up, switching to less carbon-intensive production technologies or a combination of these options. This is the primary mechanism that justiÖes the carbon premium as it implies that the free allocation of carbon allowances can lead to large windfall Örm proÖts.

There is also a secondary mechanism that explains the carbon premium based on the carbon risk e§ect. According to this e§ect, carbon emitting Örms will be subject to carbon risk due to uncertainty about the future price for carbon allowances, which in turn generates uncertainty about future cash áows. For example, a volatile price for carbon allowances will a§ect the cash áows of Örms. Furthermore, an institutional change in the EU ETS, such as a change in the law that initially gives carbon allowances for free but subsequently makes them available in auctions will also a§ect future cash áows. Finally, recent contributions by Weitzman (2009), Litterman (2013) and Pindyck (2013) suggest that carbon emitting Örms are exposed to carbon risk because they might face a higher price for carbon allowances in the future as a result of catastrophic climate change. In short, therefore, carbon risk is based on uncertainty about the future price for carbon emissions. As a result, carbon emitting Örms will require higher expected returns relative to Örms with no carbon emissions.

Our main empirical Önding is that there is a large and statistically signiÖcant carbon premium in stock returns, which can be as high as 17% per year. We show that this result holds for the sample period that ranges from November 2003 to March 2009. This sample period begins with the passing of an EU law establishing the initial two phases of the ETS that o§ered carbon allowances to Örms for free. It ends with the passing of another EU law establishing the third phase of the ETS during which carbon allowances are predominantly sold in auctions from 2013 onwards. Hence this is the period over which the market knew with certainty that carbon emitting Örms will be receiving free carbon allowances. Our evidence clearly indicates that after March 2009 the carbon premium largely disappears. The timing of the carbon premium based on German data is also conÖrmed by the UK data. Note that our main sample extends to December 2012, which is the end of the second phase of the EU ETS.

In addition to the free allocation of carbon allowances, another explanation for the large carbon premium over the relevant sample period is the effect of carbon risk on expected stock returns. We assess this effect by constructing the “dirty-minus-clean” (DMC) risk factor, which is a zero-investment portfolio defined as the expected return on a portfolio of dirty stocks minus the expected return on a portfolio of clean stocks. Then, we implement Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions to show that there is a positive price of carbon risk since dirty firms that have higher exposure to carbon risk exhibit higher expected returns. Overall, for the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009, carbon risk can explain a large part of the cross-sectional variation in stock returns. For this sample period, the significance of the carbon risk factor is robust to the inclusion of a large set of control variables. In short, therefore, a combination of the cash flow effect and the carbon risk effect can provide a basis for explaining the high carbon premium in German stock returns over the relevant period.

In assessing robustness, we find that the carbon premium tends to be higher the dirtier the portfolio, i.e., the higher the number of allowances received by firms included in the dirty portfolio. Furthermore, the carbon premium is not diminished when we condition on changes in the price for carbon allowances and changes in the price of energy indexes such as oil, natural gas, coal and electricity.

The empirical finding that the carbon premium is present for a specific time period indicates that it may have been a one-off event that lasted for as long as the law stipulated that carbon allowances will be given for free. Specifically, this period commences about one year before the beginning of Phase I and disappears about one year into Phase II. At the same time, it is worth noting that the EU ETS is arguably the most significant multinational initiative ever taken to mobilize markets to protect the environment. As such, it has a profound impact on the development and implementation of other emission trading schemes. Over the past few years, many countries or regions have followed the EU in establishing similar cap-and-trade schemes or are currently in the process of doing so. Therefore, even if the carbon premium is a one-off event in Europe, our analysis makes an important contribution to the current environmental policy debate because it informs policy-makers and investors about the design and implications of similar cap-and-trade environmental regulation implemented elsewhere.1

1 There is a number of existing, emerging and potential emissions trading schemes around the world. For example, some of the existing emissions trading schemes include Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Kazakhstan, California, several north-east and mid-atlantic US states, Quebec, several provinces of China and some cities in Japan. For more details, see World Bank (2014).

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next two sections we review the relevant literature and the institutional details of the EU ETS. Section 4 discusses the theoretical arguments suggesting a relation between carbon emissions and stock returns. In Section 5 we describe the data used in the empirical analysis. Section 6 provides a framework for measuring the carbon premium in stock returns and discusses the main empirical results. In Section 7 we present empirical evidence on the price of carbon risk. Section 8 reports our findings on robustness and Section 9 extends our analysis by providing empirical evidence on the UK. Finally, Section 10 concludes.

# 2 Literature Review

This paper is related to three distinct lines of research that focus on different aspects of the EU ETS. One line of research evaluates the effect of movements in the price for carbon allowances on the returns of different sets of European electrical power companies. For example, Oberndorfer (2009) and Veith, Werner and Zimmermann (2009) use data from Phase I (2005 to 2007), whereas Koch and Bassen (2013) extend their sample to 2010. These studies estimate the sensitivity of stock returns to changes in the price for carbon allowances, while also conditioning on other energy factors such as price changes in oil, gas, coal and electricity. Overall, this line of research establishes a positive relation between movements in the price of carbon allowances and movements in stock prices in the European power sector.

A second line of research uses an event study methodology to isolate the effect of the sharp decline in the price of carbon allowances that took place in April 2006 on the stock returns of carbon-intensive European firms. These studies include Bushnell, Chong and Mansur (2013) and Jong, Couwenberg and Woerdman (2014). They find that the drastic drop in carbon prices over a three-day window had a negative impact on the stock returns of carbon-intensive firms. This indicates that carbon regulation plays a significant role in determining the profits of dirty firms.

Finally, a third line of research is based on a simulation methodology that makes assumptions about the technology underlying coal-generated and gas-generated power. This analysis is adopted by Sijm, Neuhoff and Chen (2006) and Smale, Hartley, Hepburn, Ward and Grubb (2006), who show that the introduction of the EU ETS allows power companies to realize substantial windfall profits.

A common thread across this body of research is that the main focus is to estimate the sensitivity (i.e., the beta) of stock returns to changes in carbon prices. In contrast, our empirical analysis is primarily concerned with the extent to which the abnormal excess return (i.e., the alpha) of a portfolio of dirty firms is higher than that of a portfolio of clean firms. Compared to the literature, we also adopt a different approach based on an asset pricing methodology applied on portfolios for a large set of stocks from many different industry sectors and for a longer sample. In the end, we make a distinct contribution to the literature by quantifying the effect of carbon regulation on German stock returns and the benefits to investors of holding carbon portfolios for the period when carbon allowances were granted for free.

# 3 The EU Emissions Trading Scheme

The EU ETS is the world’s first and largest multinational cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide (CO2). It covers about half of CO2 emissions in all EU member states, 40% of total greenhouse emissions, and involves about 11,500 factory installations that together emit 2 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. For more information on the EU ETS see Ellerman, Convery and de Perthuis (2010) and World Bank (2014).

The EU ETS works as follows. First, it sets an annual cap on the overall emissions to be allowed. Second, it allocates allowances to emitters such that the sum of the allowances does not exceed the cap. The units in which allocations are measured are called the European Union Allowances (EUAs), which give polluters the right to emit one tonne of CO2. Note that the EUAs are given to individual installations (i.e., at the plant level, not the firm level). Third, the emitters choose how much to pollute. If they pollute more than the EUAs they have received, they must purchase extra EUAs from those who used less EUAs than they received, and vice versa. This system creates incentives to polluters to reduce emissions (e.g., through technological innovations) so they can sell the surplus EUAs for profit.

As seen in the timeline presented in Table 1, the EU ETS has been implemented in three separate phases. Phase I ran from January 2005 to December 2007, Phase II from January 2008 to December 2012, and Phase III currently runs from January 2013 to December 2019. For the first two phases, the EUAs were predominantly given to installations free of charge. Note that Phase I allowances could not be banked in Phase II and hence lost their value if unused. In the third phase, the majority of the EUAs are sold in auctions. Installations

receive annual allowances in March of every year which, if used, must be surrendered by the end of April of the following year. The penalty for noncompliance is e40 per EUA not surrendered in Phase I and e100 in Phase II. The end of April is also the date when externally verified emissions are made public for each EU country. The EUAs can be traded in several trading platforms, notably the European Climate Exchange (ECX) in London, the European Energy Exchange (EEX) in Leipzig, and Nord Pool in Norway.

# 4 Cash Flows, Expected Returns and the EU ETS

It is well known that changes in current stock returns reflect changes in future cash flows and changes in expected returns (e.g., Campbell and Shiller, 1988). This section discusses the effect of the EU ETS on firms' cash flows (the primary effect) and expected returns (the secondary effect).

# 4.1 The Effect on Cash Flows

We begin with a discussion of how a cap-and-trade system with a free allocation of carbon allowances can generate significant additional profits for carbon emitting firms. The first step in the mechanism is to recognize that a cap-and-trade system increases the marginal cost of production for the affected firms. The increase is equal to the market value of the EUAs required to produce one unit of output. Note that this is the case regardless of whether the EUAs are bought in the open market (an actual cost to the firm) or are received for free (an opportunity cost to the firm). In other words, for every unit of carbon allowances the firm uses, either it has to purchase this unit or it has to forego one unit from the surplus allowances it can sell.

Following Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010), we use the simple demand and supply diagram in Figure 1 to illustrate the effect of carbon allowances on the profits of a perfectly competitive industry.2 In the absence of carbon regulation, the initial equilibrium price and quantity are given by p0 and X0 respectively. When we introduce a cap-and-trade scheme for carbon emissions with a free allocation of carbon allowances, the supply curve shifts up for two reasons: (i) the higher marginal cost due to the actual or opportunity cost of the

2 The perfectly competitive firms are assumed to have constant emission rates (emissions per unit of output). See Bushnell, Chong and Mansur (2013) for an analysis of imperfectly competitive firms with emission rates that depend on the level of output. Since the main intuition remains the same for perfect and imperfect competition, we focus on the case of perfect competition.

carbon allowances required per unit of output, denoted by r; and (ii) the higher marginal cost associated with a less carbon-intensive technology, denoted by c (fuel-switching costs). In the new equilibrium, production X1 is lower and the price pC consumers pay is higher exceeding the original marginal supply cost by c + r.

In this setup, the introduction of a cap-and-trade system with a free allocation of carbon allowances can generate significant profits to carbon emitting firms. Specifically, the gain in producer surplus is represented by the shaded rectangular area A (or area pC aef), which is equal to r * X1. Note that, had the allowances been sold at auctions, area A would reflect the revenue to government. In the figure, area A appears much larger than the loss in producer surplus represented by the shaded trapezoidal area B (or area p0bdpS). If the difference of area A minus area B is positive, we can conclude that the free allocation of carbon allowances provides the firm with higher profits in the presence of carbon regulation. The size of areas A and B depends on the extent to which firms can shift to consumers the increase in marginal cost through higher output prices.

In summary, Figure 1 provides a simple but effective framework for showing the two direct effects on firm profits of the cap-and-trade scheme for carbon emissions. First, firms face higher marginal costs, which to a large extent are passed through to consumers through higher output prices, thus increasing firm revenue. Second, output falls and, since carbon allowances are allocated freely, the allowances not used in production can be sold for a profit. The combination of the two direct effects provides a mechanism that leads to substantial additional profits for carbon emitting firms.3

It is important to note that in the early stages of the EU ETS, there was considerable uncertainty regarding several aspects of its implementation. For example, as shown in the timeline in Table 1, the number of allowances given to each firm was made public in April 2006, which is more than two years after the EU ETS became law in November 2003. The price of the EUAs fluctuated considerably over time. There were other unknowns as well: the degree to which the opportunity cost of the allowances was incorporated into prices and the degree to which firms invested in alternative less carbon-intensive technologies. These examples indicate that, although the actual effect of the ETS on firm cash flows is expected to be positive, its exact magnitude was initially uncertain as information gradually became available.

3 The graphical illustration of Figure 1 presents a static analysis. Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010) also propose an intertemporal general equilibrium model that delivers similar results. For related theoretical studies of the effect of the EU ETS on firm profits see Sijm, Neuhoff and Chen (2006), Smale, Hartley, Hepburn, Ward and Grubb (2006), and Demailly and Quirion (2009).

available over time. This is consistent with the insights of Pastor and Veronesi (2012), who study the effect of uncertainty about government policy on stock prices and identify impact uncertainty as the uncertainty about the impact of a new government policy on firms' profitability.

# 4.2 The Effect on Expected Returns

In addition to the primary effect of the free allocation of carbon allowances, there is a secondary effect based on "carbon risk". In particular, firms that require carbon allowances are subject to carbon risk due to uncertainty about the future price for the allowances, which also generates uncertainty about future cash flows. For example, the EUA price has fluctuated considerably over time and will likely continue to remain volatile in the future. This can have an effect on future cash flows.

Furthermore, an institutional change in the EU ETS, such as a change in the law that initially gives carbon allowances for free but subsequently makes them available in auctions has a profound effect on the market's expectation of future cash flows.

Finally, recent contributions by Weitzman (2009), Litterman (2013) and Pindyck (2013) suggest that carbon emitting firms are exposed to carbon risk because they might face a higher price for carbon allowances in the future as a result of catastrophic climate change. This is because the price of carbon allowances reflects the present value of damages from emitting one tonne of CO2, which is often referred to as the social cost of carbon.4 According to Litterman (2013), carbon risk is non-diversifiable and hence will command a risk premium determined by societal risk aversion. It is true that assessing the social cost of carbon is difficult because there is great uncertainty today about: the size of future economic damages related to climate change; the probability with which they may occur; the timing of when they may occur; and the discount rate to be used in computing their present value. Given this uncertainty, as long as we cannot rule out that a climate-related economic catastrophe.

4 For example, Pindyck (2013) argues that if there is a reasonable possibility that a catastrophic climate change might occur, then the social cost of carbon in the US could reach a price of $200. This is about ten times higher than the EUA price in our sample period.

may happen in the future, dirty Örms will be subject to carbon risk. In short, therefore, carbon risk in our context reáects the uncertainty about the future price for carbon allowances. As carbon emitting Örms are exposed to carbon risk, they will require higher expected returns relative to Örms with no carbon emissions. This argument informs our second testing hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 2 (H2)

Other things being equal, carbon emitting Örms are exposed to carbon risk and hence require higher expected returns relative to Örms with no carbon emissions. This is a further reason why there is a carbon premium in stock returns.

# 5 Data on Carbon Emissions and Stock Returns

# 5.1 Sample Period

The sample period used in our analysis ranges from November 2003 to December 2012. This period begins with the passing of an EU law establishing the initial two phases of the EU ETS. It ends with the expiration of Phase II and, therefore, covers only the period during which carbon allowances were given to Örms for free. Note that this sample period commences 14 months before the beginning of Phase I, which runs from January 2005 to December 2007, and covers the full span of Phase II, which runs from January 2008 to December 2012.

Throughout our analysis, we also consider a shorter sample period, which also begins in November 2003 but ends earlier in March 2009. The end date of the shorter period coincides with the passing of an EU law establishing Phase III of the EU ETS beginning in 2013 during which carbon allowances are mainly sold in auctions. Hence the shorter period captures the period over which the law stipulated the free allocation of carbon allowances. Hence during this period there was no uncertainty to Örms about whether they would receive free allowances or not. A detailed timeline of events is shown in Table 1.

# 5.2 Stock Returns

Our empirical analysis uses an extensive data set of monthly stock returns from Germany, which is the largest economy in the EU and is responsible for one quarter of EU carbon emissions. We focus on the 80 Örms currently trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which are included in the two main German stock indexes: the DAX (30 large caps) and

5 The Örst EU law was passed on October 13, 2003: Directive 2003/87/EC. The second EU law was passed on April 23, 2009: Directive 2009/29/EC.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497

the MDAX (50 mid caps). Together the DAX and MDAX companies comprise more than 95% of the German stock market capitalization, which is indicative of the high degree of concentration in the German economy.

Our main analysis excludes 15 of the 80 Örms for which we do not have monthly return observations for the full sample period. Hence we employ data for the remaining 65 Örms. In the robustness section, we show that using the full cross-section of 80 Örms does not a§ect our main Öndings. Monthly stock returns are calculated as rj;t+1 = ln(Pj;t+1) - ln(Pj;t), where Pj;t is the total return index (that accounts for dividend reinvestment) of stock j at time t obtained from Datastream. The market value of equity (ME) is also taken from Datastream.

The return to the market portfolio is proxied by the DAX stock index return taken from Datastream. Our proxy for the monthly risk-free rate is the one-month money market rate reported by Deutsche Bundesbank. The Fama-French (1993) size and value factors and the Carhart (1997) momentum factor are provided by the Centre for Financial Research at the University of Cologne. These factors are especially constructed for the German economy (see, Artmann, Finter, Kempf, Koch and Theissen, 2012). Note that these factors are available until December 2012, which covers our full sample. This set of Fama-French factors for Germany has recently been studied in detail by Bruckner, Lehmann, Schmidt and Stehle (2014), who assess the factor construction and the underlying data and conclude that these factors are highly reliable. This is especially true for our sample period that begins in 2003.

# 5.3 Carbon Emission Allowances

We manually collect information on the number of carbon emission allowances given for free to each Örm using the Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL), which is a source of veriÖed carbon emission information set up by the European Commission. Note that the CITL emission allowances are allocated by the member stateís National Allocation Plan for each individual installation of each Örm. We match each installation to the Örms it belongs to and aggregate across installations for each Örm to determine the total number of free EUAs issued to each Örm. Overall, the companies included in our analysis received about one third of the total amount of EUAs allocated in Germany. This is because a considerable proportion of the allowances were granted to utilities that are partly state-owned (hence are not public) or trade infrequently outside of the main stock indexes.

# 5.4 Descriptive Statistics

Table 2 reports monthly descriptive statistics for the 65 German stocks over the two sample periods of November 2003 to March 2009 and November 2003 to December 2012. The table indicates that Örms belong to a wide range of industries effectively capturing every aspect of the German economy. Of the 65 Örms, 24 received carbon emission allowances (the “dirty” Örms), whereas 41 Örms did not (the “clean” Örms). The number of annual allowances issued to each Örm ranges from 5,000 to 109 million. 14 Örms received more than 100,000 annual allowances and eight Örms received more than one million annual allowances. In general, the number of Phase I allowances tends to be higher than that of Phase II, especially for large polluters.

The table also reports Örm size measured by the average market value of equity (ME) as well as the annualized mean return, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio for each Örm. Overall, the sample of 65 Örms represents a high proportion of the German stock market capitalization, while capturing a wide distribution of Örms across industries, size, performance and use of carbon emission allowances.

# 6 The Carbon Premium in Stock Returns

Our empirical analysis provides a framework for investigating whether Örms that received carbon emission allowances significantly outperformed Örms that did not. In particular, we are interested in whether on average “dirty” Örms exhibit abnormal excess returns relative to “clean” Örms. In other words, our main question is whether there is a carbon premium in stock returns.

# 6.1 A Portfolio Approach

We address this question by designing three carbon portfolios: the “dirty”, “medium” and “clean” portfolios. The dirty portfolio is a portfolio of Örms, which during the initial two phases of the EU ETS have received annually more than one million free EUAs. The medium portfolio is a portfolio of Örms, which for the same period have received annually more than zero but less than one million free EUAs. The clean portfolio is a portfolio of Örms, which have not received any EUAs. Throughout our analysis we also form the “dirty-minus-clean” portfolio, which is equivalent to going long on the dirty portfolio and short.

on the clean portfolio. This difference portfolio allows us to better understand the role of carbon allowances in determining financial performance. All portfolios are formed with equal weights.6 Note that the composition of the three carbon portfolios does not change over time since it is the same firms that each year satisfy the criteria for inclusion in the portfolios. Therefore, there is no portfolio rebalancing.

The first criterion for distinguishing between dirty versus clean firms on the basis of whether they have received free carbon allowances is natural. In the context of our data sample, 24 stocks received carbon allowances (belonging to the dirty and medium portfolios), whereas 41 did not (belonging to the clean portfolio). The second criterion for distinguishing between firms receiving a high number of carbon allowances (belonging to the dirty portfolio) and those receiving a low number of carbon allowances (belonging to the medium portfolio) is however ad hoc. Throughout our analysis, we draw the line between the dirty and medium portfolios at one million free EUAs. This implies that eight stocks belong to the dirty portfolio and 16 stocks to the medium portfolio. Note, however, that in the robustness section we comprehensively assess whether changing the composition of the dirty portfolio affects the results.

# 6.2 Portfolio Returns

Our first empirical finding is illustrated in Figure 2, which plots the cumulative returns of the dirty, clean and dirty-minus-clean portfolios for three sample periods. The first period is the pre-ETS period, which ranges from November 1998 to October 2003, and corresponds to the five years immediately before the ETS was passed into law. The second period ranges from November 2003 to March 2009, which is the period that begins with the passing of the law establishing the EU ETS and ends with the passing of the law that terminates the free allocation of allowances. The third period ranges from April 2009 to March 2014, which corresponds to the five years immediately after the second period.

The figure provides a stark contrast in the performance of the carbon portfolios before (upper graph), during (middle graph) and after (lower graph) the introduction of the EU ETS. In the five years before, the performance of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio revolves.

We use equally weighted portfolios because the cross-section of firms is not very large and hence equally weighted portfolios ensure that the performance of the carbon portfolios is not determined primarily by the largest firms. This is important since firm value in the German economy is highly concentrated in few firms. Note, however, that in unreported results we find that value weighted portfolios deliver qualitatively similar results.

12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497

around zero. In the second period, the cumulative return of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio increases monotonically and reaches a maximum value of about 100%. Finally, in the five years after the second period, the cumulative return of the dirty-minus-clean portfolios decreases monotonically. In short, this is preliminary evidence suggesting that firms that received carbon allowances substantially outperformed firms that did not for the period of November 2003 to March 2009, but not before or after.

# 6.3 Factor Models

Next we turn to the alpha (α) of the carbon portfolios, which is measured as the abnormal excess return relative to three standard factor models. This leads to three time-series regressions. The first regression is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which is specified as follows:

rj,t - rf,t = αj + βj (rM,t - rf,t) + εj,t; (1)

where rj,t is the monthly return of portfolio j at time t for j being one of the dirty, medium or clean portfolios, rf,t is the monthly riskless rate at time t, rM,t is the monthly return to the market portfolio at time t, and εj,t is a normal error term.

The second regression is based on the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model:

rj,t - rf,t = αj + βj1 (rM,t - rf,t) + βj2SMBt + βj3HMLt + εj,t; (2)

where SMBt is the monthly return to the “small-minus-big” size factor, and HMLt is the monthly return to the “high-minus-low” value factor. We term this the F F 3 model.

The third regression is based on the Carhart (1997) four-factor model:

rj,t - rf,t = αj + βj1 (rM,t - rf,t) + βj2SMBt + βj3HMLt + βj4MOMt + εj,t; (3)

where MOMt is the monthly return to the momentum factor. We term this the F F 4 model. Note that the SMB, HML and MOM factors are specific to the German economy (see, Artmann, Finter, Kempf, Koch and Theissen, 2012).

13

# 6.4 The Carbon Premium

We define the alpha of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio as the carbon premium in stock returns. This is the abnormal excess return of the dirty portfolio over and above that of the clean portfolio. By definition, it is also equal to the difference in alphas between the dirty and the clean portfolios. The size and significance of the carbon premium is the main focus of our empirical analysis.

Consistent with our preliminary analysis, our main finding is that there is a high and significant carbon premium for the sample period that begins in November 2003 and ends in March 2009. This finding is illustrated in Figure 3, which plots a rolling estimate of the carbon premium relative to the CAPM using a three-year rolling window. Statistical significance is assessed by plotting rolling p-values of the alpha based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. Figure 3 identifies the exact timing of when the dirty-minus-clean portfolio delivers a high and significant alpha. The shaded area in the figure corresponds to the critical sample period of November 2003 to March 2009. The figure reveals that the alpha is high and significant only during this sample period but not immediately before or after. To be more specific, the figure suggests that the good performance of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio:

- (i) begins around November 2003, which is more than a year before the implementation of Phase I in January 2005;
- (ii) it then continues during all of Phase I (2005-2008);
- (iii) it diminishes in the first year of Phase II (2008); and
- (iv) it disappears afterwards.

These results are further illustrated in Table 3. Specifically, the carbon premium relative to the CAPM is 16.8% and highly significant for the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009, but falls to 2.9% and becomes insignificant when the sample period extends to the end of Phase II in December 2012. It is also interesting to note that in Phase I (2005-2007) the carbon premium is 15.3% and significant, whereas in Phase II (2008-2012) it is 8.2% and insignificant. The results are similar using the FF3 and FF4 factor models.

Overall, this evidence suggests that the carbon premium is present for the period that the market knew with certainty that carbon emitting firms will be receiving allowances for free. This is because:

- (i) the appearance of the carbon premium coincides with the passing of the EU law establishing the ETS with free allocation of allowances; and
- (ii) the disappearance of the carbon premium coincides with the passing of an EU law stipulating that allowances will be mainly sold in auctions beginning in 2013.

It is therefore likely that the carbon premium may have been a one-off event, which was only present during this particular period as it was.

14

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497

driven by the free allocation of carbon allowances and lasted for as long as the law stipulated the allocation will be free.

In conclusion, the presence of a high and significant carbon premium over the sample period identified in Figure 3 is a new and important result. This finding strongly supports the first testing hypothesis (H1) implied by the economic mechanism discussed in Section 3. A high and significant carbon premium confirms empirically that carbon emitting firms are substantially overcompensated by receiving free carbon emission allowances as indicated by the theoretical work of Demailly and Quirion (2009) and Goulder, Hafstead and Dworsky (2010) among others. In this context, our analysis contributes to the current environmental policy debate because, in addition to helping us understand the workings of the EU ETS, it informs policy-makers and investors about the design and implications of similar cap-and-trade environmental regulation implemented elsewhere.

# 7 The Price of Carbon Risk

This section evaluates the effect of carbon risk on the cross-section of expected stock returns. Our empirical analysis is based on Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions. In line with standard practice in asset pricing, we proxy carbon risk by the “dirty-minus-clean” (DMC) risk factor. This is a zero-investment portfolio defined as the expected return on the equally weighted portfolio of the eight dirty stocks minus the expected return on the equally weighted portfolio of the 41 clean stocks. Note that the DMC factor is the expected return of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio, whereas the carbon premium is the alpha of the same portfolio.

We implement the Fama and MacBeth (1973) procedure in the standard two stages. First, we use time-series regressions to estimate the betas on the CAPM, the three-factor Fama-French (1993) model and the four-factor Carhart (1997) model, while adding the DMC factor to all these specifications. In the second stage, we implement a cross-sectional regression of the average returns of all 65 stocks on their betas. The slopes of the cross-sectional regression deliver the price of risk for each factor.

For robustness, in addition to the standard four factors we also specify an industry factor as well as a series of other factors recently proposed in the asset pricing literature. The industry factor (IND) is generated by grouping the 65 stocks in 10 industry portfolios using the Fama-French industry definitions. Then, we estimate the beta of each stock on the excess return to the equally weighted industry portfolio it belongs to, while also conditioning on

15

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497

the excess return of the market. We use the industry betas as an independent variable in the cross-sectional regressions and we report the price of risk. This captures the cross-sectional variation of the sensitivity to the industry factor.

We also use six additional control variables, which are specified as follows: (i) MAX is the Bali, Cakici and Whitelaw (2011) measure of the maximum daily return within a month for each stock; (ii) ILLIQ is the Amihud (2002) measure of stock illiquidity for each stock defined as the ratio of the absolute stock return to its dollar trading volume. As with the standard factors, we estimate the beta of each stock on MAX and ILLIQ separately, and then use these betas in the cross-sectional regressions; (iii) IVOL is the Ang, Hodrick, Xing and Zhang (2006) measure of idiosyncratic volatility estimated as the standard deviation of the residuals to the three-factor Fama-French (1993) regression for each stock; (iv) COSKEW is the Harvey and Siddique (2000) measure of coskewness measured as the beta on the squared excess market return for each stock, while also conditioning on the excess market return; (v) downside beta is the Ang, Chen and Xing (2006) measure of the CAPM beta using only observations for which the market return is less than its mean; (vi) and, similarly, upside beta is the CAPM beta using only observations for which the market return is greater or equal than its mean. Note that when conditioning on downside beta and upside beta, we remove the full sample beta (denoted by MKT in the table) to avoid multicollinearity.

# 4 Findings

Table 4 presents the results, which can be summarized in the following four findings: (i) for the shorter sample of November 2003 to March 2009, the DMC factor has a positive price of risk, which is highly significant in all cases. This implies that the higher a firm’s exposure to carbon risk, the higher the expected return, even when conditioning on a large number of control variables; (ii) for this sample, the DMC factor alone accounts for one-third of the cross-sectional variation of stock returns; (iii) however, when using the longer sample of November 2003 to December 2012, the explanatory power of the carbon risk factor diminishes and becomes insignificant; and (iv) overall the model specification that conditions on all control variables accounts for more than 90% of the cross-sectional variation of stock returns in either sample.

These results indicate that carbon risk can explain a large part of the variation of stock returns for the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009. For this sample, therefore, firms that have a high exposure to carbon risk (i.e., dirty firms) require higher expected returns. This provides direct empirical support for the second testing hypothesis (H2) for

# 8 Robustness and Further Analysis

This section extends the empirical analysis in several directions in order to assess the robustness of our main finding on the carbon premium.

# 8.1 The Carbon Premium, the EUA Price and Energy Factors

First, we provide an empirical examination of whether the carbon premium can be explained by conditioning on the price for carbon allowances and the price of energy indexes such as electricity, oil, natural gas and coal.

In line with Daskalakis, Psychoyios and Markellos (2009) and Koch and Bassen (2013), for the price of carbon allowances we consider monthly settlement prices of EUA futures contracts traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the European Climate Exchange (ECX). We construct a continuous price series that combines a series of contracts as follows. In Phase I, the EUA price series is equal to the price of the December 2008 contract. In Phase II, the EUA price series uses the December 2009 contract until its last trading day, then switches to the December 2010 contract until its last trading day, and so on until December 2012. Figure 4 plots the EUA futures price in euros.

Following prior literature (e.g., Oberndorfer, 2009, and Koch and Bassen, 2013), for oil, gas and coal prices we use the following one-month futures contracts: the Brent crude oil front-month forward from Independent Commodity Information Services (ICIS); the front-month natural gas forward from the ICE; and the one-month ahead New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures contract for coal converted to euros. Note that the European counterpart to this contract (i.e., the one-month ahead API 2 coal futures contract delivered to Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp) is not available for the full sample but the correlation in the two series is about 90%. Finally, for electricity prices, we use the Phelix Month Base from the EEX in Leipzig as in Oberndorfer (2009).

All these data are taken from various sources. The sharp decline in the EUA price around the end of April 2006 is the focus of Hintermann (2010), Bushnell, Chong and Mansur (2013) and Jong, Couwenberg and Woerdman (2014). These papers argue that the decline was primarily due to the release of information about aggregate EU emissions indicating an unanticipated surplus in available EUAs. For studies on the time-series behavior of EUA prices, see also Paolella and Taschini (2008), Benz and Truck (2009), and Daskalakis, Psychoyios and Markellos (2009).

from Datastream. In all cases, we use the price data to generate a time series for the return to each variable. For example, we compute the return to the EUA as: rEUA;t = ln(PEU A;t) - ln(PEU A;t - 1), where PEU A;t is the EUA price series at time t. Similarly, we compute roil;t, rgas;t, rcoal;t, and relec;t. We then use the dirty-minus-clean portfolio returns to estimate the CAPM with these additional explanatory variables. This allows us to assess the significance of these additional factors (rEUA;t, roil;t, rgas;t, rcoal;t, relec;t) and the extent to which they can affect the alpha of the regression (i.e., the carbon premium).

# 8.1

Table 5 reports results for two sample periods: one period ranges from May 2005 to March 2009; and the second one from May 2005 to December 2012. Note that, for this table only, we begin the regressions in May 2005 because EUA trading begins in April 2005 and hence the first observation for rEUA;t is available in May 2005.

We find that the sensitivity (beta) of the EUA, oil, gas and coal returns is positive, whereas for electricity returns it is negative. However, in all cases, the betas are insignificant. More importantly, when conditioning on these additional variables, the alpha (i.e., the carbon premium) remains largely unaffected as it is still high (about 18%) and statistically significant for the sample period that ends in March 2009. Therefore, for this sample period the carbon premium remains intact even after we account for movements in the EUA price and energy factor prices.

# 8.2 The Carbon Premium and the Number of Carbon Allowances

The carbon premium depends crucially on how the dirty portfolio is defined. Our main analysis places in the dirty portfolio the eight firms which received annually more than one million free EUAs. We assess the sensitivity of the carbon premium to the composition of the dirty portfolio with two robustness checks. For both checks, we focus on the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009, when the carbon premium is found to be high and significant.

First, we maintain the same composition for the dirty portfolio that contains eight stocks, and assess whether the carbon premium is driven by any one particular stock. Figure 5 displays the alpha of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio when one of the eight stocks is dropped from the dirty portfolio. In other words, this shows the carbon premium for alternative dirty portfolios when any seven of the eight original stocks are used. We find that overall

18

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2189497

The carbon premium is not driven by a single stock. The eight-stock portfolio delivers a CAPM-based carbon premium of 16.8%. The lowest CAPM-based carbon premium among the seven-stock portfolios is around 14%, which corresponds to the case of the chemical company SDF being dropped. Using any one of the seven-stock dirty portfolios gives similar results to using the eight-stock dirty portfolio. We conclude, therefore, that the carbon premium remains largely unaffected when we exclude any one stock, including the one with the largest effect.

Second, we use alternative criteria for inclusion of stocks into the dirty portfolio. As seen in Table 6, when the cutoff point of carbon allowances reduces from one million EUAs to 0.5 million EUAs, the number of stocks increases from eight to 10. Similarly, at 0.1 million EUAs, there are 14 stocks in the dirty portfolio and, finally, when all dirty stocks are included their number reaches a maximum of 24. In setting a lower number of EUAs as the criterion for inclusion in the dirty portfolio, we find that the alphas decrease monotonically. The decay is initially slow and then accelerates as more firms are included in the dirty portfolio. Specifically, the CAPM-based carbon premium is as follows: for the eight-stock portfolio it is 16.8% and significant; it decreases to 13.9% for the 10-stock portfolio and is still significant; then goes down further to 11.1% for the 14-stock portfolio and is still significant; and, finally, ends at 4.3% for the all-inclusive portfolio but now is insignificant.

These results are graphically illustrated in Figure 6. The figure shows the annualized CAPM-based carbon premium when we add one stock at a time to the original dirty portfolio of eight stocks. The stocks are added in sequence according to the number of their carbon allowances: each time the stock with the highest number of carbon allowances not already in the portfolio is added to it. The figure also shows the 95% confidence interval of the CAPM-based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. The figure clearly illustrates the monotonicity in the relation of performance and carbon allowances: the more stocks we add to the dirty portfolio, the lower the number of carbon emissions the additional stock contributes to the portfolio, and the lower the CAPM of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio. This is further evidence that high carbon emissions lead to high abnormal excess returns for our sample.

# 8.3 The Carbon Premium and the Number of Firms

Our analysis uses data on 65 of the 80 firms included in the DAX and MDAX stock indexes. We exclude the 15 firms for which we do not have monthly return observations for the full sample period. For robustness, we also assess the performance of the carbon portfolios when all 80 stocks are included in the analysis. We do so by using all available data on all stocks, where for 15 stocks the data available is shorter than the full sample. This approach implies that the composition of the portfolios changes over time. The effect of the inclusion of additional stocks on the portfolio composition is as follows: the dirty portfolio still has the same 8 stocks; the medium portfolio now has a maximum of 21 stocks, which is 5 stocks more than previously; and the clean portfolio has a maximum of 51 stocks, which is 10 more stocks.

Table 7 shows that the results remain qualitatively the same and, overall, the carbon premium is in fact slightly higher. For the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009, the 80-stock cross-section delivers a highly significant carbon premium relative to the CAPM of 18.6% compared to 16.8% for the 65-stock cross-section. For the full sample period of November 2003 to December 2012, the carbon premium is 4.4% relative to 2.9% previously. For Phase I it is 17.6% compared to 15.3% previously. Finally, for Phase II it is 7.1% compared to 8.2% previously. In conclusion, therefore, our main findings are not affected by the inclusion of additional stocks for which the available data does not cover the full sample.

# 9 Extension: Evidence from the UK

In this section we provide an empirical investigation of the carbon premium for a second major European economy: the UK. This allows us to assess whether the carbon premium is predominantly a feature of the German economy or a feature that is also present elsewhere in Europe. For this purpose, we build a second data set on carbon emission allowances that is specific to the UK. In particular, we focus on the 100 UK firms that belong to the FTSE 100 stock index, which capture more than 80% of the UK stock market capitalization.

In similar fashion to the German data, the UK data on carbon emission allowances have been collected manually. We use the Community Independent Transaction Log (CITL) database set up by the European Commission to manually match each production facility.

(installation) to the Örm it belongs to. This is a painstaking process as some Örms have numerous installations, often with di§erent names, each receiving a di§erent number of carbon allowances. All these installations are then manually matched to the parent Örm that is listed in the stock exchange. Finally, we aggregate across installations for each Örm to determine the total number of free EUAs issued to each UK Örm.

Armed with these data, we build a dirty portfolio of all 16 Örms that have received carbon allowances and a clean portfolio of all 67 Örms that did not receive any carbon allowances. Hence we use data for 83 of the 100 Örms for which we have monthly return observations for the full sample period of November 2003 to December 2012. Note that for the UK data we place all dirty Örms in one portfolio and hence we do not distinguish between dirty and medium Örms. This is because in the UK there are very few Örms with a large number of carbon allowances. For instance, had we deÖned dirty Örms as those receiving more than one million allowances, then only four Örms would satisfy this criterion. Indeed, the majority of the 16 dirty Örms received no more than 100,000 allowances. Furthermore, the market value of the average UK dirty Örm is lower than in Germany and, therefore, the average UK dirty Örm needs less carbon allowances than in Germany. Therefore, our analysis is based on the argument that the distinct structure of the UK market justiÖes placing all dirty Örms in one portfolio.

In the asset pricing regressions, we use data on UK Fama-French factors provided by the XÖ Centre for Finance and Investment at the University of Exeter. These data are speciÖcally constructed for the UK economy and are discussed in Gregory, Tharayan and Christidis (2013).

Our main Önding is that the UK results are qualitatively similar to the German results. Figure 7 plots the rolling carbon premium for the UK and shows the striking similarity between Germany and the UK. The Ögure reveals that the timing for the carbon premium in Germany and the UK is the same: the carbon premium begins at the end of 2003, grows dramatically during Phase I, diminishes in Phase II and disappears after 2009. Table 8 reports more detailed results. Notably the UK carbon premium is high and signiÖcant in Phase I but not for the other sample periods. Overall, this empirical evidence conÖrms the presence of a carbon premium in the UK that lasted for as long as it did in Germany.

# 10 Discussion and Conclusions

The EU ETS is the world’s first and largest multinational cap-and-trade program for regulating carbon emissions. At the center of this scheme is the creation of a new market for trading carbon emission allowances. From 2013 onwards, these allowances are auctioned off at a price thus generating significant revenues for EU governments. From 2005 to 2012, however, during the initial two phases of the ETS, allowances were granted to carbon emitting firms for free. As a result, firms receiving these allowances could either sell them for profit or they could use them for production thus making these allowances an opportunity cost to be accounted for in setting prices and quantities.

The free allocation of carbon allowances in the initial two phases of the ETS is a crucial aspect of the scheme. Previous theoretical work suggests that the free allocation overcompensates firms and can lead to large increases in profits. The mechanism that leads to substantial additional profits for carbon emitting firms has two direct channels: (i) firms face higher marginal costs, which to a large extent are passed through to consumers through higher output prices, thus increasing firm revenue; and (ii) output falls and, since carbon allowances are allocated freely, the allowances not used in production can be sold for a profit. In a separate argument, carbon emitting firms are exposed to higher risk and hence require higher expected returns due to uncertainty about the future price of carbon allowances, which also generates uncertainty about future cash flows.

This paper fills a gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive empirical evaluation of whether firms that received carbon emission allowances significantly outperformed firms that did not. In particular, we examine the effect of the EU ETS on stock returns. We do so by assessing the size, significance and timing of the carbon premium, which is defined as the abnormal excess return of a portfolio of dirty firms over and above the abnormal excess return of a portfolio of clean firms in the context of standard asset pricing models. Our analysis focuses on Germany, which is the largest market affected by the ETS, but for robustness we also examine data from the UK.

Our main finding is that there is a large and statistically significant carbon premium in stock returns. The carbon premium can be as high as 17% and highly significant for the sample period that begins in November 2003 and ends in March 2009. This sample period begins with the passing of an EU law establishing the initial two phases of the EU ETS and ends with the passing of another EU law establishing Phase III of the EU ETS beginning in

2013 during which carbon allowances are mainly sold in auctions. Hence this is the period over which the market knew with certainty that carbon emitting Örms will be receiving free carbon allowances. Our evidence clearly indicates that after March 2009 the carbon premium dissipates. Furthermore, the timing of the carbon premium based on German data is conÖrmed when using UK data.

Our cross-sectional analysis indicates that for the relevant sample period, we can con- struct a carbon risk factor based on the returns of the dirty-minus-clean portfolio, which can explain a considerable part of the cross-sectional variation in expected stock returns. For this sample period, the signiÖcance of the carbon risk factor is robust to the inclusion of a large set of control variables. This suggests that Örms with high carbon emissions have higher exposure to carbon risk and exhibit higher expected returns.

As a Önal note, the evidence suggests that a carbon premium is present for a speciÖc period that commences about one year before the beginning of Phase I and disappears about one year into Phase II. It is possible, therefore, that the carbon premium may have been a one-o§ event, which was only present during this particular period. Indeed, this is likely as the carbon premium is primarily driven by the free allocation of carbon allowances. Still, our analysis contributes to the current environmental policy debate because it informs policy-makers and investors about the design and implications of similar cap-and-trade en- vironmental regulation implemented elsewhere.

# Table 2. Descriptive Statistics

The table reports monthly descriptive statistics for 65 German stocks included in the DAX and MDAX indexes for two sample periods: November 2003 to March 2009 and November 2003 to December 2012. ME is the average market value of equity in million euros over the longer sample period. Free allowances is the average number of carbon emission allowances issued annually and is measured in million. “Dirty” are firms which were issued allowances and “clean” are firms which were not. The dirty firms are listed by the number of allowances, whereas the clean firms are listed alphabetically. The mean, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio of monthly returns are reported in annualized units.

# Table 3. The Performance of Carbon Portfolios

The table presents the performance of carbon portfolios. Dirty is a portfolio of Örms, which during the initial two phases of the EU ETS received annually more than 1 million free carbon emission allowances. Medium is a portfolio of Örms, which for the same period received more than zero but less than 1 million free carbon allowances. Clean is a portfolio of Örms, which did not receive any carbon allowances. All portfolios are formed with equal weights. The mean, standard deviation and Sharpe ratio of monthly returns are reported in annualized units. CAPM-a is the alpha of a CAPM regression, FF3-a is the alpha of the Fama-French (1993) 3-factor regression, FF4-a is the alpha of the Carhart (1997) 4-factor regression. All alphas are annualized. t-statistics based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors are reported in parentheses. The asterisks *, ** and *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level respectively.

# Table 5. The Carbon Premium, the EUA Price and Energy Factors

The table presents the carbon premium, which is the alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio, for three regressions: (i) the plain CAPM, (ii) the CAPM with the log-price change to the EUA, and (iii) the CAPM with the log-price change to the EUA and the log-price change to four energy factors: oil, gas, coal and electricity. a is the annualized intercept of the CAPM regression and are the slopes on the log-price changes to the EUA and the four energy factors. t-statistics based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors are in parentheses. The asterisks *, ** and *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level respectively. The two sample periods begin in May 2005, which is the earliest month for which we have an observation for the return to the EUA. The first sample period ends in March 2009 and the second period in December 2012.

# Figure 3. The Carbon Premium

The figure plots a rolling estimate of the annualized carbon premium (solid blue line) using a three-year rolling window. The carbon premium is defined as the CAPM-alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio. The figure also plots the p-value of the carbon premium (dashed green line) based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. The units of the alpha are shown on the left vertical axis, whereas the units of the p-value on the right vertical axis. Each alpha is plotted at the midpoint of the rolling window, thus using 18 months of data before this point and 18 months of data after. The shaded area corresponds to the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009.

The figure plots in euros the futures price of the European Union Allowance (EUA) over time. We construct a continuous price series that combines a series of contracts as follows. In Phase I, the EUA price series is equal to the price of the December 2008 contract. In Phase II, the EUA price series uses the December 2009 contract until its last trading day, then switches to the December 2010 contract until its last trading day, and so on until December 2012.

The figure displays the annualized alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio when one of the eight stocks is dropped from the Dirty portfolio. The sample period ranges from November 2003 to March 2009. The original Dirty portfolio includes eight firms (ALL in the figure), which during each of the initial two phases of the EU ETS have received more than 1 million free carbon emission allowances. The horizontal axis shows the ticker of each stock dropped at a time from the Dirty portfolio. CAPM-a is the intercept of a CAPM regression, FF3-a is the intercept of the Fama-French (1993) 3-factor model regression, FF4-a is the intercept of the Carhart (1997) 4-factor regression.

# Figure 6. The Carbon Premium for More Dirty Stocks

The figure shows the annualized CAPM-alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio (solid line) when we add one stock at a time to the original Dirty portfolio of eight stocks. The sample period ranges from November 2003 to March 2009. The figure also shows the 95% confidence interval of the CAPM-alpha (dotted lines) based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. The original Dirty portfolio includes eight firms, which during each of the initial two phases of the EU ETS have received more than 1 million free carbon emission allowances. The sequence with which the stocks are added to the original portfolio is determined by their carbon allowances: each time the stock with the highest number of carbon allowances not already in the portfolio is added to it. The maximum number of stocks receiving carbon allowances is 24.

# Figure 7. The UK Carbon Premium

The figure plots a rolling estimate of the annualized carbon premium for the UK (solid blue line) using a three-year rolling window. The carbon premium is defined as the CAPM-alpha of the Dirty-minus-Clean portfolio. The figure also plots the p-value of the carbon premium (dashed green line) based on Newey-West (1987) standard errors. The units of the alpha are shown on the left vertical axis, whereas the units of the p-value on the right vertical axis. Each alpha is plotted at the midpoint of the rolling window, thus using 18 months of data before this point and 18 months of data after. The shaded area corresponds to the sample period of November 2003 to March 2009.

# Abstract

This study provides evidence on the existence of a negative Greenium, i.e. a risk premium linked to firms’ greenness and environmental transparency, based on European individual stock returns. We define a priced ‘greenness and transparency’ factor based on companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and the quality of their environmental disclosures. Based on this factor, we offer a tool to assess the exposure of a portfolio to the risk associated with the low-carbon transition, and hedge against it. We estimate that in a stressed scenario where greener and more transparent firms very much outperform brown stocks, there would be losses at the global level, including for European large banks, should investors fail to price climate-transition risks. These results call for the introduction of climate stress tests for systemically important financial institutions.

# 1 Introduction

Climate change is a fact, but we are not sure what the economic costs associated with this change will be.1 By the same token, it is difficult to estimate what the economic benefits of doing something about it would be. In particular, it would be hard to pin down the net present value of activities aimed at climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as those directed to broader environmental objectives such as the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, waste prevention and recycling, pollution prevention and control, and the protection of healthy ecosystems.2 At the same time, the consequences of a transition to a low-carbon, resource-efficient and circular economy, or lack thereof, are also largely uncertain. Hence, these issues have to be addressed as aspects of long-run risk. The contribution of this paper is to measure the added value of greener economic activities in terms of market excess returns. To do so, we first show that indeed, the European market prices climate risk in the form of a greenness and environmental transparency factor, in the context of a standard asset pricing model. Second, we estimate that the market associates a negative risk premium, which we label Greenium, to more environmentally friendly and transparent firms.

We identify the greenness and transparency factor based on a precise definition. In particular, we first construct portfolios characterized by a different shade of green and a different degree of environmental transparency. This is based on firm-level information on greenhouse gas (GHG) or CO2 emissions, combined with a measure of the completeness of firms’ environmental disclosures, to yield a synthetic greenness and transparency index for each stock. Companies which disclose a lower emission intensity, and are very transparent, attain the highest scores and are included in a greener and more transparent portfolio. The most straightforward example of greener companies would be those with a large share of their turnover in green economic sectors, e.g. renewable energy. Conversely, companies which do not disclose information on their environmental performance are labeled as non-transparent. Among these nontransparent companies, those active in carbon-intensive sectors, e.g. companies operating coal power plants, are included in a brown portfolio. The greenness and transparency factor is constructed based on 942 companies listed on the STOXX Europe Total Market Index.

By relying on company-level disclosures and factoring-in their transparency, we try to tackle the issue of green-washing, which is likely to be the reason why the literature has so far failed to find a consensus on the existence of a priced green factor. Indeed, looking at the actual composition of the portfolios of publicly traded investment funds which label themselves as ‘green’ or ‘sustainable’, it turns out that many funds are clearly less environmentally friendly than their name would suggest. For example, a fund might indeed limit its exposure to carbon-intensive sectors, but at the same time mainly invest in e.g. financial stocks. Banks, insurers and other financial institutions are admittedly directly responsible for a very small fraction of GHG emissions, but financial institutions are prob-

1 On the uncertainty on the rate of increase in average temperatures in the long-medium horizon, and on the effects of climate change, see e.g. Pindyck (2013). 2 These objectives are listed in the European Commission Action plan on financing sustainable growth, which sets out an EU strategy for sustainable finance.

ably not what comes to mind when thinking of companies that are at the forefront of efforts to reduce emissions. At the level of the individual company, there could be a tendency to disclose only partial information, emphasizing the environmental dimensions where the firm performs best and neglecting those where the firm does not as well. For example, a car manufacturer may report its scope 1 GHG emissions, i.e. emissions from sources that it owns or controls, but could have an incentive not to disclose its scope 3 emissions, which include emissions resulting from the use of the vehicles it produces and sells. By considering the completeness of the relevant information that firms disclose, we deal with this type of greenwashing.

At the same time, however, one should be careful not to take extreme views when defining ‘green’ stocks. As a matter of fact, portfolio diversification is crucial for asset managers, and concentrating the exposure on a small set of pure green players is not a viable option. Our society will still need e.g. steel and cement for quite a while, and companies’ low-carbon transition is a much needed but gradual process. For all these reasons, a sensible approach would be to broaden the scope of the definition of ‘green’ beyond pure players to also include firms that meet the highest level of energy efficiency and the lowest CO2 emissions within the relevant sector. By taking this approach, a steel manufacturer which also uses scrap steel is greener than one that does not. By the same token, an energy company that reduces its reliance on fossil fuels – though not having an entirely renewable energy mix – is greener than one that is not reducing its carbon footprint. This is the approach taken by several providers of environmental ratings, which assess the sustainability of firms relative to their peers, and also the one we take in this paper.

We show that in the context of a standard asset pricing model, the portfolios we build based on firms’ environmental performance and disclosures are associated with a positive intercept, suggesting the existence of an omitted factor. Based on this evidence, we propose to include a greenness and transparency factor, which we construct based on a long-short strategy involving the greener and more transparent portfolio and the brown portfolio. We find that the Greenium, i.e. the risk premium associated with this greenness and transparency factor, is negative and highly statistically significant. This means that investors accept a lower remuneration for their investments, ceteris paribus, insofar as these investments are linked to greener and more transparent firms. We interpret this as evidence of climate risk being viewed as significant, with the market seeing value in investing in greener assets as a hedging strategy towards worse environmental outcomes.

Indeed, in a scenario of heightened risks resulting from climate change, there would be a stronger push towards more environmentally friendly activities, with more decisive political action likely to be taken to promote sustainable growth. Hence, companies active in green sectors and more transparent on their environmental performance would operate in a more favorable environment, possibly supported by incentives, e.g. fiscal or of other nature. At the same time, the likelihood would increase that some assets, e.g. coal, would become stranded. In this context, forward-looking investors who base their portfolio allocation on a broader information set than past returns, invest in greener assets already today.

The evidence we provide on the existence of a Greenium has clear financial stability implications. Indeed, we show that the European market as a whole does price climate risk. In this context, if an investor does not factor in

Climate risk in the construction of her portfolio, she is in fact pricing her holdings based on a misspecified model, where the greenness and environmental transparency factor is omitted. Should this mispricing affect the assets held by systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) such as large banks, insurers and pension funds, there could be consequences in terms of systemic risk. In particular, asset returns on their holdings could be negatively affected by climate change via two main channels. First, in a longer horizon perspective, more frequent and severe natural catastrophes stemming from climate change (e.g. typhoons and floods) could negatively affect returns on assets linked to particularly vulnerable economic activities. These are the so-called physical risks related to climate change, that we do not tackle in this paper directly. However, it has been shown that rising temperatures have strong adverse effects on asset valuations, as well as on key macroeconomic aggregates and productivity (see Donadelli et al., 2017). Second, in a medium-term perspective, the implementation of sustainable finance policies will imply higher costs for firms with higher emissions, causing a generalized drop in the dividend that brown firms will be able to pay to their shareholders. In parallel, carbon-intensive assets will increasingly become ‘stranded’ (see Campiglio et al., 2017). This is the so-called transition risk. These two channels characterize a climate risk factor that investors should price.

Based on our model, we estimate that in an extreme but plausible scenario where greener and more transparent companies outperform brown companies, all institutional sectors at the global level, including e.g. governments, non-financial institutions and financial corporations, as well as all European SIFIs, would be hit by losses. By halving their exposure to carbon-intensive sectors and reallocating their investments towards greener assets, investors could somewhat reduce the loss. However, they could only avoid losing money if they would reallocate their investments towards greener and more transparent firms. The magnitude of the expected losses we estimate is admittedly not breathtaking. Still, we show that no one is in a safe place when it comes to climate risk, as the consequences of brown asset mispricing would be widespread. Moreover, our analysis is limited to equity holdings, that for some investors are not as relevant as other types of exposures. In a stressed scenario, however, losses would almost certainly be recorded also on the bond portfolio and notably, on banks’ loan exposure. Finally, we use a simple model to compute losses, based on the marginal expected shortfall. This approach does not factor in losses resulting from second-round effects, like fire sales, which could magnify first-round losses. Taking all this into account, we conclude that a climate or climate-policy shock could have serious implications in terms of financial stability, especially if coupled with shocks of other nature. Hence, we argue that a climate stress test is warranted for systemically important institutions to monitor their resilience to climate change. The greenness and transparency factor we construct could indeed be used by investors, to hedge against climate risk, and by supervisors, to measure SIFIs exposure to this risk. Notice that looking ahead, we can only expect greater policy pressure to reducing carbon.

# emissions and moving to a sustainable development path.

The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we provide an overview of the relevant literature. In Section 3, we present our synthetic greenness and transparency indicator at the level of the individual company. Section 4 outlines the asset pricing theoretical framework. In Section 5, we present the results of the empirical application. First, we focus on portfolios by estimating the standard asset pricing models and defining the greenness and transparency factor. Then, we estimate our proposed model on individual stocks. In Section 6 we carry out a battery of robustness checks. Section 7 tests the performance of the equity portfolios of global institutional sectors and European SIFIs in a climate-stressed scenario. Section 8 concludes.

# 2 Related literature

This paper stands at the crossroad of sustainable finance, asset pricing and financial stability. The sustainable finance literature has so far mostly focused on corporate performance, starting from the seminal work by Bragdon and Marlin (1972). They asked the fundamental question, whether there would be a reward for a company’s virtue. Trying to answer this question, Porter (1991), Gore (1993), and Porter and van der Linde (1995) argue that improving a company environmental performance can lead to a better economic or financial performance, not necessarily accompanied by an increase in costs. Ambec and Lanoie (2008) review several empirical works showing that improvements in the environmental performance of a firm tend to be associated with improvements in its economic or financial performance, owing to potential revenue increases and/or cost cuts. More recently, Hoepner et al. (2018) show that engagement on sustainability issues can benefit shareholders’ by reducing firms’ downside risks.

Despite increasingly available evidence on the performance of green or sustainable corporates, however, no consensus has yet been reached in the asset pricing literature about the performance of green assets, or on environmental risk being a priced macro factor. Evidence based on a large number of studies on the performance of sustainable investment funds compared with conventional peers (e.g., Statman, 2000; Renneboog et al., 2007; Seitz, 2010) is mixed. For example, Hartzmark and Sussman (2019) find that sustainability is viewed as positively predicting future performance; however, they do not find evidence of outperformance of ‘high sustainability’ investment funds vs ‘low sustainability’ ones. Trinks et al. (2018) show that divesting from fossil fuels does not impair portfolio performance. On the contrary, Bolton and Kacperczyk (2019) find that stocks of companies with higher CO2 emission intensity earn higher returns. Other analyses based on publicly traded environmental portfolios find that green stocks are, on average, underperforming the market. This finding would indicate that investors are willing to earn comparatively less on these assets because they are hedging an environmental long-run risk. Finally, recent papers attempt to build climate risk hedging portfolios (see Engle et al., 2020, Choi et al., 2020, Hong et al., 2019, Alok).

Andersson et al. (2016) shows that divestment in higher emission stocks entails a cost, which investors are more likely to bear the stronger the perception of a serious commitment on the side of policymakers towards fighting climate change.

et al., 2020 and Goergen et al., 2019, Monasterolo and De Angelis, 2020); however, none of these works goes all the way to quantifying the associated risk premium.

Finally, the financial stability literature has started to put forward the idea of ‘climate stress tests’ on the exposures of financial institutions (see Battiston et al., 2017 and Battiston and Monasterolo, 2018), as well as to develop climate stress-test methodologies for e.g. loan portfolios (see Monasterolo et al., 2018). Central Banks and international institutions, starting with the seminal speech by Carney (2015), have also emphasized on different occasions that climate change could affect systemic risk. In particular, Gros et al. (2016) distinguishes between a benign scenario, with a gradual transition to a low-carbon economy, and an adverse scenario, where the transition occurs more abruptly. In both cases, there could be financial stability consequences: with a too slow transition, the Paris Agreement goal would be missed and the catastrophic consequences of climate change would become unavoidable.5 A too quick transition, on the other hand, would imply a sudden repricing of brown assets. We provide evidence that these concerns are shared by the market.

# 3 Synthetic greenness and transparency indicator

Different indicators are available to assess a company’s commitment to the environment. However, identifying synthetic proxies for firms’ environmental performance is not obvious and no consensus has yet been reached in the literature on this issue (see Oikonomou et al., 2012). The main source of information in this respect are firms’ environmental disclosures, which are typically published by companies in their annual reports, or in separate Corporate Social Responsibility or Sustainability reports, as well as in dedicated ESG releases or Corporate Governance reports. Based on these disclosures, investors distinguish companies that are doing green business from firms that are not, or that are not transparent in this respect. However, a single indicator might not be sufficient to ensure a careful assessment of a company’s environmental performance. Hence, we look at both of the following two dimensions: i) environmental transparency, related to the quality of firms’ environmental disclosures, and ii) GHG emissions.

As a proxy for the environmental transparency of a company we use the Bloomberg Environmental disclosure score, which we refer to as E score.6 This is an index quantifying the completeness of a firm’s disclosure on its impact on the environment. The E score embraces several environmental aspects of a firm’s business. In particular, it looks at how transparent a company is with respect to its carbon emissions, air and water pollution, its commitment to the protection of biodiversity, and its waste management, among others. The weighted E score is normalized to range from zero for companies that do not disclose environmental data to 100 for those which disclose detailed information for each pillar. The score is also tailored for industry sectors, and each component is weighted based on its importance. In particular, GHG emission disclosure is attached the highest weight.

5 The objective of the Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, is to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

6 MSCI, RobecoSAM, Sustainalytics and Asset4 also provide E disclosure scores based on different methodologies.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649

We use the E score as a measure of the transparency of a firm with respect to its environmental sustainability commitment, and assume that higher commitment is associated with higher transparency. In other words, based on the E score, we make a first selection among firms that are transparent, at least to some extent, about their environmental performance, and firms that are not. We do not claim that firms that do not disclose information on environmental issues are necessarily ecologically destructive. However, we find it legitimate to label them as non-green, as their environmental commitment appears weaker compared to firms that do disclose (quantitative) information on this pillar. Moreover, Marquis et al. (2016) show that more environmentally friendly firms tend to disclose more because they know that their environmental performance is generally better than the one of their peers, while more environmentally damaging firms are indeed less likely to engage in non-mandatory disclosure, in particular in those countries where they are more exposed to scrutiny and norms.

To build a comprehensive index of a company’s environmental performance, we combine this transparency measure with quantitative disclosure on emissions. In particular, we consider the total GHG emission intensity, i.e. the total amount on GHG emissions normalized by revenues. If this is not available, we take the total carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted, weighted by revenues. The synthetic greenness and transparency indicator Gi,y of company i at year y is defined as the weighted average of the two components, as follows:

Gi,y = γKi,y + (1 − γ)Ei,y , with γ ∈ [0, 1],

(1)

where Ki,y is the inverse of the ranking of firm i in term of emission intensity, and Ei,y is the ranking of firm i in term of E score. The parameter γ controls for the relative importance of the two components of the index. We set γ = 0.5 as benchmark case, and show results for γ = 0.2 and γ = 0.8 as robustness checks in Section 6. More transparent companies, for a given level of intensity of GHG or CO2 emissions, are associated with larger values of the indicator Gi,y. Firms that attain a lower emission intensity, for a given level of transparency, are also associated with larger values of Gi,y.

Figure 1 shows the number of companies in our sample which did some environmental disclosure, from 2005 to 2017 (yellow bar). The figure also reports the number of firms that disclosed their emission intensity in a given year (gray bar). The number of companies reporting on their environmental performance has exhibited an upward trend in the last ten years, reaching around 700 EUROSTOXX companies in 2017, i.e. more than half of the sample.

The indicators we use to build the synthetic greenness and transparency indicator have some limitations. First, the analysis provided in Section 5 includes data from 2005, while the Bloomberg ESG application was launched only in 2009. This potentially introduces look-ahead bias (see, e.g., Derwall et al., 2005). However, this bias is mitigated by the availability of firms’ environmental disclosures, including on GHG emissions, also prior to 2009. In other words, market participants could start using the Bloomberg E score as such only as of 2009, but the information.

Figures 2 and 3 in the Appendix plot the greenness and transparency indicator, as well as its components, for two representative companies.

This index is based on was already available to the market. A second issue relates to the self-reported nature of GHG emissions, as well as of other environmental disclosures. As a matter of fact, the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) only requires auditors to verify the publication of non-financial disclosures by relevant firms, but there are no assessment and verification requirements on the content of non-financial disclosures. Based on this, we should emphasize that those firms we identify as greener based on their environmental disclosures may actually be less green than they claim. Still, our asset pricing analysis should not be affected by this problem, insofar as investors base their decisions only on publicly available information as we do. Related to the issue of self-reporting is that of self-selection, due to the fact that unless firms are subject to the NFRD, they are free to choose whether to disclose environmental information. Those that are subject to the NFRD, can choose what to disclose in particular. Typically, self-selection may introduce a bias in the analysis. However, in our case self-selection works in the right direction, as greener firms have an incentive to disclose more and in our framework, firms that are characterized by a lower emission intensity and better environmental disclosures are correctly identified as greener and more transparent. Still, we miss information on those firms that do not disclose. Finally, ESG ratings may differ quite substantially across different data providers, as shown by a growing stream of empirical literature, including, among others, Chatterji et al. (2016), Escrig-Olmedo et al. (2019), and Berg et al. (2019). This latter paper, for example, shows that there is much more disagreement among raters on environmental ratings compared to credit ratings, but still less compared to social and governance ratings. To partly account for the limited reliability of environmental ratings and scores, we use the E score in combination with quantitative data on carbon emissions. We also show Performing the analysis from January 2010 to August 2018 yields empirical results in line with the ones provided in Section 5. See Directive 2014/95/EU. On this point, Short and Toffel (2008) document that firms tend to disclose more when they are immune from prosecution for self-disclosed violations.

that using only one or the other component of the greenness and transparency indicator does not yield meaningful results (see Section 6).

Finally, among non-transparent firms, we further select a subsample that we label ‘brown’. These are companies which are mainly active in sectors characterized by a comparatively higher level of carbon emissions. Information on sectoral emissions in Europe is provided by Eurostat, at the NACE-2 digit level.10 Table 9 in the Appendix lists the economic sectors responsible for the largest amount of carbon emissions in the EU. Overall, these sectors account for 85% of the total GHG emissions in the EU over the 2008-2017 period. Table 10 in the Appendix lists the companies that are included in the brown portfolio in 2017.

# 4 Linear factor model

We assume an approximate factor structure for excess returns combined with the absence of arbitrage opportunities to obtain asset pricing restrictions. As the greenness and transparency indicator defined in Equation (1) is only available for a relatively short sample, we opt for a time-invariant model, which assumes that the exposition of an asset i to each observable factor does not evolve over time. We acknowledge that a model that accounts for time variation in parameters and hence in risk premia would be best suited in this context, owing to the fact that awareness on climate issues has increased over time. However, a time-varying model for the excess returns could only be estimated on a much longer time series and a much larger cross-section than ours. Indeed, it would imply introducing functional specifications for the coefficients, which would result in an incidental parameter problem.

Let us define the excess return on asset i = 1, ..., n at time t = 1, 2, ...T as Ri,t = ri,t − rf,t, where ri,t is the log-return and rf,t is the risk-free return. We assume that the excess return Ri,t satisfies the following linear factor model:

Ri,t = ai + ∑k=1Kbi,kft,k + εi,t,K (2)

where ft,k is the k-th observable factor, with k = 1, ..., K. The error term εi,t is such that E[εi,t|Ft−1] = 0, and Cov[εi,t, ft|Ft−1] = 0, where Ft−1 is the lagged information set. The approximate factor structure holds for the variance-covariance of the error terms, i.e., Σε,t,n = [Cov[εi,t, εj,t|Ft−1]]i,j=1,...,n with bounded largest eigenvalue (see, e.g., Chamberlain and Rothschild, 1983). The following parameter restriction holds:11

ai = ∑k=1Kbi,kνk (3)

where νk is a parameter defined for each k-th factor. The asset pricing restriction in Equation (3) can be rewritten as the usual linear relation between expected excess returns and risk premia:

Source: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database.

We refer to Gagliardini et al. (2016) for theoretical results and proofs.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649

E[Ri,t] = ∑bi,kλk.K (4)

Based on Equations (3) and (4), the time-invariant risk premium associated to each k-th factor is the following:

λk = E[ft,k] + νk. (5)

The risk premium λk is the sum of the expected return on the factor, which can be estimated as its first moment, plus the parameter νk, defined in the asset pricing restriction (3). Risk premia measure how much investors are willing to pay to hedge the systematic risk captured by the observable factors. When the factors are asset returns themselves (i.e., factors are tradable) and are assumed to be priced by the same model in (2), the risk premia are equal to the factor means (see, e.g., Jagannathan and Wang, 2002). However, if factors are non tradable, the parameter νk is non zero. Following Gagliardini et al. (2016), we do not assume a priori that the factors ft,k are tradable. Hence, we allow for the existence of market imperfections, such as transactions costs due to rebalancing and short selling, which are captured by ν (see e.g., Cremers et al., 2012).

Our baseline factor models are summarized in the table below.

|Model|Reference|Abbreviation|Factors|K|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Four-factor model|Carhart (1997)|CAR|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t, fmom,t|4|
|Three-factor model|Fama and French (1993)|3FF|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t|3|
|Capital Asset Pricing Model|Sharpe (1964); Lintner (1965)|CAPM|fm,t|1|

The factors that are included in the models are the following: 1) fm,t is the market factor, defined as the excess return on the European value-weighted market portfolio over the risk free rate; 2) fsmb,t is the size factor, defined as the average return on small caps minus the average return on big caps; 3) fhml,t is the book-to-market factor, defined as the average return on the value portfolio (i.e. stocks that have market value that is small relative to the book value) minus the average return on the growth portfolio; 4) fmom,t is the momentum factor, defined as the average of the returns for the winner portfolio, based on past returns, minus the average of the returns for the loser portfolio. Fama and French (2015) propose a five-factor model including the three Fama-French factors plus profitability and investment factors. However, we do not consider the five-factor model as four factors are enough to explain excess returns in a time-invariant specification, as shown by Gagliardini et al. (2019). By analogy with the fm,t factor, which is constructed based on the T-bill, we proxy the risk free rate with the 30-day T-bill beginning-of-month yield. The time series of European factors and the risk free rate are available on Kenneth French’s website.

# 5 Empirical analysis

In this section, we first compare greener and more transparent portfolio and the brown portfolio based on the models introduced in the previous section. Then, we propose an observable greenness and transparency factor defined as the difference between the returns on the greener and more transparent portfolio and those on the brown portfolio. Finally, we estimate the Greenium, i.e. the risk premium associated to the greenness and transparency factor, using a set of European individual stocks. Our sample spans from January 2006 to August 2018, covering all individual stocks included in the STOXX Europe Total Market Index (TMI) on August 2018.12 The STOXX Europe TMI covers approximately 95% of the free float market capitalization across 17 European countries.13 In principle, we could estimate our model on all 20K European listed firms. However, enlarging the sample would only marginally increase its coverage in terms of market capitalization, while it may jeopardize the results owing to the quality of the information that we would feed into the model. Indeed, the reliability of the data we use for our application crucially depends on the quality of environmental disclosures of European firms. On this matter, the NFRD imposes mandatory disclosures only on larger firms (with more than 500 employees). To be on the safe side, we construct our greenness and transparency factor based on a sample which is more reliable in terms of data quality, insofar as it is based on a market index, and still representative of the market as a whole. We present an application on a much larger sample in Section 6.

As in Fama and French (2008), we exclude financial firms (i.e., companies classified in sectors with NACE code K or L). The final dataset comprises n = 942 stocks. Stock returns and stock market capitalization data are sourced from Bloomberg. The panel is unbalanced, i.e., asset returns are not available for all firms at all dates. To account for publication lags, in each given year we use environmental disclosures for the previous reference year.

# 5.1 Portfolio analysis and the Greenness and Transparency Factor

As described in Section 3, we distinguish between transparent and non-transparent companies. The former belong to set T while the latter belong to set Tc. At each month t, we define the returns on the transparent and non-transparent portfolios, i.e. ˜t and ˜c, respectively, as follows:

rt

˜t = ∑i∈Twiri,t,

˜c = ∑i∈Tcwiri,t,

where the weight is defined as wi = MCi,t/ ∑MCi,t, with MCi,t being the market capitalization of stock i at month t.

Focusing on transparent firms, we study the returns on different portfolios characterized by different shades of green and degrees of transparency. In particular, we build portfolios of returns ˜q corresponding to the quintiles q = 1, ..., 5 of the distribution of the greenness and transparency indicator considering only firms belonging to the set T.

12This allows us to avoid survivor bias in the data.

13These are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The portfolio built on the fifth quintile includes top-ranked firms in terms of environmental performance and disclosures and is labeled ‘greener and more transparent’ portfolio. The returns on this portfolio are indicated as rt ˜g.

Focussing on non-transparent firms, we build the brown portfolio by including companies in Tc which are active in one or more of the industries characterized by the highest emissions, as described in Section 3. The returns on this portfolio are indicated as ˜b. Table 12 in the Appendix reports descriptive statistics for firms included in portfolios characterized by various shades of green and transparency. It shows that the various portfolios are comparable in terms of average size of the companies and firms’ leverage, while firms in the non-transparent and brown portfolio tend to have a slightly better RoA compared to greener and more transparent firms.

# 1. Descriptive Statistics for Returns

Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the returns on various portfolios, namely the one including all transparent firms ˜R, the greener and more transparent portfolio ˜Rg, the portfolio including all non-transparent firms ˜Rc, and the brown portfolio ˜b. With respect to the relative performance of the various types of firms, and looking at the mean return, the non-transparent portfolio has outperformed the others, followed by the brown and the transparent.

A sounder way to assess the performance of a portfolio is the Sharpe ratio, which relates the mean performance to the standard deviation of the returns on a portfolio. In terms of Sharpe ratio, the non-transparent portfolio still outperforms the others, which have a similarly better performance than the market. Neither the mean return nor the Sharpe ratio are monotone in greenness and transparency, which is explained by the fact that the environmental characterization of a portfolio is only one of the determinants of its performance (see below). Finally, the distribution of returns for all the portfolios is characterized by excess kurtosis and negative skewness.

# Table 1: Descriptive Statistics for Returns

Taking a closer look at transparent firms, Table 13 in the Appendix reports descriptive statistics for quintile.

In the asset pricing literature there is no univocal choice on which percentiles of the distribution one should use for the construction of the relevant portfolios. For example, Ang et al. (2006) use quintiles, Baker and Wurgler (2006) use deciles, and Ahern (2013) use terciles. In general, the choice of the relevant percentiles is the result of a trade-off between the need to maximize heterogeneity between the two portfolios, and the need to ensure a large enough portfolio size. In our case, the top decile selects only a small number of stocks (as low as 13 in 2005), while terciles fail to identify the top firms in terms of environmental performance and transparency. Robustness checks using deciles and terciles are presented in Table 11 the Appendix.

Building portfolios based on the percentiles of the distribution of some relevant firm characteristic is standard in the asset pricing literature. It should be emphasized, however, that this is a relative approach to the classification of firms. In particular, a firm may cease to be included in the ‘greenest and more transparent’ portfolio if other firms reduce their emission intensity or improve their environmental disclosures, or if greener and/or more transparent firms are included in the sample, even if its environmental performance and transparency are unchanged in absolute terms.

portfolios 1-5, with portfolio R˜5 being the same as portfolio R˜g , i.e. the top green and transparent portfolio, while portfolio R˜1 includes comparatively higher emitting and less transparent firms, among those that do some environmental disclosure. Also in this case, the average return decreases as the level of the greenness and transparency indicator increases, though not monotonically (see Ciciretti et al., 2019 for a similar result based on an ESG characterization of firms). The same result holds when looking at the Sharpe ratio.

We investigate the drivers of the excess returns for the portfolios described above by considering the reference models described in Section 4. In particular, Table 2 reports the estimated factor loadings for the Cahart model (CAR), the three-factor Fama-French model (3FF), and the CAPM. Results are reported for the various portfolios. Overall, results are in line with the literature with respect to the market, size, value, and momentum factors, indicating that the portfolios we analyze are rather standard with respect to these dimensions. In particular, the estimated factor loading for the market factor bˆm is positive and significant across all models and portfolios. However, for the transparent as well as for the greener and more transparent portfolios, the exposition to the market factor is lower compared to the non-transparent and brown portfolios. This means that more transparent and greener firms tend to be less correlated with the market compared to more opaque and browner firms. The performance of the various portfolios can also be explained by the different loadings on the other factors. In particular, the exposition with respect to the size factor, bˆsmb, enters with a negative sign for the transparent and greener and more transparent portfolios, on the one hand, and a positive sign for the non-transparent and brown portfolios, on the other hand. This suggests that greener and transparent firms correlate more with bigger firms, while non-transparent and brown firms correlate more with smaller firms. Indeed, based on Table 12, firms in the greener and more transparent portfolio exhibit a slightly larger mean size as measured by total assets. As for the value factor ˆhml, the estimated loading is always negative and significant, except for the brown portfolio for which it is negative but non significant. Negative loadings on the value factor might mean that the portfolios include a comparatively larger share of firms with a lower book-to-market value. Considering the Carhart model, the coefficient on the momentum factor is not significant, except for the transparent portfolio. Looking at the explanatory power of the various models with respect to the different portfolios, the adjusted R-squared is lower for the brown portfolio based on all the models. Finally, the intercept is positive and significant for all portfolios and models, suggesting the existence of an omitted factor.

We define the greenness and transparency factor as the difference between the monthly returns on the greener and more transparent portfolio and those of the brown portfolio. Formally:

fg,t = ˜g− ˜.rt rb t

# 5.2 Asset pricing analysis

In this section we investigate whether the greenness and transparency factor defined in Equation (7) affects the cross-section of European stock returns. Further, we test whether investors accept lower (higher) compensation for holding environmentally friendly stocks by searching for a negative (positive) risk premium, i.e. a Greenium. The excess return Ri,t follows the model in Equations (2)-(3). In particular, we consider the same linear factor models used in the previous section, adding the greenness and transparency factor fg among the observable factors as follows:

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649

|Model|Factors|K|
|---|---|---|
|CAR + G|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t, fmom,t, fg,t|5|
|3FF + G|fm,t, fsmb,t, fhml,t, fg,t|4|
|CAPM + G|fm,t, fg,t|2|

The risk premium associated with the greenness and transparency factor is defined as follows:

λg = E[fg,t] + νg . (8)

In order to estimate the risk premia for the observable factors using individual stocks, we follow the estimation procedure proposed in Gagliardini et al. (2016). This procedure allows to deal with unbalanced panels, hence allowing to estimate the model on individual stocks rather than portfolios, and involves the following steps. First, we estimate the linear factor model by using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) estimator. Second, we use the fitted residuals to test whether the model is correctly specified. In particular, we compute the diagnostic criterion proposed in Gagliardini et al. (2019), which checks whether the error terms share at least one unobserved common factor. Based on our sample, the criterion does not detect any common factor for the residuals, suggesting the validity of the factor structure.16 Third, we compute the cross-sectional estimator νk from (3) by Weighted Least Squares (WLS). Finally, the estimate of the risk premium ˆk for each factor is given by the sum of the expected λ return on the factor E[fk,t] and the estimate of ˆk.ν

Table 4 shows the estimated risk premia attached to the factors, including the Greenium, as well as the estimates for νk. Looking at the first two columns of the table, almost all risk premia are significant across the board, and have the expected signs. In particular, the estimated risk premia for the market, size, value and momentum factors are comparable with the results in Gagliardini et al. (2016) and Chaieb et al. (2018). The estimated Greenium is negative and significant at the 1% level in all cases. A negative Greenium indicates that investors accept lower compensation, ceteris paribus, to hold assets that correlate positively with the greenness and transparency factor, i.e. greener and more environmentally transparent assets. The mainstream interpretation of this result is based on the assumption that investors only care about their portfolios’ future payoffs. Hence, if they accept a lower remuneration to hold a certain type of assets, this must be because by doing so they are hedging some risks. In this specific case, holding greener and more transparent stocks constitutes a hedging strategy against climate risk. In the case of more environmentally friendly and transparent stocks, however, other considerations may also play a role. In particular, as suggested by Fama and French (2007), investors decisions may also be driven by some ‘taste for assets’, unrelated to expected returns. In this light, an emerging ‘taste for green’ in the market could also explain our result.

16For example, for the Carhart model plus the greenness and transparency factor, the difference between the largest eigenvalue of the empirical cross-sectional covariance matrix of the residuals ˆi,t and the penalization term is negative, pointing to the absence of ε omitted factors.

The last two columns of Table 4 refer to ˆk. Focussing on the greenness and transparency factor, ˆg is always ν negative and significant at the 1% level for the CAR+G, and at the 5% for the 3FF+G and CAPM+G models. For this component of the risk premium, the literature has proposed an interpretation linked to market imperfections (see, e.g. Daniel and Titman, 1997; Haugen and Baker, 1996). With reference to the Greenium, our hypothesis is that νg could capture alternative preferences of market participants, for example reflecting alternative expectations on future states of the economy (see Black and McMillan, 2006). In other words, some of the information that market participants have may not be fully captured based only on past returns. In this context, the difference between the investors’ larger information set and the smaller, backward-looking information set on which the model is estimated could be reflected in νk. This may be true in particular in the case of green and brown assets, in which case future perspectives may play a comparatively more important role than for other categories of assets.

# 6 Robustness checks

In this section we provide a battery of robustness checks that are summarized in the table below. The exercises are combinations of the following three dimensions: (i) the definition of the greenness and transparency indicator; (ii) the reference sample of individual stocks; and (iii) the definition of the greenness and transparency factor.

|Rob. 4.3|Eq. (9)|n.a.|2,154|f2 g,t|

The first set of exercises (Rob. 1.1 - Rob 2.3) relate to the greenness and transparency indicator as defined in
Equation (1). Rob. 1.1 with γ = 0.5 corresponds to the benchmark specification used in Section 5.2, where we assign
equal weight to the two components of the greenness and transparency indicator, namely the emission intensity and
the environmental transparency of a firm. By tuning the parameter γ, we investigate whether attaching more or less
weight to one of the components of the indicator has an impact on the results. In particular, by imposing γ > 0.5,
we construct an indicator where the quality of a firm’s environmental disclosures has a lower weight compared
to its emission intensity. This version of the indicator attaches a larger weight to hard data and quantitative
information, and a smaller weight to a transparency score which may also rely on descriptive statements and high
level disclosures. Conversely, γ < 0.5 attaches a higher weight to quantitative information and a lower weight to
the overall quality and completeness of environmental disclosures. We also investigate the extreme cases for which
γ = 0 and γ = 1, i.e., the cases for which the indicator Gi,y collapses to the E score Ei,y and to the inverse of the
ranking of emission intensity Ki,y, respectively.

The second set of exercises (Rob. 3.1 - Rob. 4.3) involves a different specification for the greenness and
transparency indicator. In particular, we propose an alternative functional form, where the two components of the
indicator are related to each other in the form of a ratio. In this specification, we use the emission intensity and
the E score as such, while the benchmark specification involves the rankings based on these two indicators. The
alternative definition is thus as follows:

E∗ (Sales)

Gi,y = Ki,y∗ i,y = Ei,y∗

(Emissions)

17

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3452649

where Ei,y is the E score and Ki,y is the ratio of total GHG or CO2 emissions over sales. Unlike the indicator in Equation (1), the indicator based on Equation (9) suffers from a non-linearity issue. In particular, a variation in the denominator corresponds to a more than proportional change in the greenness and transparency indicator. This nonlinearity yields an unstable pattern for the greenness and transparency indicator over time for some companies.

In a further set of robustness checks (Rob.2.1-2.3 and Rob. 4.1-4.3), we expand our sample to include all listed European companies which do some environmental disclosure, i.e. have an E score larger than zero, and those that do no disclosure and belong to brown sectors, as defined in Section 3. By doing so, we more than double the size of the sample, bringing it to 2,154 stocks. However, as discussed in Section 5, enlarging the sample to include mid and small caps may affect the quality of the environmental information used to construct the greenness and transparency indicator. For this reason, in this exercise we still use the greenness and transparency factor as constructed on the smaller, more reliable sample. In particular, the greener and more transparent portfolio and the brown portfolio include the same firms as described in Section 3, hence the factor is the same as in the benchmark exercise described in Section 5. However, this factor is used in Rob.2.1-2.3 and Rob. 4.1-4.3 to price a larger set of assets. Formally, referring to Equation (2), this set of robustness checks involves the same factors ft,k as in the benchmark case, but a larger number of stocks N &gt; n.

Additionally, we check the robustness of the results with respect to the definition of the greenness and transparency factor. In the benchmark case (see Section 5.2) as well as in Rob. 1.1, 2.1, 3.1 and 4.1, we build a portfolio of brown firms selecting the ones belonging to the highest emitting NACE economic sectors, among those that do no environmental disclosure. However, one could argue that the NACE classification is in some cases unsuitable for sustainability analysis. Hence, we build an alternative greenness and transparency factor fg,t based on the returns on the greener and more transparent portfolio ˜g, on the one hand, and those of the portfolio including all non-transparent firms ˜c, on the other. Formally,

fg,t = ˜g − ˜.1 rt rct (10)

Rob 1.2, 2.2, 3.2, and 4.2 perform the estimation of risk premia using the greenness and transparency factor fg,t.

Finally, we test yet another specification for the greenness and transparency factor, only based on transparent firms. In particular, we construct the greenness and transparency factor fg,t as the difference between the returns on the greener and more transparent firms and the firms that do some environmental disclosure, but only attain lower levels of greenness and transparency. The former set of firms correspond to the greener and more transparent portfolio as defined in Section 5, i.e. the one including firms in the top quintile of the distribution of the greenness and transparency indicator. The latter set of firms correspond to those in the lower quintile of the distribution of the greenness and transparency indicator. Formally, the greenness and transparency factor is constructed as

18

Also in this case, we test both specifications of the greenness and transparency indicator on the two samples (see Rob. 1.3, 2.3, 3.3 and 4.3).

# Table 5

Table 5 reports the estimated Greenium ˆg and the estimated coefficient ˆg for Rob. 1.1 - Rob. 2.3. The results are based on a four-factor model including the factors in the Carhart model and the greenness and transparency factor.

Focussing on the Greenium, tuning the parameter γ in the benchmark case (i.e., Rob. 1.1) provides results in line with the evidence presented in the previous section. The Greenium is always negative and significant at the 1% confidence level for γ = 0.2, 0.5 and γ = 0.8. Rob. 1.2 and 1.3 use the alternative definitions of the greenness and transparency factor. Building the factor by considering all nontransparent firms instead of only brown firms (Rob. 1.2) still yields a negative and significant Greenium at the 1% level for γ = 0.5 and γ = 0.8, while it is negative and significant at the 5% level for γ = 0.2. Building the factor by considering only transparent firms (Rob. 1.3) yields a negative and significant Greenium for γ = 0.5 and γ = 0.8, at the 5% and 1% confidence level, respectively. Notice that the variation in the size of the Greenium in Rob. 1.2 and 1.3 compared to Rob. 1.1 is purely mechanical, due to the smaller expected value of f g,t and f g,t compared to E[fg,t].

Looking at the lower part of Table 5, Rob. 2.1 - 2.3 estimate the model on the larger sample of European stocks. Considering the benchmark definition for the factor and with γ = 0.5, the Greenium remains negative and significant at the 10% level. Considering the two alternative definitions for the factor, the Greenium remains negative and significant at the 5% and 10% level for Rob. 2.2 and Rob. 2.3, respectively. Varying γ on this larger sample yield a negative Greenium in some instances, but results are generally less strong in terms of significance. Notably, the specifications based on γ = 1, i.e. using only on emission data, are associated with a non-significant Greenium on the larger sample as well.

Focussing on the columns corresponding to extreme values for γ, i.e. γ = 0 and γ = 1, allows us to grasp the importance of the two components of the greenness and transparency indicator. The Greenium is not, or only mildly, significantly different from zero in most exercises. This indicates that only the combination of emission intensity and disclosure quality is generally priced by the market. In no case an indicator based on emissions only (γ = 1) is associated with a significant risk premium, suggesting that investors do not look at emissions only. At the same time, with γ = 0, i.e. when only the completeness of environmental disclosures matters, the Greenium is still negative and significant at 5% or 10% in half of the exercises. This finding suggests that investors do pay attention to the overall quality of firms’ environmental disclosures, over and above their actual emissions.

As for ν, which is linked to the existence of market frictions, the estimates ˆg based on Rob. 1.1. are in line with the results for the risk premium and the cross-sectional parameter ν corresponding to the greenness and transparency factor. Estimation results for the other observable factors are available upon request. The results for these factors are in line with the ones for the benchmark case described in Section 5.2.

the benchmark case both in terms of sign and significance for γ = 0.2, 0.8, 1 , while ˆg with γ = 0 is not significantly ν different from zero. Looking at the other robustness checks, ˆg remains generally significant. However, estimates ν of ν tend to lose significance more on the larger sample, because the distribution of the factor loadings bˆi for the greenness and transparency factor is characterized by a larger standard deviation on the larger sample, compared to the distribution of the loadings based on the smaller sample.

Finally, Table 6 shows results using the the greenness and transparency indicator defined in Equation (9). The more unstable behavior of this version of the indicator does not affect the results. The Greenium remains negative and highly significant with the benchmark factor fg,t as well as with f g,t and f g,t (Rob 3.1 - 3.3). The Greenium is still negative on the larger sample considering all the three alternatives for the construction of the factor. However, significance is lower in Rob. 4.2 and Rob. 4.3, while the estimate in Rob. 4.1 is not significant.

Overall, the Greenium remains negative and significant across the majority of the several robustness checks. It tends to loses statistical significance mostly in extreme cases, when we only consider one of the two components of the synthetic greenness and transparency indicator.

# 7 Climate stress test on actual holdings

Based on the estimates derived in the previous section, we carry out a climate stress test on actual investors’ equity holdings. We consider the various institutional sectors at the global level, as well as European SIFIs in particular. The aim of a climate stress test is to measure the exposure of investors to climate risk, in a scenario where more stringent sustainability-oriented policies are progressively implemented, with increasing pressure on comparatively more carbon-intensive firms and sectors. In such a scenario, the expected returns on greener stocks increase, as more sustainable firms are able to distribute higher dividends, while the price of brown stocks drops for the same reason. Notably, one of the first areas where policy pressure may increase, and is in fact already increasing in Europe, is that of environmental disclosures. Against this background, firms that have already implemented suitable non-financial accounting procedures and adopted more advanced environmental reporting standards will be better off once the non-financial disclosure regulation becomes more stringent. In other words, the expected return on stocks of more environmentally sustainable and transparent firms conditional to the implementation of sustainability policies increases. Formally, this implies that the return on the greenness and transparency factor in Equation (7), which is positively correlated with returns on greener and more transparent stocks, increases.

We test the resilience of investors to climate risk by borrowing data on equity exposures and the classification of economic sectors into climate-policy-relevant sectors from Battiston et al. (2017). Following the indication provided by the authors as supplementary information in Table 3, we group individual stocks (see Section 5) according to their associated NACE code. In particular, we classify stocks in the following economic sectors: fossil fuels, energy intensive activities, housing, utilities, transport, finance and other. Table 1 in Battiston et al. (2017) provides aggregate holdings into climate-policy-relevant sectors, as of 2015, for the following institutional sectors: Individuals, Governments (GOV), Non-Financial Companies (NFCs), Other Credit Institutions (OCIs), Other Financial Services (OFSs), as well as the institutional financial sectors as defined in the ESA classification, i.e. Banks, Investment Funds (IFs), and Insurance and Pension Funds (IPFs). Battiston et al. (2017) also classify equity holdings of individual financial institutions by climate-policy-relevant sectors, obtaining the share of their portfolio invested into each of these sectors. Based on their data, we focus on European SIFIs, as identified by the Financial Stability Board.

The equity portfolio of an investor j at time t is defined as follows:

rj,t = ∑ωκrκ,t,7

where ωκ corresponds to the equity exposure to the climate-policy-relevant sector κ and rκ,t is the monthly average value weighted portfolio return of sector κ.

For each institutional sector and individual bank j, we compute the marginal expected shortfall (MES) introduced by Acharya et al. (2010). The MES is defined as the expected equity loss conditional on a particular factor.

return taking a loss greater than Γ. In this application we estimate the expected equity loss conditional on the greenness and transparency factor return defined in Equation (7) realizing a gain greater than Γ, i.e. a scenario where greener and more transparent stocks outperform brown stocks by more than a particular threshold. Hence, we can write the MES as follows:

M ESj,t = −E[rj,t| − fg,t < −Γ], (13)

= −E[rj,t|fg,t > Γ]. (14)

We compute the MES considering the following three cases, which are defined in terms of portfolio allocation:

- Baseline Case: the investors’ portfolio allocation is defined as in Equation (12) and reflects the actual allocation of institutional sectors and financial institutions as in Battiston et al. (2017). The portfolio share invested in each of the stocks included in on our sample is derived accordingly.
- Case 1: the investors’ portfolio allocation is defined as rj,t = ∑ωj,1r1,t + ωj,1rt + ∑ωj,κrκ,t, where the exposure to the fossil fuel sector, characterized by the highest emissions, is reduced by 50% compared to the baseline. At the same time, we assume that investments are reallocated to greener and more transparent stocks, defined as the stocks with a positive exposition to the greenness and transparency factor.
- Case 2: the investors’ portfolio allocation is defined as rj,t = ∑ωj,κrκ,t, i.e. only greener and more transparent stocks, as defined above, are included in the portfolio.

In all three cases, the M ESj,t is computed w.r.t. the event fg,t > q0.95, where q0.95 indicates the 95th percentile of the distribution of the greenness and transparency factor. This corresponds to an extreme, but still plausible scenario.

Tables 7 and 8 report MES results for the institutional sectors at the global level and for European SIFIs, respectively. The MES is expressed both as percentage loss and in billions of US dollars. Looking at Table 7, the average MES at the global level in the baseline scenario, i.e. given the actual portfolio allocation in 2015, is estimated to be -1.5%. The very limited variation across institutional sectors and institutions indicates that no one would be immune. A loss of -1.5% on equity portfolios globally corresponds to USD 387 bn. For comparison, this figure is close to the total disbursements under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), through which the US Government purchased or insured troubled assets between 2008 and 2014. Table 7 also shows what would happen should a global portfolio reallocation take place. The figures obtained under Scenario 1 indicate that halving the exposure to carbon-intensive activities would reduce the MES only marginally. Losses would be avoided only under Scenario 2, characterized by a radical portfolio reallocation.

Turning to Table 8, we estimate a loss of -1.6%, with individual banks recording losses of up to -2.2% on their

equity portfolio. An average loss of -1.6% for European SIFIs corresponds to almost USD 7 bn. These figures are admittedly not breathtaking, and one might argue that losses of this magnitude would be unlike to trigger a financial crisis. However, this exercise only focuses on equity exposures, and only on first-round losses. Actually, one should consider that a scenario where greener assets very much outperform brown ones would be rooted into a deep transformation of the economy as a whole. The low-carbon transition, if implemented in a sudden and disorderly manner, would be associated with stranded assets and non-performing loans, on top of losses on the stock market, which would also very much weigh on bank’s profits. In fact, only a comparatively small fraction of the overall exposure of banks to carbon-intensive economic sectors is due to banks’ equity holdings. Moreover, the stress-testing literature has shown that second-round effects, such as contagion dynamics, the devaluation of counterparties’ debt obligations, as well as the price impact of fire sales, may considerably amplify first-round losses. In particular, works based on network models show that second-round losses are comparable in magnitude to first round losses (see Battiston et al. (2017) and references therein). Having said that, our data is not granular enough to estimate the amount of second-round losses that could add up to first-round impacts in a scenario like the one we are considering. Moreover, the MES-based stress-testing tool we propose is specifically targeted to assess climate risk in the equity portfolio. However, it’s worth recalling that the global financial crisis, culminating in trillions of losses in world GDP, was triggered by writedowns on the value of loans and securitized assets due to the US subprime crisis, which for many banks amounted to just few billions.

# 8 Conclusions and further research

Based on European stocks, we provide evidence of the existence of a pricing factor linked to climate risk and find that the Greenium, i.e. the associated risk premium, is negative and highly statistically significant. This is a novel result in the asset pricing literature. We obtain this result because we take greenness and environmental transparency seriously, unlike studies based on publicly traded funds or indices, which often market themselves as greener than they actually are. To attenuate the problem of greenwashing, we construct an index of greenness and environmental transparency at the individual company level, which takes into account both the GHG emission intensity of a company and the quality of its environmental disclosure. Based on this index we identify the greener and more transparent companies, while we select brown companies among those that do no disclosure, and operate in brown sectors. These two portfolios are used to define the greenness and transparency factor. The negative sign attached to the Greenium indicates that investors buy stacks of greener and more transparent firms accepting a ceteris paribus lower return, as a hedging strategy to reduce their exposure to climate risk. Based on a battery of robustness checks, we show that investors take into account both firms’ GHG emissions and the quality of their environmental disclosures.

In the last part of the paper we use our model to price investors’ equity holdings. We find that their current portfolio allocation exposes them to non-negligible losses in a severe but plausible scenario, where greener and more transparent firms outperform brown firms. We estimate that direct losses could amount to 1.5% of the global equity exposure, and to USD 7 bn for European SIFIs overall. By adding up second-round effects and losses on loans and other assets, this figure could rapidly increase. We calculate that halving investors’ exposure to carbon-intensive activities would decrease losses only marginally, while only a radical portfolio reallocation towards greener assets would ensure resilience. Based on our results, and considering that we only focus on equity exposures, we argue in favor of introducing climate stress tests for systemic financial institutions to make sure that climate risk is suitably addressed.

priced. The approach we propose to assess climate risk in equity portfolios is based on a simple and well-known methodology, the marginal expected shortfall, and could easily become part of a broader stress-testing exercise.

Given that the awareness of investors towards climate-related issues has clearly increased in recent years, it would make sense to estimate a model with a time-varying risk premium. As discussed, this presents challenges in terms of estimation, and will be the object of future research. Another interesting avenue relates to the drivers of the Greenium, and in particular to the hypothesis that its negative sign could be driven by an increasing ‘taste for green’ among investors.

# Appendix: Additional tables and figures

Figures 2 and 3 show the time-series of the greenness and transparency indicator Gi,y (top panels) for two representative companies, as well as their ranking in terms of E score and emission intensity over time. The bottom panels plot the firms’ E score over time, as well as their emission intensity. NIBE Industrier AB develops solutions for smart heating and intelligent control in industry and infrastructure. International Airlines Group is the largest airline group globally. The greenness and transparency indicator for the two companies differs by three orders of magnitude. For NIBE Industrier AB, the quality and quantity of disclosures have improved over time, together with a slightly decreasing emission intensity, both resulting in an increasing value for the greenness and transparency indicator over time. International Airlines Group attained an E score in 2011 which was comparable to that of NIBE Industrier AB in 2009. However, International Airlines Group’s disclosures only marginally improved over time, if at all. With respect to emissions, they are obviously incomparably larger for airlines than for many other companies.

# Abstract

This study develops the concept of Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility (Strategic CSR) by meta-analyzing the available empirical evidence on the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP). Using meta-analytic structural equation modeling on effect size data from 344 primary studies, our study documents four empirical mechanisms explaining how CSR positively affects CFP: by 1) enhancing firm reputation, 2) increasing stakeholder reciprocation, 3) mitigating firm risk, and 4) strengthening innovation capacity. We propose these four mechanisms to identify four causally relevant attributes that allow us to conceptually distinguish Strategic CSR from CSR more generally. Our findings indicate that this article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

that the four mechanisms combined explain 20 percent of the CSR-CFP relationship, suggesting that considerable room remains for future empirical research. The development of an empirically informed, causal conceptualization of Strategic CSR responds to a long-heard call for better-specified concepts in empirical CSR research.

Keywords: Concept Formation, Corporate Social Responsibility, Financial Performance, Meta-Analysis, Strategy.

# INTRODUCTION

The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has inspired empirical research in management for almost half a century (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012). Early empirical CSR research initially had the (often only implicit) ambition of showing that the socially beneficial activities denoted by the CSR concept could be strategically justified by their positive performance implications for the firms undertaking them (Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wood & Jones, 1995). Orlitzky and colleagues (2003) synthesized the findings of 52 primary studies on the relationship between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP) produced in these early years. By documenting a small positive association between CSR and CFP, they corroborated that CSR can indeed be justified strategically.

Over the last two decades, however, CSR research has shifted its focus from investigating the CSR-CFP relationship as a whole to identifying the concrete empirical mechanisms through which CSR activities affect firm-level financial outcomes. This shift seems to have been motivated by three reasons. First, the documentation of a small positive relationship between CSR and CFP by Orlitzky and colleagues (2003) obviated the justificatory ambition to show that CSR mattered, thereby making room for the explanatory question of how CSR mattered instead (Barnett, 2007; Wang, Tong, & Takeuchi, 2016).

Second, scholars became increasingly critical of the coarse-grained and over-inclusive approach to conceptualizing CSR, which produced a concept referring to a diverse set of empirical phenomena (Gond & Crane, 2010). As a response, finer-grained research was increasingly undertaken, focusing on specific types of CSR activities and their indirect effect on firm performance (Flammer, 2013; King & Lenox, 2002; Wang & Qian, 2011). Third, CSR research became methodologically more sophisticated as scholars started to use more advanced research designs (Flammer, 2013, 2015; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016), better data (Henisz, Dorobantu, & Nartey, 2014; Lev, Petrovits, & Radhakrishnan, 2010; Zhao & Murrell, 2016), and more rigorous analytical techniques (Cheng, Ioannou, & Serafeim, 2014; Surroca, Tribó, & Waddock, 2010), that required a shift towards more focused research questions (Godfrey, Merril, & Hansen, 2009; Koh, Qian, & Wang, 2014; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016).

As individual CSR-CFP studies became finer-grained and more focused, however, the field as a whole became more fragmented. A diverse and growing body of empirical findings has emerged identifying a wide variety of empirical mechanisms linking CSR to CFP. One of the most persistent conceptual critiques on CSR involved its lack of theoretical foundations (Ullmann, 1985), resulting in a poorly specified construct (Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wood & Jones, 1995) that has highly permeable boundaries (Lockett, Moon, & Visser, 2006). This has led some scholars to claim that CSR hardly meets even the most basic requirements for explanatory concepts in social science (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008). Although several attempts at conceptual clarification were made (Clarkson, 1995; Swanson, 1995; Windsor, 2006), scholars seem to have accepted that CSR is better conceived of as an umbrella term rather than a well-defined theoretical concept (Gond & Crane, 2010). But as empirical research on CSR and on the CSR-CFP relationship continues to proliferate, the absence of a well-defined theoretical concept increasingly hinders the development of the field (Lockett et al.).

al., 2006; McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006; Pfeffer, 1993), since a minimal degree of consensus regarding the defining features of a concept is required for scholars to effectively engage with each other to advance common knowledge (Kuhn, 1962; Suddaby, 2010).

Within the general field of CSR research, we focus specifically on the stream of research investigating the CSR-CFP relationship in order to isolate and develop the concept of “Strategic CSR”. Following Goertz’ (2006) causal approach to explanatory concepts in social science, we develop a three-level conceptual structure of the concept of Strategic CSR in an effort to identify its causally most relevant properties for explaining financial performance differentials between firms.

We review the empirical CSR-CFP literature, and ask three questions about the current state of research. First, what do we currently know about how CSR affects firm financial outcomes? Specifically, what are the most important empirical mechanisms through which the variety of CSR activities investigated in the literature affect CFP? Second, does our current knowledge about how CSR activities affect CFP ‘exhaust’ the overall CSR-CFP relationship, that is, is the relationship between CSR and CFP fully explained (i.e. fully mediated) by the four empirical mechanisms that we identify in this study? Third, based on the findings of this study, what potentially fruitful avenues can we suggest for future research on (Strategic) CSR?

We answer these questions using advanced meta-analytic techniques on the empirical evidence accumulated over five decades of empirical CSR-CFP research. Based on a review of the literature, we identify four theoretical mechanisms for which empirical evidence is sufficiently available. We then use meta-analytical structural equation modeling (MASEM: Bergh, Aguinis, Heavey, Ketchen, Boyd, Su, Lau, & Joo, 2016) on a combined sample of 402,863 firm-year observations retrieved from 344 empirical studies to provide a simultaneous meta-analytic test of the four empirical mechanisms identified.

We seek to make three contributions to the CSR literature. First, we synthesize the growing and increasingly fragmented body of research on the relationship between CSR and CFP. We document four mechanisms through which CSR activities may contribute to the financial bottom line of firms: firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, risk mitigation, and innovation capacity. Second, we rely on these four mechanisms to theoretically develop the concept of Strategic CSR by defining it in terms of its causally most relevant attributes in explaining CFP. By developing an evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR that can be isolated and carved out from the conceptual domain of CSR more generally, we respond to the long-heard call for better-specified concepts in CSR research around which CSR researchers may unite and contribute to the development of a shared paradigm (Gond & Crane, 2010; Jones, 1995; Lockett et al., 2006). Third, our findings serve as a guide for future CSR-CFP research, both in terms of establishing what we already know and in identifying possible avenues for innovative research contributions still to be made.

# THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

The concept of CSR initially developed in the context of a normative debate, as much of the early CSR literature evolved around the normative question whether firms have an obligation to promote social betterment over and above their economic and legal obligations (Carroll, 1999; Frederick, 1994; Matten, Crane, & Chapple, 2003). In this debate, CSR was mostly residually conceptualized as socially valuable firm activities not required by law or shareholder interests (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001), which explains the coarse and over-inclusive meaning that the concept subsequently acquired in the literature (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008). The move to position CSR as a positive explanatory concept emerged from one particular line of argument in this debate; that CSR activities can be strategically justified because, next to promoting socially beneficial outcomes, they will also positively affect CFP.

(Rowley & Berman, 2000; Wood & Jones, 1995). In support of this argument, an entire stream of empirical CSR-CFP research emerged. Since its inception, however, the concept of CSR has met with various critiques. Referred to as a(n) “contestable” (Windsor, 2006, p. 93), “elusive” (Clarkson, 1995, p. 92), and even “epiphenomenal” concept (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008, p. 210), the main concern has always been that CSR is theoretically poorly defined (Rowley & Berman, 2000; Ullmann, 1985; Wood & Jones, 1995) and therefore does not satisfy even the most basic requirements for explanatory concepts in social science.

# A causal approach to conceptualizing Strategic CSR

To carve out and further develop the explanatory concept of Strategic CSR from the conceptual domain denoted by the concept of CSR more generally, we follow Goertz’ (2006) causal approach to concept formation. Arguing that explanatory concepts in social science are essentially constructed from our causal knowledge on how the phenomenon denoted by the concept interacts with other phenomena, Goertz proposes to define explanatory social science concepts in terms of their causally most relevant general attributes. This causal approach is also a positivist approach to concept formation, because the causally most relevant attributes that jointly define a concept can only be identified through empirical research on the mechanisms through which the phenomenon interacts with other phenomena (a process sometimes referred to as ‘nomological validation’ (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955)).

Empirically validated causal propositions that prior research has found to explain social reality are therefore deeply embedded in explanatory social science concepts, and can be used to foster an ever better theoretical understanding of these concepts themselves.

As the bulk of empirical research has used the CSR concept to explain CFP, we are able to develop an understanding of Strategic CSR by identifying those general attributes of CSR that prior research has found to be causally most relevant in explaining CFP. The concept of

# Strategic CSR

Strategic CSR was first coined by Baron (2001), and subsequently developed further by McWilliams and Siegel (2001) and Waldman and colleagues (2006), who explicitly connected it to the strategic management field’s academic objective of explaining firm competitive advantages from observed performance differentials between firms (Nelson, 1991; Rumelt, Schendel, & Teece, 1991). The development of strategic management concepts by inferring them from performance differentials between firms is an established conceptualization strategy in the strategic management literature and has been foundational for some of the field’s core theories and concepts (for example, the resource-based view: Barney, 1991, 2001; Priem & Butler, 2001; and dynamic capabilities: Winter, 2003; Zahra, Sapienza, & Davidsson, 2006).

It is also a useful strategy to conceptually demarcate and carve out Strategic CSR from the empirical domain denoted by the CSR concept more generally, as there may also exist CSR activities that do not enhance CFP (Wright & Ferris, 1997). Our conceptualization strategy to demarcate Strategic CSR from CSR more generally is graphically illustrated by the Venn diagram in Figure 1. The outer rectangle captures the universe of all firm activities. Within this universe, CSR activities are those firm activities that “appear to further some social good” (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001, p. 117). Within the set of CSR activities more generally, there are some CSR activities that positively contribute to firm performance and some that do not. Only the former are part of the empirical domain denoted by the concept of Strategic CSR. We aim to further develop the concept of Strategic CSR by unveiling the mechanisms through which CSR contributes to CFP, and which identify the causally most relevant attributes of Strategic CSR.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

To identify the general attributes of Strategic CSR, we survey five decades of empirical research on the CSR–CFP relationship. While early empirical research investigated the direct relationship between CSR and CFP (Aupperle, Carroll, & Hatfield, 1985; Cochran & Wood, 1984; Mcguire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988), more recent research has documented that the relationship is mediated by other strategically relevant variables (Surroca et al., 2010). By surveying the available research, we seek to uncover the most important mediating mechanisms through which CSR has been found to affect CFP. We focus only on those mechanisms for which sufficient primary studies are available to test the hypotheses developed through our review using MASEM (Bergh et al., 2016). This leads us to identify four empirical mechanisms through which CSR has been found to affect CFP, that is, through: 1) enhanced firm reputation, 2) stakeholder reciprocation, 3) risk mitigation, and 4) improved innovation capacity.

Below, we review the literature on these four mechanisms, and conclude each subsection with articulating a hypothesis that theoretically predicts how CSR affects CFP through this mechanism. We propose that these four mechanisms are conceptually and empirically distinct and identify four different causally relevant general attributes of Strategic CSR. Because our survey suggests that these four mechanisms are the main mechanisms through which CSR has been documented to affect CFP, we also conjecture that they jointly identify the causally relevant general attributes of the Strategic CSR concept exhaustively. We test this conjecture by introducing a fifth hypothesis predicting that the CSR-CFP relationship is fully mediated by these four mechanisms.

# HYPOTHESES/DEVELOPMENT

# The enhanced firm reputation mechanism

One well-researched empirical mechanism through which CSR has been found to affect CFP involves reputation enhancement. This mechanism captures the strategic benefits of CSR that result from stakeholders perceiving the firm as a more attractive partner to do business with (Boyd, Bergh, & Ketchen, 2010; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Turban and Greening (1997) were among the first to demonstrate this effect empirically, showing that a strong CSR rating increases firm attractiveness to prospective employees. Subsequent research corroborated this finding by uncovering that a firm’s involvement in CSR activities signals organizational norms and values, which influences prospective employees’ perceptions of the working conditions at the firm (Backhaus, Stone, & Heiner, 2002; Greening & Turban, 2000), and increases their willingness to be associated with the firm (Jones, Willness, & Madey, 2014).

Firms signal their CSR activities to stakeholders through their advertising or via external “infomediaries” (Carter, 2006; Deephouse & Heugens, 2009; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Schuler & Cording, 2006). A CSR activity for which the effect on reputation is particularly well established, for example, is philanthropic donations (Brammer & Millington, 2005; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Lev et al., 2010; Williams & Barrett, 2000). Such CSR activities are strategically useful because they attract attention and evoke positive attributions by stakeholders (Godfrey, 2005; Groza, Pronschinske, & Walker, 2011). Firms are sometimes criticized for using CSR to convey a positive image without making material changes within the firm (Haack, Schoeneborn, & Wickert, 2012; Marquis & Qian, 2014; Wickert, Scherer, & Spence, 2016). For example, firms may use corporate philanthropy symbolically, to divert attention away from potential misconduct or to buy goodwill after being accused of misconduct (Du, 2015; Koehn & Ueng, 2010).

For the reputation

enhancement mechanism to be enacted, however, all that is required is that CSR activities target a broad audience and are visible to both existing and prospective stakeholders.

stakeholders are more attracted to CSR firms, these firms have access to a larger pool of stakeholders with whom they can develop productive relationships (Greening & Turban, 2000). Research has also shown that CSR reputations may enhance CFP. Because many customers, for example, are more attracted to and derive more satisfaction from purchasing products or services from CSR firms (Luo & Bhattacharya, 2006; Sen & Bhattacharya, 2001), which increases their purchasing intention (Sen, Bhattacharya, & Korschun, 2006), as well as their willingness to pay premium prices (Homburg, Koschate, & Hoyer, 2005; Marín, Rubio, & Ruiz De Maya, 2012). Investors have also been shown to be more attracted to CSR firms. While investment analysts used to give negative investment recommendations for firms with high CSR ratings in the early nineties, they often perceive CSR as a legitimate and even positive signal of a firm’s future profitability today (Ioannou & Serafeim, 2015). Indeed, share prices often increase after the public announcement of CSR initiatives (Arya & Zhang, 2009; Ramchander, Schwebach, & Staking, 2012). We therefore hypothesize:

# Hypothesis 1:

The CSR–CFP relationship is mediated by firm reputation: CSR is positively related to firm reputation, and firm reputation is positively related to CFP.

# The stakeholder reciprocation mechanism

A second mechanism involves stakeholder reciprocation. When firms engage in CSR, they take actions that benefit at least certain stakeholder groups (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Stakeholders reciprocate by endorsing the firm, resulting in more cooperative, productive, and enduring relationships (Bosse, Phillips, & Harrison, 2009; Bosse & Coughlan, 2016; Jones, 1995). In contrast to the reputation enhancement mechanism, for this path to operate.

The adopted CSR activities must specifically benefit the firm’s existing stakeholders, but need not be visible externally.

Stakeholders while also increasing CFP. Employees of CSR firms benefit from practices such as fair pay, a safer work environment, and professional development opportunities (El Research has documented various ways in which CSR activities create value for Akremi, Gond, Swaen, De Roeck, & Igalens, 2018). In turn, they experience greater job satisfaction (De Roeck, El Akremi, & Swaen, 2016), exude higher levels of organizational commitment (Ali, Rehman, Ali, Yousaf, & Zia, 2010; Brammer, Millington, & Rayton, 2007), and engage more in organizational citizenship behaviors (Bode, Singh, & Rogan, 2015; Hansen, Dunford, Boss, Boss, & Angermeier, 2011). Firms profit from such motivated employees, not only because they are more productive, but also because firms can contract with them based on trust, which substantially decreases contracting costs (Jones, 1995).

A firm’s suppliers of financial capital also reciprocate CSR activities. Research has found that high CSR firms tend to engage in elaborate voluntary reporting (Dhaliwal, Li, Tsang, & Yang, 2011), which reduces information asymmetry and agency costs (Cheng et al., 2014). As a result, debtholders, institutional investors, and other equity providers are willing to offer their resources to the firm at more favorable terms (Cheng et al., 2014; Dhaliwal et al., 2011; El Ghoul, Guedhami, Kwok, & Mishra, 2011).

Local communities and government bodies may similarly endorse the firm in CFP-enhancing ways (Frooman, 1999). Governments depend on a public mandate, which incentivizes them to scrutinize the firms in their jurisdictions for how they handle and affect community interests (Doh & Guay, 2006). Higher levels of community endorsement resulting from CSR may thus lead to more favorable regulatory and enforcement conditions for the firm (Campbell, 2007; Sharma & Henriques, 2005) and higher levels of public procurement (Flammer, 2018; den Hond, Rehbein, de Bakker, & Lankveld, 2014). Communities may also...

reciprocate by granting CSR firms a societal license to operate (Henisz et al., 2014; Prno & Slocombe, 2012). For example, firms in extraction industries often sign community benefit agreements, which are contracts between the firm and local communities stating how firms compensate communities for the social and environmental disruptions they will cause (Dorobantu & Odziemkowska, 2017). In the absence of such initiatives, firms may face persistent stakeholder conflicts resulting in a depreciation of intangible assets and investor skepticism (Dorobantu & Odziemkowska, 2017; Henisz et al., 2014). CSR may thus have beneficial effects on a firm’s existing stakeholder relationships, leading to stakeholder reciprocation and higher levels of CFP. Hence:

# Hypothesis 2:

The CSR–CFP relationship is mediated by stakeholder reciprocation: CSR is positively related to stakeholder reciprocation, and stakeholder reciprocation is positively related to CFP.

# The risk mitigation mechanism

CSR firms are involved with a broader set of issues and engage with more diverse stakeholder groups than firms focusing strictly on their core business and operations (Hart & Sharma, 2004). With this broader perspective, firms can access new information that can be used to reduce firm-specific risk. Indeed, a prior meta-analysis has found a negative relationship between CSR and firm risk (Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). More recent research supports this conclusion (Bansal & Clelland, 2004; Lee & Faff, 2009; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009; Oikonomou, Brooks, & Pavelin, 2012), showing that stock price crash risk (Kim, Li, & Li, 2014) and firm default risk (Sun & Cui, 2014; Verwijmeren & Derwall, 2010) are both reduced by CSR activities.

There are two main explanations of how CSR can reduce risk. CSR may directly mitigate risk because many CSR activities are especially designed to avoid harm to

stakeholders. Such activities are for instance, pollution prevention practices, employee health and safety programs, and fair-trade policies. Implementing these initiatives can reduce the firm’s risk exposure. ISO 14001 certification, for example, requires that firms have clear systems in place for monitoring and measuring environmental performance, creating awareness and competence among all employees, and organizing for emergency preparedness and response (Morrow & Rondinelli, 2002).

CSR may also indirectly reduce firm risk. Through CSR, firms can develop closer relationships with their stakeholders, which makes them more willing to share information with these firms (Harrison, Bosse, & Phillips, 2010). CSR can thus prove instrumental for sensing changes or threats, as stakeholders may transmit early-warning signs to managers (Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016). Volkswagen’s emission-scandal, for example, was partly caused by its authoritative corporate culture, which made employees afraid of questioning targets or sharing bad news with their superiors (Cremer & Bergin, 2015). Had Volkswagen fostered open and collaborative relationships with its employees, these problems might have been resolved before materializing into a costly public scandal. Thus, stakeholder relationships enable firms to anticipate and prevent foreseeable risks (Klassen & Vereecke, 2012; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016; Porter & Kramer, 2007).

Lower firm-specific risk creates value not because it directly generates higher CFP, but because it helps to preserve it (Choi & Wang, 2009; Ortiz-de-Mandojana & Bansal, 2016). Being implied in misconduct exposes firms to direct legal expenses such as litigation costs, administrative fines, and criminal sanctions, but also to indirect expenses such as turnover of key personnel, refinancing costs, and forgone sales (Karpoff & Lott, 1993; Koh et al., 2014). Because CSR firms are able to identify threats early on and correct potentially illegal acts, they can prevent these costs (Mcguire et al., 1988; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). In sum, firms that engage in CSR are more risk-aware, allowing them to manage and mitigate these risks.

more effectively. Lower firm-specific risk, in turn, reduces the likelihood that firms incur unproductive costs that burden CFP. Hence:

# Hypothesis 3:

The CSR–CFP relationship is mediated by firm risk: CSR is negatively related to firm risk, and firm risk is negatively related to CFP.

# The improved innovation capacity mechanism

Scholars have long recognized the potential of CSR to be a lever of innovation and competitive differentiation (Husted & Salazar, 2006; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Because firms that engage in CSR tend to adopt a broader perspective and develop closer relationships with stakeholders, they are better able to identify new opportunities (Harrison et al., 2010; Tantalo & Priem, 2016). Close relationships with external stakeholders such as local communities, customers, and environmental groups for example, offer new knowledge pools that can become an important source of innovation (Buysse & Verbeke, 2003; Hart, 1995; Hart & Dowell, 2011). Good relationships with internal stakeholders are also important for innovation. Employees may be more willing to share information with the firm (Aragón-Correa, Martín-Tapia, & Hurtado-Torres, 2013; Harrison et al., 2010), and be better able to overcome the sort of short-term orientation that tends to impede innovation (Flammer & Kacperczyk, 2016; Wang & Bansal, 2012).

Another reason why CSR may enhance the firm’s innovativeness is that the adoption of many CSR activities requires the development of existing innovation capabilities or triggers the creation of new capabilities. The extent of a firm’s absorptive capacity (Delmas, Hoffmann, & Kuss, 2011; Luo & Du, 2015) and presence of complementary assets (Christmann, 2000), for example, facilitate the successful implementation of CSR. Researchers have established that firms adopting proactive environmental strategies tend to engage in higher-order learning and continuous innovation (Sharma & Vredenburg, 1998).

which may result in the development of new dynamic capabilities (Aragón-Correa & Sharma, 2003). Danone, a food products multinational, offers an illustrative example. Since the early 2000s the firm has been launching base of the pyramid projects in rural areas of developing countries. These initiatives were an important source of strategic renewal, as it encouraged experimentation and learning within Danone, and allowed it to develop unique expertise in creating low-cost solutions (Faivre-Tavignot & Dalsace, 2014).

The relationships between innovation, absorptive capacity, and CFP are well established in the strategy literature (Tsai, 2001; Zahra & George, 2002), but there is increasing evidence for the presence of these relationships in the CSR context as well (Delmas et al., 2011; Tang, Hull, & Rothenberg, 2012). Innovations resulting from a firm’s engagement with stakeholders can enhance CFP in at least three ways. First, CSR offers a powerful means of product differentiation (Flammer, 2015b; Hull & Rothenberg, 2008; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Siegel & Vitaliano, 2007). Second, radical process innovations, especially in the context of environmental management, may reduce both waste and production costs (Christmann, 2000; Dixon-Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand & Romi, 2013; King & Lenox, 2002; Klassen & Whybark, 1999). Finally, as illustrated by the Danone example, CSR initiatives may lead to new business models and offer completely new sources of value creation (Hart & Christensen, 2002; Hart & Sharma, 2004). Therefore:

# Hypothesis 4:

The CSR–CFP relationship is mediated by innovation capacity: CSR is positively related to innovation capacity, and innovation capacity is positively related to CFP.

Does our current knowledge allow an exhaustive conceptualization of Strategic CSR? Thus far, we have theoretically unveiled and articulated four broad empirical mechanisms through which prior empirical research has suggested CSR to improve CFP. We propose that

these four mechanisms identify the four causally relevant properties of Strategic CSR. In developing explanatory concepts in social science, it is not only important to incorporate the available knowledge about a phenomenon into its conceptual understanding, but also to establish whether this understanding is more or less complete in terms of accounting for the available empirical evidence. Methodologically, this implies assessing whether the four empirical mechanisms identified thus far fully mediate the relationship between CSR and CFP. If not, the implication is that there is at least one alternative causal path connecting CSR and CFP, which is currently absent from our theorizing. To determine whether the current conceptualization of Strategic CSR is indeed exhaustive, we therefore tentatively hypothesize that the CSR-CFP relationship is fully mediated by the four empirical mechanisms identified above:

# Hypothesis 5:

The CSR-CFP relationship is fully mediated by firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity.

# METHODS

# Sample and coding

We used five search strategies to identify CSR-CFP studies. First, we read review articles (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; McWilliams et al., 2006) and prior meta-analyses (Margolis, Elfenbein, & Walsh, 2007; Orlitzky, 2015). Second, we examined six electronic databases: (1) ABI/INFORM Global, (2) Business Source Premier, (3) JSTOR, (4) Google Scholar, (5) ECONLIT, and (6) SSRN, using search terms such as: ‘corporate social responsibility’, ‘corporate social performance’, ‘ethical investment’, and ‘green investment fund.’ Third, we manually searched 15 leading journals in management and finance, including: Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Corporate Finance, Journal of Management Studies, and Strategic Management Journal. Fourth, we emailed all researchers who had written empirical studies.

papers on CSR and CFP with missing effect-size information, asking them for a correlation table and any studies we could not retrieve by other means. Finally, using a two-way ‘snowballing’ technique, we backward-traced all references reported in the identified articles and forward-traced all articles that cited the original articles via Google Scholar. These five search strategies yielded a final sample of 344 primary studies. Of these, 296 were published journal articles and 48 were working papers at the time of our analysis. The publication window ranged from 1978 to 2016.

We then developed a coding protocol (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) for extracting effect size and sample size information for all the variables in our study, including dependent, independent, mediator, and control variables. One author coded all effect sizes. To assess inter-rater agreement, a second rater coded a subsample of 200 randomly selected effect sizes, after which we computed a chance agreement-corrected measure of inter-rater reliability (Cohen’s kappa coefficient; Cohen, 1960). With a value of 0.90, kappa signified high inter-rater agreement (cf. Van Essen, Otten, & Carberry, 2015; Klier, Schwens, Zapkau, & Dikova, 2017).

# Measurement

Table 1 provides a description of all our variables. Existing studies have used many different measures for CSR, including both composite indices and single-item measures such as emission reductions (e.g. King & Lenox, 2002) or philanthropic donations (e.g. Zhang, Rezaee, & Zhu, 2010). We included all CSR measures in our study. CFP is operationalized using accounting-based measures such as Return on Equity (ROE) or Return on Assets (ROA), or market-based measures such as Tobin’s Q or market-to-book ratio. To measure firm reputation we included both third-party assessments such as expert ratings and firm expenditures on reputation building (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Stakeholder reciprocation has not been measured before.

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

In primary studies, so we constructed this measure by capturing any manifestation of positive reciprocal behavior by stakeholders (Bosse & Phillips, 2016), such as employee commitment, customer satisfaction, and the involvement of government, institutional, or inside investors in the firm’s ownership structure. Firm risk was typically measured as variability in financial performance (e.g. Jensen’s beta or the standard deviation of stock returns). To capture innovation capacity we used both generic measures, such as the fraction of R&D expenses over sales, as well as more CSR-specific ones, such as the degree of environmental innovativeness.

We include several control variables in our analysis. We include prior CFP, since research has shown that this variable affects CSR through the mechanism of organizational slack, as well as current CFP through momentum effects (Waddock & Graves, 1997). We control for firm size, as larger firms tend to be more prone to invest in CSR and profit from it because of the economies of scale involved in the acquisition and deployment of CSR-related resources (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). We include firm leverage because prior CSR research has shown that resource availability is an important predictor of firms’ ability to profit from CSR (Brammer & Millington, 2008). Finally, we control for capital intensity, as prior research has suggested that incorporating CSR initiatives can be more difficult and more costly to implement in capital-intensive industries (Surroca et al., 2010). All variable operationalizations are listed in Table 1.

A common problem in meta-analysis is that the measures used in primary studies tend to involve measurement error. In our case, especially the constructs firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, and innovation capacity are often measured through self-report surveys (Boyd, Gove, & Hitt, 2005), which are often not corroborated with archival measurements (Bergh et al., 2016). Following best-practice recommendations (Bergh et al.,

2016), we deal with measurement error by applying a conservative 0.80 measurement reliability standard to all hypothesized mediator variables.

# Meta-analytic procedure

We used Hunter and Schmidt (2004) meta-analysis (HSMA) to compute the meta-analytic mean association between CSR and CFP, standard deviations, percentage of variance due to sampling error, and 95 percent confidence intervals around mean correlations (Whitener, 1990). Since our constructs of interest are usually reported as a continuum, we provide correlations rather than standardized differences (d) (O’Boyle, Pollack, & Rutherford, 2012). HSMA “allows for the correction of statistical artifact and thus provides a relatively accurate estimate of the true average strength and variance of the relationship in the population of interest” (Geyskens, Steenkamp, & Kumar, 2006, p. 526). Compared to Hedges and Olkin meta-analysis (HOMA; Hedges & Olkin, 1985), which only corrects for sampling error, HSMA corrects for a broader array of statistical artifacts, including measurement error, dichotomization, and range restrictions (Heugens, Van Essen, & Van Oosterhout, 2009), making it a more appropriate choice for estimating mean effect sizes including subjective measures (Kepes, McDaniel, Brannick, & Banks, 2013). The HSMA method involves (1) estimating the population mean correlation and variability, (2) correcting for the statistical artifacts of sampling and measurement error, and (3) evaluating the existence and impact of moderators (Judge, McNatt, & Xu, 2011). We performed sub-group analyses to assess whether c was sensitive to: (a) the source of the CSR data (survey, archival, or third-party evaluations); (b) the stakeholder group targeted by the CSR activities (employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, community, natural environment, or mixed stakeholders); (c) the CFP measures used (accounting- or market-based); and (d) industry (manufacturing, financial services, non-financial services, or mixed industries).

This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

We used both Pearson product-moment correlations (r) and partial correlations (rxy.z) derived from primary studies to compute c and the corresponding confidence interval.

A partial correlation is a standardized measure of the degree of association between two variables (x and y), controlling for the influence of a vector of other factors (z). We obtained the partial correlations from primary studies by converting reported t-statistics using the relevant formulas.iv rxy.z-based HSMAs generate useful additional information because they measure the direct impact of CSR on CFP, holding other factors constant (Doucouliagos & Ulubaşoğlu, 2008). By using rxy.z, we can also compare the mean effect size of the group of primary studies using endogeneity corrections, such as instrumental variables, with that of the group of studies that does not.

When multiple measurements for the same relationship were reported, we included all of them. Monte Carlo simulations have shown that procedures using all reported measurements outperform those that represent each study by a single value in areas such as parameter significance testing and parameter estimation accuracy (Bijmolt & Pieters, 2001).

To test whether this nested research design was causing distortions in our results, we conducted a Hierarchical Linear Modeling Meta-Analysis (HiLMMA; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). The HiLMMA results indicate that 30 percent of the variance in the effect size distribution resides at the within-study level. After correcting for this component, the mean effect size for the CSR-CFP relationship (i.e., the intercept of the HiLMMA model) is 0.08, which is nearly identical to the uncorrected HSMA mean effect size (0.07; see Table 2). Hence, all effect sizes reported in primary studies can safely be included in our analyses.

# MASEM Procedure

We used meta-analytical structural equation modeling (MASEM; Bergh et al., 2016; Carney, Gedajlovic, Heugens, Van Essen, & Van Oosterhout, 2011) to test our hypotheses. MASEM

combines the techniques of structural equation modeling with those of meta-analysis (Cheung & Chan, 2005). This technique allows us to analyze: (a) the direct effect of CSR on CFP, (b) the effect of CSR on firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity, and (c) the consequences of these mediating variables for CFP (Baron & Kenny, 1986). MASEM has two advantages over conventional meta-analytic techniques. First, not all specified relationships need to be included in each primary study, as each cell represents an independent accumulation of primary studies (Carney et al., 2011). Second, MASEM allows for the testing of research hypotheses that have never been tested in prior research, especially those connecting previously unlinked streams of literature (Bergh et al., 2016).

MASEM involves a two-stage procedure (Bergh et al., 2016). First, a series of separate r-based HSMA analyses are conducted to construct a meta-analytic correlation table specifying the mean correlations between all independent, mediator, dependent, and control variables. This table is based on bivariate correlations, as partial correlations usually cannot be computed between the independent and control variables included in each primary research study. To deal with sample size differences, we based our analysis on the harmonic mean sample size (N = 3,704). The harmonic mean is less sensitive to outliers than the arithmetic mean, making it more appropriate for estimating correct and conservative t-values (Geyskens et al., 2006).

In the second stage, the meta-analytic correlation matrix is treated as the observed correlation matrix and subjected to structural equation modeling routines (Cheung & Chan, 2005). The data were analyzed using the full information maximum likelihood method with the LISREL 8.80 software package. To investigate whether a direct and significant relationship between CSR and CFP exists, and whether this relationship is mediated by our hypothesized variables, we estimated six nested models. We commenced with a model examining the direct relationship between CSR and CFP while controlling for prior firm.

# RESULTS

# Descriptive results: The conceptual structure of Strategic CSR

Following Goertz’ (2006) approach to concept formation, we present in Figure 2 the three-level conceptual structure of Strategic CSR. The concept “Strategic CSR” features at the basic level, at which theoretical propositions are developed such as propositions about the causes and consequences of strategic CSR. At the secondary level, Strategic CSR is intensionally defined in terms of its causally most relevant properties, which in our case are identified by the four empirical mechanisms mediating between CSR and CFP: reputation enhancement, stakeholder reciprocation, risk mitigation, and innovation capacity. At the third, or indicator level of the conceptual structure, we extensionally define Strategic CSR in terms of observable empirical phenomena that operationalize the causally relevant properties by which Strategic CSR is defined. For each causally relevant property, we list three illustrative indicators (i.e. examples of CSR activities) that in our view are most likely to trigger this mechanism.

The reputation enhancing property of Strategic CSR, for example, captures visible and symbolically-laden CSR activities that may trigger positive attributions from existing and prospective stakeholders. Examples include affiliation with the United Nation’s Global Compact, announcing donations to charities, and voluntary CSR reporting.

# Reciprocation Property of Strategic CSR

Reciprocation property of Strategic CSR denotes CSR activities that make a substantive contribution to the betterment of the firm’s existing stakeholders. Examples are adopting minority employment policies or family friendly HR practices and signing community benefit agreements. The risk mitigation property of Strategic CSR may involve incremental improvements in practices and processes such as waste reduction and pollution prevention, as well as the adoption of employee health and safety programs. Innovation capacity, finally, captures more comprehensive and transformative CSR initiatives. Potential indicators are public-private partnerships, investments in renewable energy, and base of the pyramid projects.

# Hunter-Schmidt Meta-Analysis Results

Table 2 presents the results for our r-based (left-hand panel) and rxy.z-based (right-hand panel) HSMA analyses pertaining to the CSR-CFP relationship. In addition to the meta-analytic corrected mean effect size (c), we report the number of samples (k), the cumulative sample size (N), the sampling error variation, the sample correlation variance, the estimated variance in population correlation, the 95 percent confidence interval around the (CI c 95%), as well as the p-value based on tests. The for the focal relationship is 0.07 (k = 1,466) and the rxy.z-based mean is 0.03 (k = 1,516). These means are somewhat smaller than those reported in prior meta-analyses (Margolis et al., 2007: 0.13; Orlitzky et al., 2003: 0.18).

In part, this is due to the fact that our study relies less on self-report data than earlier work (9% vs. 35% for Orlitzky et al., 2003). This has a deflationary effect, since self-report studies usually show larger effect sizes. Yet there is also an independent time effect at play. Even when measured objectively, the effect of CSR on CFP wanes over time (is 0.14 for studies published before 1998, but only 0.03 for studies published later), suggesting that the...

widespread diffusion of CSR practices over the last two decades may undercut some of its value as a strategic differentiating factor.

survey data are higher (r-based mean = 0.13; rxy.z-based mean = 0.10). Because few effect sizes are based on archival and third-party rater data are close to the overall, those based on sub-group HSMA analyses reveal the presence of methodological artifacts: whereas the sizes are based on survey data (12.7% of the r-based effect size distribution and 7.4% of the rxy.z-based distribution), removing these effects has no material consequences. When we break down our results by individual stakeholder groups, we find a few effects that are statistically significant but none that seem materially important. Like Orlitzky and associates (2003), we find CSR to be (somewhat) more strongly linked to accounting-based measures of performance than to market-based measures in the r-based distribution (r-based mean = 0.07 vs. 0.06). But in the rxy.z-based distribution we found CSR to be more linked to market-based measures of performance than to accounting-based measures (rxy.z-based mean = 0.04 vs. 0.03). Finally, we found limited evidence for moderation by industry context, with the exception of the financial service industry in the r-based distribution (r-based mean = 0.23).

# MASEM results and hypothesis tests

Table 3 contains the meta-analytic correlation matrix. Each of the 45 cells below the diagonal reports the results of a separate HSMA analysis for each bivariate relationship. We report both the observed correlation and the 95 percent confidence interval, total number of observations (N), as well as the total number of samples (k) on which the meta-analytic mean is based. Since no primary sample included all correlations included in our model, the total number of samples far exceeds the number of samples in any single cell.

# Results

Table 4 contains the results pertaining to our Hypotheses 1 through 5. Figure 3 visually presents these same results. The model fits the data well (χ2 = 122.25; RMSR = 0.024; GFI = 0.99).

# Hypothesis 1

Hypothesis 1 is supported. CSR is positively related to firm reputation (β = 0.10, p < 0.05), and firm reputation is positively related to CFP (β = 0.05, p < 0.05). The total indirect effect of CSR that is channeled through firm reputation is 0.005 (p < 0.05). A formal test for statistical mediation corroborates these findings (Sobel: z = 2.65, p < 0.01).

# Hypothesis 2

Hypothesis 2 receives marginal empirical support. CSR is positively related to stakeholder reciprocation (β = 0.04, p < 0.05), which in turn has a positive effect on CFP (β = 0.05, p < 0.05), but the Sobel test is only borderline significant (z = 1.77, p < 0.10) and the total indirect effect of CSR that flows through stakeholder reciprocation amounts to only 0.002 (p < 0.05).

# Hypothesis 3

Hypothesis 3 is supported. CSR is negatively related to firm risk (β = -0.04, p < 0.05), and firm risk is negatively related to CFP (β = -0.09, p < 0.05). The total indirect effect of CSR that is channeled through firm risk is 0.004 (p < 0.05) and the Sobel test is significant (z = 2.08, p < 0.05).

# Hypothesis 4

We also found support for Hypothesis 4. CSR has a positive and significant effect on innovation capacity (β = 0.07, p < 0.05), and innovation capacity positively affects CFP (β = 0.05, p < 0.05). The total indirect effect of CSR that flows through innovation capacity is 0.004 (p < 0.05) and the Sobel test is significant (z = 2.53, p < 0.05).

# Hypothesis 5

Hypothesis 5 is rejected, however. On the one hand, the Sobel test confirms that the relationship between CSR and CFP is significantly channeled through the four hypothesized pathways (z = 4.51, p < 0.001), with the total indirect effect amounting to 0.01 (p < 0.01). On the other hand, firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity only partially mediate the relationship between CSR and CFP, as the focal effect remains significant (β = 0.06, p < 0.05) upon their inclusion. Specifically, inspection of the path coefficients for the indirect effects suggests that the four hypothesized mediators combined explain 20.0 percent.

of CSR-CFP relationship. This suggests that there may be alternative causal paths connecting CSR to CFP.

# Additional analyses

We performed several additional analyses to address a number of problems that commonly affect meta-analyses. The first of these is the ‘file drawer’ problem, or the underrepresentation of studies reporting weak effects due to publication bias. To address it, we crafted r- and rxy.z- based funnel plots of effect and sample sizes (see Figures 4a and 4b). These figures show a symmetrical pattern with nearly half of the samples to the left of the mean effect size and half to the right; thus suggesting the absence of publication bias (Duval, 2005). We also used the triangulation method to detect the possible presence of publication bias in the CSR-CFP relationship (Harrison, Banks, Pollack, O’Boyle, & Short, 2017). This method involves three complementary tests to detect potential differences between the retrieved HSMA mean effect size and a publication bias-adjusted mean effect size estimate: (a) Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill (Duval, 2005), (b) cumulative meta-analysis (CMA), and (c) moderate selection models (Harrison et al., 2017). The results of these tests suggest the absence of publication bias in our meta-analysis.

A second common problem is undetected measurement error in the underlying primary studies. We already applied a 0.80 level of reliability to all our mediating variables in the main results (see Tables 3 and 4). As an additional robustness check, we re-ran our models using the 0.80 level of reliability for all constructs (Bergh et al., 2016). The findings of this more conservative analysis are consistent with those presented in Table 4.

A third common problem in meta-analyses of literatures based on archival data is overlapping primary samples. We therefore ran a robustness check in which we deleted effect sizes stemming from similar sources (e.g. Fortune 500 firms) with comparable median.

sampling years. This resulted in the removal of 39 r-based studies and 16 rxy.z-based studies. Our results were not materially affected by the removal of these overlapping samples.

self-report studies tend to report larger effect sizes, possibly due to social desirability and self-aggrandizing biases. We therefore ran a separate MASEM analysis on effects derived from studies reporting objective data. Our results were identical to those of the original analysis.

A fourth issue hampering meta-analyses that also partially include survey data is that they tend to be based largely on cross-sectional studies lacking appropriately lagged variables, which might violate the implicit assumption of temporal sequentiality underlying path analysis. In our sample, 40 percent of all studies are in fact based on longitudinal designs. As an additional robustness check, we therefore re-ran our hypothesized model on the subset of effect sizes derived from this set of studies. The results rejected the mediation effect of firm reputation (Hypothesis 1), possibly due to statistical power attrition, but confirmed Hypothesis 2, 3 and 4.

A sixth issue, again specific to MASEM studies, is that the theorized model may not be the model that empirically fits the data best. To account for this possibility, we tested two alternatively specified models (cf. Bergh et al., 2016). In a first alternative model, we related (a) CSR to reputation enhancement and stakeholder reciprocation; (b) reputation enhancement to CFP; and (c) stakeholder reciprocation to CFP via firm risk and innovation capacity. In a second alternative model, we related (a) CSR to firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity; (b) firm reputation to firm risk and innovation capacity; and (c) stakeholder reciprocation to firm risk and innovation capacity, and (d) firm reputation, stakeholder reciprocation, firm risk, and innovation capacity to CFP.

We found the theorized model to show better performance on 10 out of 14 commonly used model fit indicators.

Occasionally affect the reliability and validity of meta-analytic findings. The results of all robustness tests are available in an online appendix. In sum, we conclude that our results are largely robust against a number of issues that.

# DISCUSSION

After reviewing almost half a century of empirical research on the CSR-CFP relationship, we have developed hypotheses on the causally most relevant empirical mechanisms through which CSR has been found to positively affect CFP. We subsequently used MASEM to test these hypotheses on the accumulated empirical evidence. As such, we aim to make several contributions to the literature.

First, our study offers a new synthesis of the available evidence that includes the last two decades of CSR-CFP research. In the fifteen years since the publication of the last two meta-analyses on the relationship between CSR and CFP (Margolis & Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky et al., 2003), the field of empirical CSR research has grown significantly as evidenced by the fact that our analysis counts no less than 224 new papers. During this period, the focus has shifted from empirically assessing the CSR-CFP relationship as a whole to examining the more concrete empirical mechanisms underlying it. Given this development, an up to date assessment of the accumulated empirical evidence is timely and useful. Next to identifying and testing four key mechanisms through which CSR activities affect CFP, our meta-analysis also found that these mechanisms do not fully mediate the CSR-CFP relationship. This implies that there is still room for future research to identify empirical mechanisms causally connecting CSR with CFP that have gone unobserved to date. We return to this below.

A second contribution of our study is that we respond to calls for more conceptual clarification of CSR (Gond & Crane, 2010; Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008; Rowley & Berman, 2000). By focusing on the empirical relationship that has received most scholarly attention to date (Margolis & Walsh, 2003), we were able to distinguish and conceptually carve out Strategic CSR from CSR more generally, and provide a definition of Strategic CSR that is both intensionally and extensionally explicit (Van Oosterhout, 2005). Specifically, we define Strategic CSR as those firm activities that appear to further some social good, while at the same time benefitting the firm financially by either enhancing its reputation, increasing stakeholder reciprocation, mitigating firm-specific risk, and/or improving innovation.

With this evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR, we address an important conceptual problem that has burdened much of the CSR literature to date. By positioning a firm’s economic responsibilities as one of a larger set of social responsibilities that comprise CSR (Carroll, 1979), a central critique of the CSR concept has always been that it confounds two fundamentally conflicting views: that of positive economics and normative ethics (Gond & Crane, 2010; Jones, 1983; Swanson, 1995; Windsor, 2006). Some scholars have indeed argued that CSR is a normative concept (Matten et al., 2003) that has little positive explanatory value (Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008). In this study, we have conceptually developed the Strategic CSR concept that can be used for positive research in strategic management, however. This concept only bears on CSR activities that enhance CFP, making Strategic CSR a purely instrumental form of CSR. By excluding those CSR activities that may be good for society but not for the firm, we have sought to conceptually separate some of CSR’s main positive explanatory features from the normative beliefs as to what CSR ought to comprise. By disentangling the normative and positive features of CSR in this way, we hope to provide some relief to a field that has consistently confused normative and positive.

# Discussion

On what Strategic CSR is, is now completed, nor that all issues on what CSR should be taken to mean more generally have now been resolved. With respect to the former, the development of a conceptualization of Strategic CSR does not mean that it should be clear that future empirical research may still lead to further evidence-based adjustments of the Strategic CSR concept, as would be true in general for all causal approaches to explanatory concept formation. With respect to the latter, our study has conceptually clarified Strategic CSR by carving it out of the domain denoted by CSR more generally, but only at the price of leaving that domain as conceptually opaque as it was (claimed to be) before. Both observations may help to guide future research on CSR.

# Limitations and Future Research

A third contribution of this study, therefore, is that its findings and limitations offer guidance to future research. A salient finding of our study is that the four mechanisms combined explain only 20 percent of the CSR-CFP relationship. These mechanisms therefore do not fully mediate the relationship between CSR and CFP, suggesting that our conceptualization of Strategic CSR does not yet fully account for the mechanisms connecting CSR to CFP. One explanation for this may be that research to date has not yet captured the full breadth and depth of each of the four mechanisms identified. With respect to stakeholder reciprocation, for example, we found studies on employee, government, customer, and shareholder reciprocation, but hardly any studies on community reciprocation (but see: Dorobantu & Odziemkowska, 2017), and none on supplier reciprocation. Similarly, the benefits of stakeholder reciprocation may become manifest in different guises, including retention, word of mouth, and commitment, which all require further empirical measurement.

investigation (Bosse & Coughlan, 2016). As more empirical research fleshing out these four mechanisms accumulates, however, we expect the explanatory power of each of these mechanisms to strengthen further.

research has not yet unveiled all empirical mechanisms through which CSR may contribute to CFP. There may be other mechanisms at play than the four that we identified in this study, implying that our definition of Strategic CSR may need to be expanded and adjusted. As observed above, this is consistent with a causal approach to explanatory concepts in social science, in which new empirical knowledge about a phenomenon may require adjustments or expansions in its conceptual definition (Goertz, 2006).

Using meta-analysis to investigate our research question is one of the strengths of our paper, but it also has limitations. While our conceptualization of Strategic CSR assumes that the empirical mechanisms that we document involve causal relationships, meta-analysis is not the best method for identifying causality in empirical research. Rather, meta-analysis is more suited for investigating which theoretical views about causal relationships are supported by a preponderance of the available evidence. The growing and increasingly fragmented nature of existing CSR-CFP research makes such an assessment of the literature imperative. By identifying the four causally most relevant empirical mechanisms underlying the CSR-CFP relationship, our study may therefore constitute a counter-force to further fragmentation of the field, and provide guidance to researchers seeking to address ever finer-grained research questions in order to identify causality through their research designs.

A related limitation of meta-analysis is that the effect sizes that can be included as data depend on their availability in primary studies. Because available empirical research on the CSR-CFP relationship is highly diverse, we were able to incorporate many effect sizes and empirically test finer-grained models than have been meta-analytically tested to date.

we could not address any questions for which effect sizes were not or insufficiently available in primary studies. This problem is most pressing with respect to the measurement of CSR itself, which prior research has often operationalized by using overly inclusive indicators that lump together many different phenomena (Chatterji, Durand, Levine, & Touboul, 2016; Gond & Crane, 2010; Van Oosterhout & Heugens, 2008; Rowley & Berman, 2000). If anything, we urge researchers to use more specific measurements of Strategic CSR, derived from the empirical mechanisms that are or have been investigated (or, to say the same in other words: to adopt level 3 indicators that derive from secondary level mechanisms, as illustrated in Figure 2).

Finally, we acknowledge that our study offers conceptual clarification on the part of the CSR concept that has strategic value for the firm. As a result, our study says very little about CSR that does not benefit the firm financially. Some scholars have explicitly argued that managers should only engage in CSR if it simultaneously advances the bottom line (Jensen, 2002; Waldman & Siegel, 2008). We do not agree, however, that all CSR is or ought to be strategic. Some CSR activities may have a neutral or insignificant impact on CFP, while others may have a significant negative effect, at least in the short to medium term (Wright & Ferris, 1997). Our meta-analysis did not touch upon the non-strategic side of the CSR concept as this has mostly been a blind spot to CSR scholars.

To understand and conceptualize non-strategic CSR, empirical research is needed that explores when and why managers sometimes pursue CSR activities that are not directly financially beneficial to the firm. Do such activities only serve managerial self-interests (Jensen, 2002; Waldman & Siegel, 2008), or are managers driven by more altruistic motives (Husted & Salazar, 2006)? Moreover, under what conditions do a firm’s stakeholders, especially its shareholders, accept non-strategic forms of CSR? This will likely depend on the consequences of non-strategic CSR, not only for the firm, but also for society. The literature currently defines CSR as all.

firm activities that appear to further some social good (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001), but

CSR scholarship has mostly ignored the empirical question of whether CSR actually creates

value for its intended beneficiaries or not (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). As the value of CSR

should not be evaluated on the basis of its strategic benefits for the firm alone, we hope that

the next of wave of CSR research will focus more on empirically investigating the field-

defining assumption that CSR furthers some form of social good and thereby increase our

understanding of non-strategic forms of CSR.

# NOTES

Overall, the causal approach to concept formation that we subscribe to therefore relies on a functionalist rather than essentialist understanding of concepts. In this functionalist view, concepts are understood in terms of what they do (e.g. how they explain reality) instead of what is assumed about the nature of reality that the concept refers to (e.g. what that part of reality is essentially like even if there exists no feasible way of ever truly knowing what it is like). In this view, which Goertz (2005) develops for social science concepts, our conceptual understanding of a phenomenon therefore evolves with our empirical understanding of how the phenomenon denoted by the concept interacts with other phenomena.

One might object, as an anonymous reviewer did, that ‘hardwiring’ causal knowledge on the consequences of CSR into the conceptualization of strategic CSR would frustrate these causal claims from empirically being tested. This is a legitimate concern for empirical research indeed, as has previously been explained in the literature (Mackenzie, 2003; Mackenzie, Podsakoff, & Podsakoff, 2011) and which has also been acknowledged by Goertz (2006, p. 65–67). For three reasons, however, we do not believe this concern to burden our evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR, however. First, as we have indicated in the body of the text, developing strategic concepts by inferring them from performance differentials between firms is well-established in the field of strategic management, given its field-defining objective of explaining firm competitive advantages from observed performance differentials between firms. In any academic field, however, an important part of conceptually understanding a phenomenon will result from making sense of how the phenomenon causally influences other phenomena.

Second, as the main aim of this study is to develop the concept of strategic CSR based on the body of causal knowledge and empirical evidence already available at this time, we are not overly worried about these claims being precluded from empirical testing. Not only do we provide a comprehensive meta-analytic test of all the mechanisms that we use to identify the causally most relevant properties of CSR in explaining CFP, but all causal claims involved in our conceptualization of Strategic CSR are open to later empirical scrutiny should there be substantive or methodological reasons for empirically testing these claims further.

Finally, Goertz (2006, p. 65–67) acknowledges that hardwiring causal knowledge into our theoretical conceptualization of social reality may not only increase our theoretical understanding of social reality, but may also be problematic precisely because conceptual knowledge is assumed rather than tested in any particular empirical research project. He proposes a pragmatic approach to this problem, however, by arguing that hardwiring available causal knowledge into our conceptualizations should be avoided as much as possible when conceptualizing the explandum (or dependent variable) in research. This is because in explaining a phenomenon,

one should strive to make all explanations of this phenomenon as explicit as possible, in order to be able to empirically assess and test all of them separately and against each other. These concerns are mitigated, however, when conceptualizing the explanans (or explanatory variable) in research, because in that case we would be wise to use all currently available causal knowledge in our concepts and theories in order to develop and test novel theories and predictions. Note that our evidence-based conceptualization of Strategic CSR treats it as an explanans in explaining CFP, while we do not make any explanatory claim in this study about Strategic CSR as an explanandum. In sum, we believe our strategy to conceptualize Strategic CSR based on available knowledge of how it causally affects CFP not only increases our theoretical understanding of Strategic CSR, but also our understanding of how Strategic CSR differs from CSR more generally.

iii A complete overview of the included studies in our meta-analysis can be offered upon request.

iv The partial correlation coefficients were calculated by using the t-statistic reported in the primary studies. If the t-statistic was not reported, we approximated it using the regression coefficient and the standard errors. The formula used to calculate partial correlation is: (t2 / (t2 + df)), where t is the t-statistic and df is degrees of freedom. Note that this will always produce a positive number, so it is necessary to convert it to a negative number if the regression coefficient is negative (Greene, 2008).

v As a separate robustness check, we also ran our MASEM analyses again without the survey data-based effect sizes. All our findings are robust against this exclusion.

vi For the Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill method, we used the left-of-mean (L) estimator (Kepes, Banks, McDaniel & Whetzel, 2012). We then calculated the absolute change in expected direction from the Hunter and Schmidt mean effect size to the left of the trim and fill-adjusted observed mean effect size (Harrison et al., 2017). For the CMA, we calculated the weighted mean correlation of the 10 percent most precise (i.e., largest samples) in our meta-analysis (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009; Harrison et al., 2017). Again, we calculated the absolute change in expected direction from the Hunter and Schmidt mean effect size, but now to the most precise 10 percent of samples (Harrison et al., 2017). For the moderate selection model, we followed the Hedges and Vevea (2005) technique, since several of our meta-analytic relationships present a k lower than 100. We identified the specific weights and probability value cut-off points for our sample based on Vevea and Woods (2005). The absolute change in expected direction from the Hunter and Schmidt mean effect size was calculated to the moderate selection model adjusted mean effect size (Harrison et al., 2017).

absolute change in expected direction from the Hunter and Schmidt mean effect size to: (a) the trim and fill adjusted observed mean effect size, (b) the most precise 10 percent of samples (CMA), and (c) the moderate selection model. We then calculated the average degree of change across these three publication bias tests (Harrison et al., 2017), which was equal to 0.01. We also computed Rosenthal’s Fail-Safe N values: N = 829,029 and 436,029 for the r- and rxy.z-based correlation results respectively. These numbers represent the number of missing studies averaging a z-value of zero that should be added to our sample to make the combined effect size statistically insignificant.

# Abstract

Sustainable development refers to an economic, environmental and social development that meets the needs of the present and does not prevent future generations from fulfilling their needs. In this context, businesses play an important role. However, progress towards sustainable development has been slow, indicating the need for more concrete guidance that will allow businesses to act strategically and successfully in a sustainable way. This theoretical paper connects three distinct, but complementary, dimensions of strategic management as viewed from the perspective of sustainability in order to encourage the integration of sustainability issues into corporate activities and strategies. These three dimensions are: strategy process, strategy content and strategy context. Sixteen propositions related to these dimensions have been developed to explore the contributions of corporate sustainability management to the creation of value for businesses, society and nature. This theoretical discussion contributes to existing research in that it reveals relationships between strategic management and sustainable development and provides an agenda for further empirical research.

# 1. Introduction

Sustainable development, as defined by the Brundtland commission, tackles global environmental and social challenges and aims to provide a generic framework that allows the development of solutions that address these challenges (WCED, 1987). However, in its basic normative and ethical form, the concept of sustainable development offers no clear guidance with regard to which strategies, plans or activities need to be implemented. Consequently, a plethora of related guidelines and definitions have emerged. In order for the concept to become more binding, concrete and actionable, participation is required from numerous actors at various levels of society. Contributions from individuals, organizations, regions, states and societies are all relevant in any kind of sustainability-oriented development.

The focus in this paper has been placed on the role of industrial organizations in this process, since these play important roles in the transition of societies towards sustainability (the term sustainability is used here to describe the final goal of sustainable development, that is, a state where sustainability principles have been met (Broman and Robèrt, 2015)). Approaches such as corporate environmental management, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability reporting have all been developed to help corporations manage various aspects of sustainability. Other examples are the integration of sustainability issues into cost accounting (Atkinson, 2000), the discussion of change management processes for corporate sustainability (Benn et al., 2014), integrated management systems to support corporate sustainability (Oskarsson and von Malmborg, 2005), differences in institutional settings that influence corporate sustainability practices in the US and in Europe (Tschopp, 2005), or frameworks based on the EFQM model (van Marrewijk and Hardjono, 2003).

However, the impacts of these approaches seem to be rather limited (Hopwood et al., 2005; Sneddon et al., 2006; Goncz et al. 2007). One reason for this is the lack of strategic orientation with respect to the introduction and implementation of sustainability-related practices and goals (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010). In this paper, it is our intention to describe how the strategic relevance of sustainability management may be improved (i.e., in the sense that both business success and sustainable development may be reinforced). This line of reasoning follows the approach of Korhonen, who distinguished between two different levels of sustainability theory: that of generating favorable planning and management outcomes with respect to sustainable development, and that of concrete and practical action (Korhonen, 2004). The propositions presented in this paper relate explicitly to the first level. Hence, the main objective of this research is a) to reflect upon the link between sustainability-oriented management and the attainment of sustainable development goals, and b) to improve the strategic relevance of management approaches in the sense mentioned above. The intention is to overcome a central limitation of current corporate sustainability management and CSR, namely, the difficulties inherent in identifying and attaining goals that contribute significantly to sustainable.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

development. Specific propositions are formulated related to sustainability-oriented practices and goals that can help overcome these barriers and provide support for decision makers during the strategic implementation and execution of sustainability management.

The following research questions are addressed in this paper:

1. How can a strategic perspective of corporate sustainability management be conceptualized?
2. How can strategic success of corporate sustainability management be defined?
3. How can corporations act more sustainably from a strategic point of view?

To answer the first research question, three strategy perspectives (i.e., strategy process, strategy content and strategy context) are introduced, and the relationships that can be correlated with corporate sustainability management are defined. To answer the second research question, the potential effects of corporate sustainability activities on the individual corporation, the business sector, the society and the natural environment are analyzed. To answer the third research question, the process dimension is operationalized. Key propositions are then presented to exemplify the answers to the research questions (see sections 3 and 4). In addition, an example for each key proposition is presented; however, the propositions themselves need to be verified through future research.

The paper is structured as follows: three strategic perspectives are introduced and discussed in section 2; the outcomes and impacts of corporate sustainability management with respect to business and society are described in section 3; an analysis of the process dimension of corporate sustainability management appears in section 4; and the research results are interpreted and discussed in section 5.

# 2 Strategic perspectives of corporate sustainability management

In the context of business management research and practice, Hinterhuber (2004) defines strategy as a way of using the resources and capabilities of an organization. Boddy (2005) describes strategy as a way to decide what business an organization should be in, where it wants to be and how it is going to operate. Strategic management theory distinguishes between the market-based view of strategic management (Porter, 1980), the resource-based view (Barney, 1991), the emergent strategies view (Mintzberg and Waters, 1985) and the relational view (Dyer and Singh 1998).

In general, the use of the term ‘strategic’ implies that there is an overall goal, or some specific vision concerning the nature of success. All actors and their actions contribute to a common vision, an overall goal. A plan for attaining the

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

defined goals under conditions of uncertainty is named a ‘strategy’, and ‘strategic’ can, thus, be employed to describe anything that is believed to contribute to strategy implementation and goal attainment (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010).

As used in this paper, the term ‘strategic perspective’ sheds light on two important aspects of corporate sustainability management:

1. The aspect of the goals and benefits of corporate sustainability management. Usually, environmental and social goals are embodied in all approaches to sustainability management. However, the question of who specifically will benefit from sustainability management is subject to much less discussion. For example, which individual, group, organization, or system is expected to be better off after the implementation of corporate sustainability management?
2. The aspect of how to implement corporate sustainability management. This is related to the process of identifying sustainability-related goals and determining how they may be implemented in an organization. Since the notion of sustainability often lacks clarity and can be subject to many forms of interpretation, the identification of appropriate goals and their effective and efficient implementation are challenging tasks in any type of organization.

By way of providing a theoretical starting point, three distinct, but complementary, dimensions of strategic management are used here: strategy process, strategy content and strategy context (Pettigrew, 1987; De Wit and Meyer, 2004). These dimensions were first introduced into the field of sustainability science by Baumgartner and Korhonen (2010).

Strategy process, content and context are distinct, but interrelated, components of strategy. These three dimensions provide a framework to explain and interpret strategic thinking in the present paper. Developing a strategy for a company entails the definition of the content of a strategy. Specifically, the ‘what’, ‘when’ and ‘how’ of strategic activities with respect to specific external and internal factors (the context) must be determined. The starting point for this process is the ‘why’; the purpose of the whole endeavor must be ascertained. The purpose can be, for example, to develop economically efficient and ecologically sustainable products.

The three strategy dimensions may be defined as follows:

- The strategy process itself comprises the construction and development phase of a strategy.
- The conditions surrounding strategic activities are the strategy context. The context influences the possibilities and limitations of the strategy. For example, regulations, natural resource scarcities, or pressures/innovations arising from NGOs can impose limits on, or provide opportunities for, organizations and communities.
- The strategy content represents the output of the strategy process, what is termed the result of strategic activities. This covers what is offered, what is.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

created, the goals that the organization/community in question should pursue, what the organization/community in question needs to do to achieve their goals and the implications of the endeavor for the organization, community and its different shareholders and stakeholders (including the implications for the global social system and the natural ecosystem).

A closer examination of corporate sustainability strategies and sustainable strategic management is also presented in this paper. Corporate sustainability strategies describe how sustainability issues are dealt with in practice. In profit-oriented organizations, these usually form a subset of the corporate competitive strategy. One essential item here is the advantage that is identified by the management board while pursuing sustainability, that is, the strategic reason stated for developing and implementing a specific corporate sustainability strategy. This strategic decision can be grounded in normative-ethical considerations or in (pure) economic rationality, or both. If it is the former, sustainable development is seen as a superior goal that is motivated by ethical issues. If it is the latter, the economic advantages that may be gained from improving sustainable behavior are stressed. The term ‘economic’ is used here in a relatively broad sense and encompasses such things as cost reductions, increased competitiveness, improved company image and reputation, all of which help ensure that corporate activities meet the legal requirements (Baumgartner, 2014). Viewed in an even broader context, this may also include the proactive influence that a company seeks with regard to their influence on public policy and regulations on sustainability.

The main reason for choosing a sustainability approach is to reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of corporate activities while improving (or at least not reducing) the economic performance of the corporation. In addition, corporate sustainability can improve the sustainability performance of other actors and systems. In principle, the individual company, business community, society and nature can all benefit from more sustainable corporate behavior. Both external developments and internal strengths and weaknesses need to be considered when attempting to integrate sustainable development issues into strategic planning (Eccles et al., 2012; Engert et al., 2016). Consequently, a corporate sustainability strategy integrates social and environmental dimensions into the strategic management process and highlights the strategic position of a company with regard to sustainable development.

The integration of environmental and social issues into corporate mid-term and long-term goals demands that a careful balance be achieved between the needs of internal and external stakeholders. This is essential to maintain or improve corporate sustainability performance. As the needs of stakeholders and the environment tend to vary, both over time and according to the geographic setting, the strategic planning process must be sufficiently flexible. Basically, corporate sustainability strategies can be distinguished on the basis of whether they have

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

An internal focus (introverted or conservative) or an external focus (extroverted and visionary) (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010). Operational and normative issues also impact the integration of sustainability (Baumgartner, 2014). The normative management level comprises those values that are shared by the management board and embedded in the organizational culture. For example, the degree to which the prevailing culture welcomes or resists the notion of sustainable development is likely to have a huge impact (Baumgartner, 2009; Linnenluecke and Griffith, 2009). At the operational level, clear, short-term, departmental goals must be derived on the basis of the corporate sustainability strategy. This means that it has to be clearly communicated throughout the organization (Baumgartner, 2014). Further cultural elements that support the adoption of a sustainable strategy are an ability and willingness to accept change, a commitment to innovation and the existence of high levels of trust within the organization (Eccles et al., 2012).

# 3 Societal and business outcome of sustainable strategic management

In this section, the societal and business values of strategic sustainability management are discussed. Here, two aspects are relevant: first, the definition of sustainability-related outcomes, and second, the question of which entity is expected to benefit from this sustainability-related outcome (on this point, also see the definition of the term “strategic perspective” in section 2). Regarding the latter point, it is necessary to distinguish between the societal and business values of corporate sustainability. Creating societal value1 through corporate sustainability management requires the achievement of compatibility between the content of the strategy and the needs of society and the biosphere. This is discussed in section 3.1. Integrating the context dimension into strategy formulation enables corporate sustainability management to create business value. This is discussed in section 3.2.

# 3.1 Societal value of sustainable strategic management – the content dimension

In its most basic form, sustainable development meets the needs of the present generations such that the needs of future generations are not compromised (WCED, 1987). Once it has been agreed upon that all members of society are responsible for creating such a sustainable form of development, companies are also expected to act responsibly. All corporate activities have an influence on society and the natural environment and, therefore, may (or may not) contribute to sustainable development.

How can companies create societal value while contributing to sustainable development? To answer this question, it is necessary to look more closely at the

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

impacts of business on societies and the natural environment. These impacts then need to be integrated into the content dimension of strategy. One must clarify how sustainable strategic management can reduce negative social and environmental impacts and contribute to improving social and environmental outcomes.

A company is a system that transforms resources (i.e., inputs) into saleable products and services as well as into unwanted by-products, waste and emissions (Hinterhuber, 2004). In order to do so, the company must deliver appropriate returns to those who provide the company with resources (see Figure 1). Management coordinates internal activities as well as its relationships with customers, shareholders, suppliers, partner companies, authorities, society and the stakeholders in general.

Sustainability issues can be divided into economic (see Table 1), environmental (see Table 2) and social issues (see Table 3), and are related to all input and output flows. With regard to management methods and instruments, companies can implement and run environmental (e.g., ISO 14001; EMAS) or social (e.g., SA 8000) management systems, integrated management systems (Oskarsson and von Malmborg, 2005; Jørgensen et al., 2006), or use specific management instruments to address environmental or social issues (such as LCA or social LCA, sustainability balanced scorecards (Figge et al., 2002), or environmental cost accounting (Atkinson, 2000)).

Economic sustainability embraces several general aspects of an organization that need to be respected, in addition to environmental and social aspects, in order to maintain the competitiveness of the company (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010). Financial stability and liquidity, profitability and financial benefits that are the result of sustainability activities are primary elements making up the economic dimension (Labuschagne et al., 2005). Therefore, issues such as

Innovation and technology management, collaboration, knowledge management, organizational processes and purchase or sustainability reporting are important economic aspects of corporate sustainability (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010).

|Economic aspects of corporate sustainability (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010)|Description|
|---|---|
|Innovation and Technology|Effort made in sustainability-related R&D to reduce the environmental impacts of new products and business activities. Use of BAT (Best Available Techniques) and integrated environmental technologies, concentrating on cleaner production and zero emission technologies.|
|Collaboration|Good cooperation and active collaboration with various partners (e.g., suppliers, R&D institutions, universities). Working in shared programs and networks on the development of innovative products and technologies. Exchange of information and knowledge.|
|Knowledge Management|Activities and approaches that keep knowledge related to sustainability in the organization. Methods to plan, develop, organize, maintain, transfer, apply and measure specific knowledge and improve the organizational knowledge base.|
|Processes|Clear processes and roles are defined so that business activities are efficiently conducted, and every employee knows what the organization expects from him or her (also with respect to sustainability). Adaptations of process management to achieve sustainability necessitate the systematic implementation of corporate sustainability. Integration of sustainability into daily business life.|
|Purchase|Consideration of issues related to sustainability in purchasing. Awareness and consideration of issues related to sustainability in the organization, as well as throughout the supply chain. Relationships with suppliers, with a focus also placed on sustainability.|
|Sustainability Reporting|Inclusion of issues related to sustainability in company reports, either in individual sustainability reports or integrated in corporate reports.|

These sustainability issues provide the basis for the definition of a corporate sustainability strategy (Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; Baumgartner, 2014). The strategies with an external focus (extroverted and visionary sustainability strategy) are likely to have a particularly strong societal impact. By achieving improvements in terms of the sustainability issues described above, both internal and external stakeholders (employees, customers, consumers, suppliers, neighbors and society itself) are likely to benefit.

An important task for management is now to identify the economic, environmental and social issues that are important to the company. This may be done by applying the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) with its five-level model sustainability principles, ABCD-planning procedure and funnel-metaphor (Broman and Robèrt, 2015). The FSSD is recommended because it provides robust, comprehensive and generic principles for sustainability, as well as a logical process for integrating these principles into strategic planning. The funnel-metaphor is included in the FSSD to indicate how a current (non-sustainable) business practice will reduce the decision-making autonomy of companies in the mid- to long-term, since they are confronted with, for example, continually increasing social pressures and resource costs. This will lead to increased financial risks, and these are likely to be lower for more sustainable companies. By using the ABCD-planning process, a company can identify its options to comply with the FSSD sustainability principles and reduce the risk of sudden costs that jeopardize opportunities and are difficult to predict, as well as stay informed about cutting edge sustainability-driven business developments (Ny et al., 2006).

Not all businesses have a positive social value, however, and whether a company delivers a positive societal value or not is based on societal perceptions about the company’s products and services, as well as its physical impact on the natural environment. There is, for instance, a considerable consensus that producing nuclear weapons does not generate positive societal values. In the case of conventional weapon systems, however, arguments concerning their relative social value are more mixed. Whether cars or coffee pods have a positive societal value is also debated.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

value is even more controversial. While both products have positive impacts on individual users, they also have clear systemic disadvantages. However, identifying the societal value of business activities from a sustainability perspective requires the application of robust sustainability principles as defined by the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (Broman and Robèrt, 2015).

Below, four propositions are made, indicating how corporate sustainability management may enhance societal value.

# Proposition 1a:

Integrating environmental and social issues into the content dimension of strategic management is a prerequisite to creating societal value.

# Example 1a:

Considering environmental (such as CO2 emissions in production processes or the product portfolio) and social issues (such as working conditions throughout the supply chain) in strategic decisions to reduce negative impacts is beneficial for society and the biosphere.

The measurement of whether a company creates societal values from a sustainability perspective requires a benchmark or reference point. With regard to economic criteria, indicators such as tax payments, investment in local communities, or R&D expenditures are commonly used. With regard to environmental and social sustainability criteria, the Brundtland definition of sustainable development must be operationalized. Environmental and social problems may arise, for instance, from damage caused by emissions or poor working conditions. For example, Labuschagne et al. (2005), Krajnc and Glavic (2005) or Cunha Callado and Fensterseifer (2011) provided frameworks that could be used to measure corporate economic, environmental and social impacts. However, defining all kinds of environmental and social impacts is highly challenging, not only because different spatial conditions that change over time apply, but also because of the interdependencies between different issues and their impacts. Nevertheless, by focusing on the major factors involved, relatively robust sustainability principles can still be defined (Robèrt, 2000). Using the principles as defined in the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (Broman and Robèrt, 2015) provides a solid, stable and comprehensive basis for assessing whether corporations create societal values or not. Additionally, these sustainability principles can be used as guides to define sustainability criteria (Hallstedt, 2015).

# Proposition 1b:

In order to measure the societal value of corporate sustainability management, the operationalization of sustainable development needs to be testable. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development offers this kind of operationalization.

11

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

# Example 1b: Companies that are aware of their sustainability activities

measure them by using criteria and key performance indicators linked to the FSSD principles.

The sustainability performance of a company is based on the environmental, economic and social impacts of the resources used by the company, the products and services provided and the emissions, waste and by-products generated. The overall impact of these effects on society, however, also depends on the prevailing perceptions of the external stakeholders and the prevailing socio-cultural and economic conditions. The relationship between the company’s performance and its impacts is referred to as the sustainability impact chain (see Figure 2). The existing level of welfare in a region will have an influence the acceptance level of the environmental or social impacts. For example, in times of economic crisis, the relevance of environmental protection might decline as compared to that of job opportunities.

# External stakeholders

Figure 2: Sustainability impact chain (based on Laudal, 2011)

The environmental impacts on nature are not dependent on socio-cultural or economic conditions, since they are based on physical and chemical processes. However, the relevance of the extent of a given impact on nature with respect to societal and organizational decision processes depends on both the prevailing socio-cultural and economic conditions and the relevance of these impacts as perceived by the stakeholders. Within society, those negatively affected can articulate their problems themselves. Nature and the biosphere do not have this option. Therefore, they need some form of ‘translator’, or voice in society.

12

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

# Proposition 1c

The sustainability performance of an organization is based on corporate activities. The extent to which the related impacts on society and nature are considered relevant and tolerable is additionally influenced by socio-cultural and economic conditions.

# Example 1c

This proposition addresses the public perception of the relevance of sustainability issues and the perceptions of members of the management team. For instance, climate change is usually more often interpreted as a severe threat to society and nature than the loss of biodiversity due to corporate activities. When assessing a company’s sustainability performance, the socio-cultural and economic conditions should be taken into account. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development offers principles that can be used for such an assessment.

The environmental and social performance of existing structures, systems and processes can be increased without altering the existing structures. In this case, the efficiency of the system (i.e., its probability of functioning correctly) is increased; this type of performance is defined as first-order sustainability performance. In many cases, however, increasing efficiency alone might not be sufficient and existing structures and systems must be challenged to increase environmental and social performance (Dyllick and Hockerts, 2002). The need for a second-order level of sustainability performance exists, which allows the systemic effects to be taken into account and integrates the idea of effectiveness (i.e., that the correct things are being done) into the analysis. Drawing a distinction between the first- and second-order sustainability performances highlights the difference between attempting to make short-term improvements in efficiency and creating a more systematic form of innovation with sustainable development in mind. Second-order sustainability performance helps both the organization and society, in general, to become more sustainable.

# Proposition 1d

While assessing the impact of business activities, one needs to take both first- and second-order levels of sustainability into account. First-order levels are related to narrow issues of efficiency, while second-order levels are broader, and more closely related to systemic effectiveness.

# Example 1d

Increasing the efficiency of existing processes and products, such as raising the fuel efficiency of gasoline-fueled cars or improving the efficiency of recycling processes are examples of first-order sustainability performance. Second-order sustainability performance involves the introduction of new technologies, products and services such as new closed-loop electronic waste management with a focus on reuse, refurbishment and remanufacturing.

These four propositions describe concepts of the societal value of corporate sustainability management, which is based on the integration of robust sustainability principles into the strategy content. The distinction made between

# 3.2 The business value of sustainable strategic management – adding the context dimension

Companies that want to achieve higher levels of sustainability emphasize the potential extra value that can be created for the business by choosing this path; the impact of their choice on society and the natural environment tend to be secondary considerations. Corporate goals must be more carefully examined, before a discussion of the business value of corporate sustainability management can be made. The analysis of corporate goals is a central topic in management research (Macharzina and Wolf, 2008). From the viewpoint of sustainability, the question arises as to what extent environmental and social goals are considered by companies, and how sustainability-related goals and other corporate goals are related. The relationships between environmental and/or social goals and economic goals can be complementary, competitive, or irrelevant (Wöhe and Döring, 2008). In the case of complementary relationships, fulfilling one type of goal helps achieve other types of goals; where relationships are competitive, pursuing one type of goal can have a negative influence on the attainment of other types of goals; and where relationships are irrelevant, no mutual influences between different goals, antagonistic or otherwise, can be observed.

Companies pursue environmental and social goals for two basic reasons. First, companies may be forced to do so by the owner, members of legislation, stakeholders, or market pressures. Second, companies voluntarily pursue sustainability, either because they are ethically motivated (Wöhe and Döring, 2008) or because they expect economic benefits to be gained (Kurucz et al., 2008). In other words, the desire to integrate sustainable issues may be driven by normative considerations, ethical rationality or economic rationality. The latter can be internally derived, when sustainable actions are combined with competitive advantages, or externally derived, when a company is forced to undertake sustainable activities (Baumgartner, 2014).

To understand the business value of sustainable strategic management, the interests or utility to the company must be analyzed. Corporate sustainability management can influence the productivity and efficiency of processes, support the development of more sustainable products and services, reduce the risks associated with environmental and social impacts and improve the credentials of a company. The resulting benefits may reveal themselves in the form of an improvement in financial performance or improved competitive strength. The former may arise in the form of higher profits, reduced costs, or increases in share prices. The latter are, in turn, derived from the increased innovation capacity, enhanced public image or reputation, increased revenues, increased employee satisfaction, productivity increases, or an increase in the market share.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

For instance, Kurucz et al. (2008) differentiated among the following four benefits of corporate sustainability management:

1. reductions in costs and risks
2. improvements in competitiveness
3. improvements in reputation and legitimacy
4. creation of value by seeking win-win outcomes

Companies are part of the business sector, and sustainability orientation can also enhance the competitiveness of this business sector. However, the risk of path dependency also exists. Taking only first-order sustainability performance into account (see section 3.1) can lead to situations where the overall sustainability performance of a sector is lower as compared to situations in which second-order sustainability performance is realized. For instance, improving the efficiency of a given industry structure can increase its short-term competitiveness, but lower its opportunities to shift the whole sector to a higher sustainability level (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010). As mentioned above, the benefits in a narrow sense could have a positive influence on costs or revenues.

# Proposition 2a:

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management in a narrow sense is based on reduced costs or increased revenues.

# Example 2a:

Energy savings can be achieved in operations or higher margins can be gained by focusing on organic food. These so-called win-win-situations can be verified by examining the ensuing reductions in costs and environmental impact (e.g., where less energy is used to heat a building).

Freeman points out the important role that stakeholders play in long-term company success (Freeman, 1984). Stakeholders may support or hinder the implementation of corporate strategies (Michelon et al., 2012). A credible CSR policy allows a company to expand its operations without incurring stakeholder resistance (i.e., on the part of neighbors, NGOs, or society, in general). It is, therefore, important that sustainability management policies are perceived as being legitimate and worthwhile.

# Proposition 2b:

When embarking on corporate sustainability, improving public and stakeholder perceptions with regard to acceptability of company activities is likely to generate economic benefits.

# Example 2b:

A policy of active stakeholder management (i.e., a policy that genuinely takes into account the expectations and wishes of stakeholders) can be used to heighten public acceptance of company activity.

Decision makers must be open and reflect critically on their actions while considering the social and environmental aspects of products, services, processes and strategies. This is particularly true where systemic effects (i.e.,

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Second-order sustainability) are taken into account. Improving corporate environmental and social performance implies a readiness to engage in new ideas about how more sustainable technologies, structures, services and products can be employed and is, therefore, a potential source for organizational innovation. Moreover, a willingness to question the value of current services, products and processes, engage in critical self-reflection and provide room for organizational learning processes are fundamental for innovative activities (Vollenbroek, 2002; Schiederig et al., 2012; Bönte and Dienes, 2013).

# Proposition 2c

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on increased innovation.

# Example 2c

The integration of sustainability topics into the product design process may lead to more innovative products as compared to those generated using a conventional product design process. For instance, introducing a lightweight design in industry strengthened technological competence in several sectors.

Offering sustainable products and services provides an opportunity for market differentiation and segmentation and to meet the specific demands of ‘green’ or ‘fair’ consumers. Sustainable products and services can address the needs of sustainability-oriented consumers and, therefore, help a company gain a selective advantage over its competitors. For instance, higher prices may be charged in customer segments such as LOHAS (lifestyle of health and sustainability) (Aburdene, 2007):

# Proposition 2d

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on increased market differentiation.

# Example 2d

Toyota’s introduction of its hybrid car “Prius” in the US is one example. In general, at the operational level, companies also need to critically analyze services and products offered, the related turnover and market developments over a certain period of time in order to better understand whether sustainability management has led to increased market performance.

One important aspect to consider when providing sustainable products and services is the minimization of negative environmental and social impacts throughout their lifecycle. This is often associated with the ‘dematerialization’ of a product or service, which can lead to product-service systems (Roy, 2000; Mont, 2002; Tukker, 2004; Tukker and Tischner, 2006; Gelbmann and Hammerl, 2014). The resulting systems tend to be characterized by the fact that the need for a ‘product’ as a service, rather than the product or service itself, is the selling point.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

for customers. In such cases, customers no longer wish to buy a product, they merely wish to pay for the use or service the ‘product’ delivers.

# Proposition 2e:

The change from classical product-selling business models to product-service systems can significantly reduce the negative environmental and social impacts of a product.

# Example 2e:

Product life cycle analyses are used to reveal the impact of a product on the environment and illustrate which respective actors are responsible for various impacts (producer, consumer, or disposer). This helps introduce changes into the business model (although potential rebound effects also need to be considered) where the economic rationale supports selling services, rather than only products.

A business model describes how a company delivers products and services to customers and how revenues are generated (Zott al., 2011, Boons and Lüdeke-Freund, 2013). In proposition 2e, the number of services sold within the product-service system, rather than the number of products sold, determines economic success. This represents a new type of business model. Another example is related to the creation of a stakeholder value as opposed to a shareholder value (i.e., an essential element of second-order sustainability performance). Such arrangements are often referred to as “sustainable” or “green” business models (Bocken et al., 2014; Rauter et al., 2015).

# Proposition 2f:

The economic benefit of corporate sustainability management, in a broader sense, can be based on the development of new business models.

# Example 2f:

Looking for ways to increase corporate environmental and social performance can provide an impulse to redesign the current business model and/or develop a new business model. This is done in the textile industry when companies fully restructure their supply chains, taking sustainability issues into account (e.g., Rauter et al., 2015).

Capturing the potential business value that will be derived from corporate sustainability management is only possible when relevant opportunities are identified. To do this, the various aspects of sustainability need to be integrated into the ‘context dimension’. The business value gained in a narrow sense is based on the ability to reduce costs and increase profits. In the broader sense, benefits are based on improved competitiveness, improved innovation capacity and the introduction of new business models.

# Developing and initiating a sustainable organization – the process dimension of sustainable strategic management

While sections 3.1 and 3.2 dealt with strategy content and strategy context, this section focuses on strategy process. The strategy process concerns the

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Construction and development of strategy (i.e., the ‘how’, ‘who’ and ‘when’ of strategy formation) (Baumgartner and Korhonen, 2010). In terms of corporate sustainability management, the strategy process must ensure that sustainability issues are integrated across all relevant corporate levels and systems such that the resulting business and societal values may be adequately captured. This means that sustainability issues are integrated into the organizational culture, the strategic goal setting, learning and feedback loops and into the daily activities of the company.

Three management levels can be distinguished (Ulrich, 2001), which are also relevant for corporate sustainability management (Baumgartner, 2014): the normative, strategic and operational levels. The normative level encompasses the basic management philosophy: the values, attitudes, beliefs and judgments, which together make up the organizational culture. This culture provides the basis for managing the organization (Baumgartner and Zielowski, 2007; Baumgartner, 2009; Linnenluecke and Griffith, 2009). The normative level guides issues that are related to the question “Who are we and who do we want to be?” This leads to the following proposition that refers to the normative level:

# Proposition 3a

The organizational culture has a strong influence on the different steps necessary in the development towards a ‘sustainable organization’. The higher the level of sustainability awareness within an organization, the more ambitious the goals and strategies deployed when pursuing sustainable development.

# Example 3a

Baumgartner (2009) provides the example of a global mining company in order to illustrate the relationships between basic values, assumptions and strategic orientation.

Long-term goals and product/service-market combinations are defined at the strategic management level. From a sustainability perspective, it is important that the business and societal values of corporate sustainability management are clearly identified and developed (see section 3.1 and 3.2; again, the FSSD with its backcasting approach and sustainability principles is very helpful). This requires the identification of specific contextual factors and evaluation of the relevance of sustainability issues for the company:

# Proposition 3b

Defining short-term and long-term goals in corporate sustainability management requires the clarification of the societal and business values that will be derived.

# Example 3b

A short-term goal could be the reduction of energy consumption per employee per year. A corresponding long-term goal might be the constant reduction in energy consumption together with the exclusive use of renewable energies in energy production.

18

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Implementing a corporate sustainability strategy at the operational level requires the integration of non-economic issues of sustainability. Matters that are not normally considered to be part of the remit of standard business administration must be addressed. The need to rely on and enhance employee capabilities is a key point. Specific feedback and learning loops must be established across different management levels. Most importantly, it must be possible to transfer the experience gained at the operational level to the strategic and normative levels, or experience gained at the strategic level to the normative level (Baumgartner, 2014). Furthermore, all organizational departments need to be involved in sustainability implementation, at least to some extent. To summarize these issues, the following proposition has been developed:

# Proposition 3c

A corporate sustainability strategy matches its goals with its organizational capabilities, the organizational responsibilities of different departments and the geographical and temporal system boundaries.

# Example 3c

To define and implement a corporate sustainability strategy, it is necessary to identify the capabilities needed within the organization (e.g., the respective competencies in LCA or materials technology), and the departments involved in corporate sustainability activities (e.g., marketing, engineering, R&D). Additionally, decisions must be made in terms of time, location and operational technique.

Implementing corporate sustainability management requires change and learning processes in any organization. Usually, three different levels of organizational learning may be distinguished: adoption-learning (single-loop-learning), change-learning (double-loop-learning) and learning to learn (deuteron learning) (Argyris and Schön, 1978). From a sustainability point of view, the organizational learning processes raise a number of interesting questions, such as those that address the extent to which it is possible to communicate and understand the long-term aspects of sustainability, or those concerning the nature and extent of the uncertainty associated with long-term development and interactions among environmental, social and economic issues from local, regional and global perspectives (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al., 2009; Probst and Büchel, 1994; Müller-Christ, 2001). According to Siebenhüner and Arnold (2007), sustainability-oriented values must be integrated into an organization before any sustainability-oriented learning processes can take place. It is essential, therefore, to gain sufficient qualifications and receive enough training support.

Change processes are doomed to failure unless the members of an organization possess the sufficient ability to learn (Bieker, 2005). The newer the strategy, structure and processes are to a company, the less compatible they are with the prevailing organizational culture, and the more intensive the organizational change and learning processes needed (Schein, 1995). This consideration led to the development of the following proposition:

19

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

# Proposition 3d

Corporate sustainability management should facilitate mutual learning processes to address challenges related to sustainable development. These learning processes are based on feedback loops in and among all organizational departments and management levels.

# Example 3d

Goal-oriented learning mechanisms, the integration of milestones into existing R&D processes, formalized instruments of communication, self-organized working groups, guideline-oriented learning processes and project work for learning processes all illustrate how learning may be embedded in the context of corporate sustainable development (Siebenhüner and Arnold, 2007).

The objective of operational management is to execute strategic guidelines and plans and attain the set strategic goals in the most efficient way. The corporate sustainability strategy is implemented at the operational level of management, in terms of how the vision, mission, long-term goals and strategic plans are executed within the company. The focus is placed on the various corporate functions such as on logistics and materials management, production, maintenance, marketing, public relations, human resources and communication. Innovation and continuous improvement are seen as cross-functional areas, which are integrated into other corporate functions. Specific sustainability-oriented activities must be carried out as part of each corporate function.

# Proposition 3e

Developing a sustainable organization requires the integration of issues of sustainability into the operational management level and the consideration of their relevance for all activities, routines and processes.

# Example 3e

Sustainability needs to be operationalized for all activities, processes and routines, for instance, with the implementation of ISO 14001 with regard to environmental issues. Additionally, various aspects of sustainability need to be specified and should appear in all relevant organizational and decision processes (e.g., in descriptions of functional specifications, criteria for the selection of suppliers, eco-design-principles).

While, in theory, the focus tends to be placed on so-called win-win situations, in reality, companies must deal with the conflicts and trade-offs among economic, social and environmental goals. They must often choose between generating business value and societal value in corporate sustainability management. Companies are embedded in a dynamic form of interplay that involves economic, societal and natural systems (Hjorth and Bagheri, 2006). To deal with any emerging or prevailing antagonisms and trade-offs, decision makers need to understand the nature of the economic, environmental and social benefits and how these are related to corporate activities.

20

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

# Proposition 3f

In order to deal with trade-offs and win-lose situations that are related to economic, environmental and other social goals, decision makers need to consider both short- and long-term effects of their decisions on the company, society and natural environment.

# Example 3f

One example is the difference between the investment cost of new production equipment, the total costs of ownership (TCO) and the environmental impact over the product life cycle. Sometimes, higher investments can lead to reduced TCO and environmental impacts. The question is whether decision makers are aware of the respective trade-offs involved and are willing to accept the long-term consequences.

This last proposition presents the final component in our discussion of the strategy process of corporate sustainability management. The FSSD provides support (see section 3.1) for overcoming trade-offs in win-lose situations and provides businesses with general assistance that enables them to gain a cutting-edge position in sustainability-driven markets, while achieving a balance between sustainability compliance and return on investment.

# 5 Discussion and Conclusions

Businesses are central actors in any societal transition towards sustainability. However, even though concepts such as CSR, environmental management and corporate sustainability management have been subjects of discussion for many years, the advances that have been achieved are still limited. In fact, to date, only limited progress towards sustainable development has been observed.

The underlying goal of this paper was to introduce strategic management into the discussion of corporate sustainability in order to clarify various aspects related to corporate sustainability management. This should enable companies to create business and societal value through their sustainability-related activities. Arguments posed in this paper not only suggest theoretical propositions, but also provide concrete examples of how these propositions could be practically applied (see Table 4).

The lack of strategic orientation in corporate sustainability management is one major reason for lack of progress in this field. This can be offset to some extent by clarifying the respective opportunities, benefits, risks and trade-offs associated with the implementation of corporate sustainability.

Three dimensions of strategic management – strategy content, context and process – have been introduced in order to clarify how corporate sustainability management can help create economic, environmental and social value. The various propositions presented highlight the relationships among the three strategic dimensions and the various elements of corporate sustainability management.

Propositions 1a-d show how (first- and second-order) sustainability performance may be linked to the generation of added value for society. Propositions 2a-f describe the benefits that may be derived from corporate sustainability management for a company. Finally, propositions 3a-f describe how the various aspects of sustainability may be integrated into organizational structures at the normative, strategic and operational management levels.

Figure 3: Strategic perspectives integrated into a corporate sustainability impact chain

The answers to the research questions (see section 1) are discussed below.

The first research question (“How can a strategic perspective of corporate sustainability management be conceptualized?”) was addressed by introducing three dimensions of strategic management: strategy process, content and context.

The second research question (“How can strategic success of corporate sustainability management be defined?”) was addressed by distinguishing between the societal value and business value of corporate sustainability management. By making use of first- and second-order sustainability performance levels, the various elements relevant to the assessment of the success of corporate sustainability management were identified. First-order sustainability performance focuses on the maximization of economic, social and environmental efficiency, whereas second-order sustainability performance is characterized by its focus on systemic effectiveness.

The third research question (“How can corporations act more sustainably from a strategic point of view?”) was addressed in section 4 through a description of the process dimension and related propositions. Figure 3 shows how the strategic perspectives are integrated in the sustainability impact chain (as described in section 3.1). Integrating sustainability considerations into the strategy context is necessary to create business value. In the absence of the latter, companies.

would ignore the relevant sustainability issues. Matching strategy content to societal needs allows a company to create societal value.

The paper offers both scientific and practical contributions. By combining the currently somewhat distant fields of classical management and sustainability, the paper makes a scientific contribution in that it provides, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the first holistic perspective on corporate sustainability management. This helps fill gaps in the ongoing discussion about connections between issues of (strategic) management and sustainability. The practical contribution consists of specific examples, which were given to support the theoretical propositions made. This provides managers with a comprehensive overview of topics that are relevant to the integration of sustainability into daily business activities. Scholars and practitioners are invited to improve, test and amend these propositions as part of further research.

# Abstract

The rise of the Sustainable Development (SD) concept contributed to the increasing interest in practices encompassing the Sustainable Human Resource Management (Sustainable HRM) and the results of these practices. This article relates to the area of Human Resource Management and activities undertaken by HR departments to implement the principles of sustainable development in the enterprise. In particular, it refers to the concept of Sustainable HRM, recognized by many researchers as a new paradigm in the area of HRM. Although an intensely-studied subject, there is a clear gap in research regarding Sustainable HRM in Polish companies. Additionally, there is a lack of research contribution on the Podlasie region—ecologically and ethnically the most diverse region in the country. While sustainability in environmental terms is evident in the region, the article focuses on sustainability implementation in the business sector. The article helps to close the research gap. Its aim is to examine the two-fold role of HR departments in: Implementing activities in the area of Sustainable HRM, and introducing the principles of sustainability to corporate strategies. It was assumed that such activities contribute to corporate sustainability. In order to verify the role of HR departments, a new, comprehensive research model, based on the work of De Prins, was built. The model relates to the double-task of HR departments in organizations. The added value of the article stems from the research model proposal, which can be applied without geographical limitations and to numerous organization types. The paper introduces one of the applications of the model—a regional one. The model was tested in a questionnaire survey conducted among employees of enterprises operating in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, which is unique in terms of environment, culture, and economy in Poland. The respondents were participants of MBA studies at one of the universities of the Podlaskie Voivodeship. The results of the study fully confirmed the hypothesis adopted in the study regarding the performance of activities by HR departments in the psychological and social areas of Sustainable HRM. The third aspect of the study, regarding the ecological area, was not clearly confirmed in the study. It was found that this may result from the restrictive law regulating the issue of the impact of enterprises on the natural environment. The results of the study allowed for the verification of the main hypothesis assumed in the research model, thus confirming its truthfulness.

# 1. Introduction

The aim of the article is to highlight the role of Human Resource Management (HRM) on the path to a sustainable organization. Stahl, Brewster, Colling, and Hajro [1] point to two different approaches to the HRM–CS (Corporate Sustainability) relation. One of these approaches is based on the assumption.

Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

that HR acts as a driver for CS. The other assumes that CS is seen as an enabler of sustainable HRM. This article is based on the assumption that the relation between CS and HRM is mutual, complex, and interactive. The article is theoretical and empirical in nature. It was created on the basis of a literature review on Sustainable HRM and Corporate Sustainability, as well as research conducted among employees of HR departments of companies operating in the region of north-eastern Poland.

In HRM literature, it is common to find that most HRM practices are shaped by strategic and economic aspirations of organizations to maximize profit [2,3]. This concept, which supports the managerial view of HRM practices and primarily aims at improving the economic performance of the company, is assumed to be the mainstream view of HRM [2, 3]. While corporations need to be profitable in order to ensure their existence; they cannot be interested in profits only when trying to reach Corporate Sustainability [4]. Organizations should be managed in the interest of more stakeholders than just the shareholder’s [5–9]. Sustainable HRM, by relating to multiple stakeholders, seems to bring the people and respect for humanity back to human resource management [10] and widen the future HR perspective by including both internal and external stakeholders as well as more employee-oriented thinking [11, 12]. Business should be conscientious not to exploit the most important asset of the company for the sole purpose of profit [13] (p. 132).

# 1.1. Corporate Sustainability

The concept of CS is related to the broader concept of sustainable development, which has been defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” [14] (p. 43). Therefore, sustainability transported to the business level is referred to as Corporate Sustainability [15].

In reference to the concept of sustainable development (SD), Corporate Sustainability can be defined as meeting the needs of a firm’s direct and indirect stakeholders without compromising its ability to meet the needs of future stakeholders as well [15]. At the organizational level, this concept of SD has been translated to CS, which “entails the preservation, regeneration, and development of the ecological, economic and social resources of a system” [16] (p. 84). As such, CS can be considered as the process of organizational change, i.e., sustainability driven change. The purpose of this change is to move the organization to the state in which equally distributed attention to economic, social, and environmental concerns is incorporated into its strategy. Ultimately, sustainability-driven change has the purpose of transforming an organization into an active agent for sustainable development [17]. Subject literature has recognized the central role of facilitating and supporting such change played by the HRM system. Therefore, companies engaging in the development of their CS at some point also invest in the development of a more Sustainable HRM.

There is a number of reasons why CS is closely related to Human Resource Management. HR could guide the organization’s leaders in the incorporation of sustainability in its strategy and help the realization of Corporate Sustainability-goals [18–20]. Sustainable HRM is seen as ‘the’ opportunity for HR to prove its own legitimacy and strategic position. Ehnert [19] regards sustainability as having a strategic potential for HRM.

# 1.2. Sustainable Management of Human Resources

Human Resource Management is an area which witnesses a constant evolution and change. The rationale behind relating the concept of human resource management with environmental issues is that it leads to sustainability and has become a new paradigm in this field [21]. Moreover, the organization’s department of human resources plays a significant role in creating a culture of sustainable development for the enterprises [22].

The concept of Sustainable HRM is the result of linking the concept of sustainable development with human resource management in an organization.

Sustainable HRM entails taking into account the economic as well as the social and ecological aspects of company objectives while implementing the human resource function. It is believed that

“HRM is the best placed to provide leadership and drive innovation to influence individuals, groups, and all organizational actors toward embracing more sustainable attitudes and behaviors” [23] (p. 813). According to Ehnert and Harry “HRM could play a vital role in implementing a sustainability mindset in business organizations” [24] (p. 236). This turns out to be a “survival strategy” for organizations dependent on high quality employees. Therefore, it is logical for organizations to apply Sustainable HRM, as it allows them to take care of what the companies should sustain. Additionally, Sustainable HRM allows for implementing a manner in which it will do so without compromising the needs of future generations of the company employees [13] (p. 136).

According to I. Ehnert [19] sustainable management of human resources means undertaking such activities that enable achieving the organization’s goals in the long term and demonstrate care for the employees at the same time. R. Kramar extends this definition by adding the element of minimizing the negative impact of the company’s activities on the natural environment, employees, and the community [25]. The author emphasizes the role of all employees of the organization in this process.

In Poland, the definition of Sustainable HRM was presented by A. Pabian, who claims “the essence of this concept is planning and recruiting employees and affecting them in such a way that they achieve economic, ecological and social goals in the enterprise, thus contributing to balancing inter-generational needs” [26] (pp. 8–9).

Until recently, it was considered that Sustainable HRM as a concept was still undefined and has not yet received much attention from scholars [27–31]. Despite the increasingly important role management plays, “the history of research on Sustainable HRM is still at the pioneering if not emerging phase. It is only in the past decade that we observe an increase in publications on sustainability and HRM (...)” [24] (p. 225). However, in recent years there has been an increased interest in Sustainable HRM. The evidence of scholarly and academic interest in Corporate Sustainability and Human Resource Management are: The edited volume by Ehnert et al., together with the special issues in journals such as Human Resource Management 51 (6), Personnel Psychology 67 (4), Journal of Organizational Behavior 34 (2), Organization 20 (3), and Management Review 23 (3), have devoted attention to Corporate Sustainability and HRM [17].

The issues raised in the research on Sustainable HRM focus on the question of whether the concept of sustainable human resource management is important in achieving sustainable development of an enterprise [32] (p. 91). The results of this study have shown that enterprises in the West Pomeranian Province, Poland, actually use the concept of the sustainable management of human resources in business management to achieve sustainable development.

Other issues undertaken in the research concern the implementation of Sustainable HRM in a SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) context in Lithuania. The results of the research (case study) showed that despite the fact that the company’s owner tried to implement some Sustainable HRM practices that were mainly related to work-life balance and health management issues, these practices were not sufficient and did not solve crucial problems such as job burnouts, lack of expertise, retention of employees, limited career development, and weak leadership, which are the issues that many authors distinguish as challenges that stop SMEs from achieving a better performance in the long run [33].

Noteworthy at this point is also a study conducted in Finnish companies on how Finnish top managers actually construct the meaning of Sustainable HRM. According to the results of the research, Sustainable HRM is organized into four (interconnected) main dimensions: Justice and equality, transparent HR practices, profitability, and employee well-being. The analysis also reveals how these dimensions are linked to different stakeholder groups. Thus, Sustainable HRM seems to bring the people and respect for humanity back to the human resource management and widen the future HR perspective to include both internal and external stakeholders. It also embraces more employee-oriented thinking in organizations, turning the leadership in a more responsible direction [34].

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

# Results of the literature review

Results of the literature review indicate that Sustainable Human Resource Management plays a significant and positive role in achieving organizational outcomes. Moreover, via the strength of the HRM system, it exerts an additional impact upon employees and external stakeholders [35].

Sustainable HRM practices enhance profit maximization for the organization and at the same time reduce the negative harmful influence on employees, their families, and communities [36]. The beneficial role of Sustainable HRM varies therefore with regards to the organization, the employees, and the society.

The positive influence Sustainable HRM has on the organization can be observed in the growth of the overall value of the organization’s worth [37–40], as well as in the increase of national and international competitiveness [41]. Those improved results can be attributed to the impact Sustainable HRM has on the employees. It can be observed that Sustainable HRM leads to improved employee engagement [42], increased employee satisfaction, and therefore higher organizational loyalty [43], HR quality boost [44], motivation growth [40, 44], employee development, and enhanced work efficiency [40].

Sustainable HRM is beneficial for the organization and for the employees, but it also positively affects other stakeholder groups. The general effect Sustainable HRM has on the society as a whole can be characterized as a contribution to the activities of the societies. Sustainable HRM incorporates activities directed towards improving communities and neighbourhoods. Additionally, it allows creating sustainable career pathways for the younger generations to become transitional on the job market and secure a better future [45].

Sustainable HRM is at times considered a new humanistic paradigm in management, which, although sometimes recognized as an alternative to the economic one, does not separate itself from the necessity of generating profit by an enterprise [5,21,32].

The direct effect of implementing the concept of Sustainable HRM is shaping sustainable human resources, i.e., highly qualified employees who understand and apply the principles of sustainable development in their work. This concept includes both: Managers setting directions at all levels of the company, as well as employees employed in non-managerial positions [20,46].

# Functions of Sustainable Human Resource Management

Sustainable Human Resource Management is assigned numerous functions in an organization. E. Cohen, S. Taylor, and M. Muller-Camen [47] claim that it:

- Supports the organization’s sustainable development strategy;
- Emphasizes fair treatment, development, and the well-being of employees;
- Contributes to building the skills, value, and trust of employees and increases their engagement in sustainable development;
- Focuses on the well-being of the internal (employees) and external (all entities interested in the functioning of the organization) stakeholders;
- Supports environmentally-friendly organizational practices.

# 1.3. Sustainable Management Research Model

One of the first attempts to capture the complexity of the concept of Sustainable Human Resource Management is the holistic model by Peggy De Prins. According to De Prins [19], Sustainable HRM focuses on the optimal use and respect of human capital in the organization in which the clear relationship between the organization’s strategic policies and the environment in which it operates is built. The model assumes four aspects of Sustainable HRM [48] (pp. 15–17): Sociological, psychological, ecological, and strategic. On the basis of the De Prins model and the Sustainable HRM aspects included in it, a research model was built that indicates the double role of HR departments, consisting in carrying out activities in the area of the three mentioned aspects and introducing them into the company’s strategy. This model is the basis in the study.

The Sustainable HRM framework, including all of those aspects, is depicted in the figure below and developed next.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

The psychological perspective focuses on the employee and, in particular, on what one deems important. If assumed that people play a key role in creating a lasting competitive advantage, then the knowledge about and promoting of what motivates them to work should be of significant importance for the organization [18]. An important role in this aspect of Sustainable HRM is played by: Work–life balance, autonomy, self-development, and a balanced career. An example of the latter will be used to study the psychological aspect of Sustainable HRM. A balanced career is different from the traditional career path, as 20th century enterprises mostly applied the economic paradigm in management.

The new career model, based on the idea of careers as actions, as means of learning, and as boundary-less entities, has replaced the prior model of careers as structures, as means of earning, and as constrained entities. This new concept of career has gained the name of a balanced career. Its source lies in the more commonly used concept of human sustainability.

An exemplary definition was provided by Carl Holling, who defined human sustainability as: “the capacity to create, test and maintain adaptive capability” [49] (p. 390). Holling’s definition is related to the operationalization of the concept of employability by Van der Heijde and Van der Heijden and reads: “The capacity of continuously fulfilling, acquiring or creating of work through the optimal use of competences” [50] (p. 453). The latter suggests an important responsibility of the individual employee in creating, testing, and maintaining his or her own work capacity or ability. On a similar note, Oldham and Hackman [51] stressed the increasing importance of personal initiative of workers to successfully progress or adjust one’s work capacity or ability across time by shaping or customizing their jobs in order to protect their sustainability at work (for example, via job crafting) [52].

In the view of the above, the concept of sustainable careers could be perceived as ‘sequences of job opportunities that go beyond the boundaries of single employment settings’ [53].

The sociological approach aims to make HRM activities more of a social practice. The interests and commitment of the three elements—the employee, the employer, and the society—are closely related in this perspective. Issues such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) or social issues such as employee diversity, age, gender, nationality or ethnicity, disability, etc. are of great importance in this approach.

Socially responsible human resource management manifests itself in the treatment of employees as important stakeholders of the enterprise [54]. Diversity management will be used to study the social aspect of Sustainable HRM.

Diversity is often defined as any significant difference that distinguishes one individual from another—a description that encompasses a broad range of overt and hidden qualities. Researchers classify diversity characteristics into four areas:

- Personality (traits, skills and abilities),
- internal (gender, race, ethnicity, IQ, sexual orientation),
- external (culture, nationality, religion, marital or parental status), and
- organizational (position, department, union/non-union) [54].

Organizational policies formulated to manage diversity aim to implement initiatives, activities, and practices that recognize, promote, or encourage the differences between groups or people. These elements are seen as positive values that warrant development to achieve social integration, which can also boost productivity of the company and support the democratization of access to opportunities [55].

Diversity means the dissimilarity, variety, and individuality that emerges from various differences between people. Diversity of individual abilities, experiences, competencies, and qualifications of human resources contributes to the success factor in organizations, which enables entrepreneurial strategies of increasing flexibility and continuous learning. Managing Diversity is more than a scheme. It is an attitude and a new understanding of how enterprises function and how to manage human resources in a sustainable way. Creating and applying effective diversity management concepts is one of the main challenges in modern organizations [56].

Human resource management involves planning, integration, and actions to achieve effective management of all employees. Diversity can be included in the set of human management practices, guaranteeing an alignment between the strategies of human resources and diversity management goals.

The ecological perspective concerns those aspects of HRM that can help make an organization “greener” (environmentally-friendly). This includes activities such as employee training in sustainable development or stimulation of pro-environmental behaviours that create employee competences. The wide spectrum of the definition of “green” HRM is shown in Table 1.

Employees, employers, customers, and regulatory stakeholders can be stimulants of green HRM. The literature also indicates three strategies used by employers to stimulate green behaviour [61]. They are as follows:

1. Mobilizing employees to implement sustainability in basic operations and at every stage and level of their business;
2. Holding employees accountable for applying sustainable practices in their work and encouraging them to further such practices in pay incentives;
3. Equipping employees with tools and training them to develop for further improvements.

The authors focusing on the issue of “green” HRM point to a number of ecological practices that can be applied in the area of human resource management at all individual stages of the human resource process [62] as:

- Including tasks related to environmental protection in job descriptions,
- Taking into account green competences as a component of the requirements profile at each workplace,
- Preference in the recruitment and selection process of candidates with competences and experience in implementing ecological projects,
- Encouraging the development of “green” competences and offering environmental training for employees and managers,
- Inclusion of ecological criteria in the periodic assessment of employees,
- Sharing knowledge in relation to environmental initiatives and programs and rewarding for their implementation, and
- Encouraging ecological behaviour during the performance of professional tasks (i.e., limiting the use of paper in the office, waste segregation).

An element of green HRM is also creating a green workplace called “green collars”. These are positions that help reduce the negative impact on the natural environment by improving the ecological quality of products, services, and technological processes [61].

Green HR practices should be implemented in a precisely planned HR strategy as part of the overall strategy concept. It is also important to study the company’s strategy and culture, because they determine the effectiveness and efficiency of green HRM.

The strategic perspective of Sustainable HRM explores the links between sustainable and strategic HRM. This approach highlights the impact that sustainable HRM has on traditional HR spheres, such

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

as recruitment and selection, employee rotation, aspects of evaluation, and employment opportunities within the organization. The task of HR is to achieve organizational goals that not only bring monetary benefits [19]. The main assumptions of this approach are the belief that people create a lasting competitive advantage and that achieving it enables sustainable management of human resources. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that related policies are still under review and analysis.

The Human Resource Planning Society defines five key knowledge areas for HR practitioners [22]:

- HR strategy and planning,
- leadership development,
- talent management,
- organizational effectiveness, and
- building a strategic HR function.

Losey et al. [63] described numerous opportunities in the realm of sustainability for HR to bring important operational competencies and to exert strategic leadership.

The model presented in Figure 1 will be verified in an empirical study relating to enterprises in Podlasie. To this end, the main hypothesis was formulated and adopted. It reads as follows: In enterprises operating in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, there is a relationship between the use of sustainable development practices by HR departments and their introduction to the company’s development strategy. The main hypothesis will be verified in a following empirical study.

# 2. Materials and Methods

# 2.1. Research Area and Research Population

The location of the research and selection of the research sample is purposeful, as the Podlaskie Voivodeship, located in the north-eastern part of Poland, is unique in the scale of the country in the perspective of natural, social, and economic scale. Its character is determined by areas of natural value. The legally protected areas with special natural values are built of the total area of national parks, nature reserves, landscape parks, protected landscape areas, documentation stands, ecological lands, and nature and landscape complexes. Taking into account the entire area of NATURA 2000, at least 40% of the area of the Podlaskie Voivodeship is covered by some form of nature protection. Those are unique places, on a European scale, barely changed by human activity.

Podlaskie Voivodeship, compared to other regions in Poland, is the least industrialized. Its share in domestic industrial production is only about 1.7%.

The main sectors of the economy of the Podlaskie Voivodeship are also closely related to the specificity of the region, which is characterized by high air quality and rich natural resources, used.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

# 2.1. Economic Sectors of the Podlaskie Voivodeship

The main sectors of the economy of the Podlaskie Voivodeship are also closely related to the specificity of the region, which is characterized by high air quality and rich natural resources, used in a sustainable way. Branches of the Podlaskie Voivodeship, in which the region has above average potential, include:

- Agri-food sector and sectors connected with it by the value chain,
- metal and machine industry, boatbuilding, and sectors related to it by the value chain,
- medical sector and life sciences and sectors related to it by the value chain, and
- eco-innovation, environmental sciences, and sectors related to it by the value chain (including renewable energy sources, resource-efficient construction, and efficient wood processing).

The Podlasie region is also unique in terms of culture and religions. For centuries, Podlasie served as both a political and national border, where the Polish, Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian ethnos intertwined. Companies in the Podlaskie Voivodeship operate in a religious plurality which stems from the area’s location and history. Its multinational character provided a solid background for the creation of distinct systems of values and attitudes. Podlasie is one of the most religiously diverse regions in Poland. The Catholic and Orthodox congregations constitute 77% and 13.5% of all inhabitants of Podlaskie Voivodeship, respectively (in some districts, for example in the Hajnowski district, over 80% of the inhabitants are Orthodox Church believers).

The research was conducted on a group of 73 participants of MBA studies at the Janski University in Łomża, one of the three centres of economic life in the region. The research included students of two editions of the studies—2019 and 2020. The study group is dominated by men (66%) and people with over 10 years of work experience (53%). All participants acquired higher education, which is a formal requirement for candidates for MBA studies.

# 2.2. Research Tool

The technique of a survey was used. The research tool was constructed on the basis of a questionnaire used on Dutch company managers with regards to the application of sustainable human resource management. It consists of a record and 24 statements relating to four aspects of sustainable human resource management (6 for each aspect): Social, psychological, environmental, and strategic.

The type and intensity of activities related to diversity management (social aspect) were identified on the basis of six statements concerning undertaking activities for older workers (1), various age groups (2), people with disabilities (3), various cultural groups (4), religious groups (5), and women (6).

The psychological aspect (the possibility for an employee to pursue a sustainable professional career) was diagnosed on the basis of 6 statements claiming that: Employees are treated as a key resource of the organization (1), they are provided with a job consistent with their interests and talents (2), coaching (3) and professional development (4) are available, the company covers the costs of training (5), and monitors the progress in employee behaviour towards sustainable development (6).

Inclusion of ecological issues in human resource management by enterprises was diagnosed on the basis of the assessment of statements concerning: The company’s taking into account the pro-ecological attitudes of job candidates (1) and during employee assessment (2), using public transport by employees (3) and compensating employees for their costs resulting from this (4), the use of ecological cars by the company (5), as well as the company’s canteen offering organic food (6).

Activities reflecting the strategic aspect related to the practice and introduction of Sustainable HRM to the company’s strategy were diagnosed on the basis of the following statements: The HR department is involved in creating a sustainable development policy (1), the HR department has introduced sustainability into the company’s action plan (2), the HR department has financial resources and human capital to initiate and promote actions for sustainability (3), declarations of respondents that they see the benefits of taking initiatives for sustainability (4) and their organization could be considered a model in this respect (5), and sustainability is an opportunity for the HR department.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

to prove its strategic position in the company (6). It can be stated that these statements relate to the conscious (4 and 6) and behavioural (1, 2, 3, 5) aspects.

The responses were scaled using the seven-point Likert scale, on the basis of which the respondents assessed whether the action described in the statement was carried out in their company. The extreme values of the scale are “definitely no” (1) and “definitely yes” (7). The Cronbach’s alpha for the individual scales of the questionnaire is: 0.87; 0.87; 0.84; 0.89.

The statements included in the questionnaire made it possible to answer the questions of whether and what activities for Sustainable HRM are undertaken, according to the respondents, in their companies, and what is the relationship between activities undertaken by HR departments in the area of diversity management (social aspect), enabling the development of sustainable professional career (psychological aspect) as well as promoting pro-ecological behaviour (ecological aspect) and strategic HR activities. The answer to the above questions also allowed us to verify the research hypothesis.

# 2.3. Selection and Application of Statistical Methods

In the first step, the skewness of the distributions was calculated (Tables 1–4). The absolute value of the obtained results was interpreted as follows [66]: 0–0.2 very weak asymmetry (distribution close to symmetric); 0.2–0.4 weak distribution asymmetry; 0.4–0.6 asymmetry of distribution strong; above 0.8, the asymmetry of distribution is very strong. As in most of the statements, the distributions of the answers were asymmetric and the skewness coefficient ranged from moderate to very strong, the calculation of the arithmetic mean and standard deviations was omitted in favour of median and mode. The basis for drawing conclusions about the implementation by the company’s HR department of individual types of activities in the field of sustainable development was the analysis of the distribution of answer variants given by the respondents (Figures 1–4). It was assumed that the selection of the answers “rather yes” (5), “yes” (6), and “definitely yes” (7) proves that the HR department undertook such actions, and selecting the answers “definitely no” (1), “no” (2), “probably not” (3), and “don’t know” (4) suggest that no such action is taken. On this basis, it was determined whether and what activities related to diversity management, building a sustainable professional career for employees, and shaping pro-ecological attitudes are practised in enterprises represented by MBA course students, and what activities related to sustainable human resource management are introduced by the HR department to the company’s strategy. The relationship between taking actions related to the social, psychological, and environmental aspects in the area of HRM and the strategic aspect was calculated using the Spearman correlation coefficient. The obtained absolute values of the correlation coefficient were interpreted as follows [67]: r < 0.3, weak correlation; r < 0.5, moderate correlation; up to r < 0.7, high correlation; to r < 0.9, very high correlation; r < 1, the correlation is almost complete. In order to find out which variables (dimensions) significantly explain the shaping of the variables that make up the strategic aspect, regression models (multiple regression) were constructed. The calculations were made using the Statistica TIBCO 13.3 statistical package.

# Figure 2. The social aspect—undertaking activities for the benefit of various groups of employees.

Activities that make up the diversity management in an organization are practiced in at least some enterprises. When assessing individual statements on a seven-point scale, the respondents rarely chose the extreme answers (1 and 7) and the middle answer (4).

In the case of statements 1, 2, 3, and 6, more than half of the respondents indicated that actions for specific groups of employees are undertaken in their enterprises (median 5). They concern activities for older workers, various age groups, people with disabilities, and women. In three groups, the mode was 6 (answer “yes”). On the other hand, when assessing activities for various cultural (statement 4) and religious (statement 5) groups, less than half (slightly more than 1/3) of respondents indicated that they were undertaken in their enterprises. The median was 4 and 3, respectively, and the mode was 3.

# 3.1.2. The Psychological Aspect

Detailed results concerning the possibility of pursuing a sustainable professional career by employees (psychological aspect) are presented in Table 3 and Figure 3.

According to the respondents, their enterprises undertake activities enabling them to pursue a sustainable professional career. This applies in particular to creating opportunities for professional development (statement 4), incurring related costs by the company (statement 5), and treating employees.

as a key resource of the organization (statement 1). In each of these statements, the distributions are strongly asymmetric (left-sided asymmetry—the percentage of affirmative answers is over 85%) and the median and mode were 6. The number of people choosing the affirmative answer definitely prevailed (78%) in the assessment of statement 2, concerning providing employees with work in line with their interests and talents, as well. However, the mode and median in the assessment of this statement were equal to 5, which means that at least half of the respondents answered “rather yes”. It was also the most frequently given answer. In the assessment of statements 3 (providing employees with coaching) and 6 (monitoring employees’ progress in behaviours for sustainable development), yes also prevailed (59% each), however, the asymmetry in the distribution of responses is smaller, and the most frequently chosen answer was “rather yes”—mode 5. When assessing practices used in the field of sustainable career development, the respondents rarely chose the extremely negative answer (only statements 5 and 6—4 and 3%, respectively) or the middle answer (from 0 to 13%).

# Figure 4. The ecological aspect—undertaking practices enabling employees to develop pro-ecological behaviours.

The analysis of the results shows a right-hand asymmetry of the distribution of variants of answers to most questions (except statement 3). The respondents most often stated that the pro-ecological practices indicated in the questionnaire were not undertaken in their enterprises or that they had a problem with an unambiguous response to particular statements (answer “hard to say”). Mode in all statements (except for 3) is 2 (answer “no”). Positive answers (from “rather yes” to “definitely yes”) did not prevail in the assessment of any of the statements.

The respondents most often (42%) indicated that employees in their enterprises use public transport to travel to work (statement 3). According to the respondents, the least frequently used practice (15% of positive answers) was compensating employees for the costs of commuting to work by public transport. Less than 1/3 of the respondents stated that their enterprise takes into account ecological criteria both at the stage of recruitment and employee evaluation.

Figure 5. The strategic aspect—practising and introducing Sustainable HRM to the company’s strategy.

In the evaluation of all statements, except for statement 2, the variants with the answer “yes” dominated (from 65 to 85% of responses). The evaluation of statements 4 and 6 concerning the consciousness aspect was higher than the others, as evidenced by a very high value of skewness coefficients as well as a median and a mode of 6.

When assessing the activities related to the implementation of Sustainable HRM into the company’s strategy, the majority of respondents declared that they were undertaken in terms of statements 1, 3, and 5. The median in each of them was 5, i.e., half of the respondents indicated at least the answer “rather yes”. However, the detailed distribution of answer variants differed. The most frequently chosen variant in statement 1 was “yes”, in statement 5 “rather yes”, and in statement 3 the distribution of answers was bimodal—the most common answers were “rather yes” and “yes”.

The weakest asymmetry of the distribution and the lowest median were observed in the assessment of statement 2 (introducing sustainability into the company’s action plan). The median was 4, and affirmative answers were slightly less than half of the total (48%). At the same time, a high percentage (21%) of respondents had a problem with an unambiguous assessment of this statement, thus selecting the middle value on the scale.

# 3.2. Correlations between the Strategic, Social, Psychological, and Ecological Aspects

The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between the statements making up the strategic aspect and the variables making up the social, psychological, and ecological aspects are presented in Table 6.

Empty fields in the table indicate no correlation or weak correlations, which were not included in the analysis.

All the observed correlations between the individual statements that make up the strategic aspect and the others are positive, most often moderate, and strong in several cases. The highest number of correlations was observed between the strategic and psychological aspects, and the least—between the strategic and environmental ones.

# 3.2.1. The Strategic Aspect and the Social Aspect

Strong correlations were observed between strategic statements 2 and 5 (“HR has introduced sustainability into the company’s action plan”; “I think my organization could be a model for other organizations when it comes to promoting sustainability activities”) and social statements 1 and 2 (actions for older workers and different age groups), as well as between strategic statement 4 (“I see benefits for the company from taking initiatives for sustainability”) and the social statement 1. The other observed correlations are moderate.

# 3.2.2. The Strategic Aspect and the Psychological Aspect

Correlations exist between most of the statements that make up both the strategic and psychological aspects. A strong positive relationship was observed between statements 4–6 of the strategic aspect (noticing the benefits of taking actions for sustainability, the organization can be a model in this field, an opportunity for the HR department to raise its strategic position) and the psychological statement 1 (treating employees as a key resource in the organization), between strategic statements 4 and 6 and psychological statement 5 (covering the costs of training by the company) and between strategic statements 5 and 6 and psychological statements 6 (monitoring employees’ progress in sustainable development behaviour). The remaining observed correlations are of moderate strength.

# 3.2.3. The Strategic Aspect and the Ecological Aspect

Out of the 6 statements that make up the strategic aspect, only 3 correlate with selected statements that make up the ecological aspect. The strength of the correlation is weak to moderate. Strategic statement 1 (involvement of the HR department in creating sustainable development policy) is correlated with statements 1–3 and 5–6 that make up the ecological aspect. Strategic statement 2 (introducing sustainability into a company’s action plan) correlates with environmental statements 1–4, and strategic statement 5 (organization as a model for promoting sustainability activities) with environmental statements 1 and 2.

Summarizing the analysis of the correlation between the strategic aspect of Sustainable HRM and the social, psychological, and ecological aspect, one can observe an emerging tendency that correlations occur more often and with greater power between these variants of answers, constituting particular aspects in which enterprises take specific actions, which confirms the usefulness of the adopted research model.

# 3.3. Multiple Regression of the Strategic Aspect in Relation to the Social, Psychological, and Ecological Aspects

In order to establish the relationship between the variables forming the individual Sustainable HRM dimensions, regression models were constructed. Six regression models, in which the dependent variables were individual questions concerning the strategic aspect, while the independent variables were questions concerning the social, psychological, and ecological aspect, were examined. Regression models for dependent variables strategic (i − 1,..., 6) are described by the equation:

STi = α0 + ∑αj ∗ SOj + ∑αj+6 ∗ Pj + ∑αj+12 ∗ Ej

where ST—Strategic; SO—Social; P—Psychological; E—Ecological.

The normality of the rest of the regression model was checked in each case. Based on the scattering plots of the model residuals with respect to the predicted residuals, it was concluded that the residuals were homoscedastic and non-correlated, and the existence of outliers in the model was checked on the basis of Cook’s distance. Analysis of the PLOTS of predicted residual values for all models showed that they are constructed correctly. The residuals in the model have normal distributions, and residual homoscedasticity is present. Cook’s distance analysis also shows that there are no outliers in the individual models.

The only significant variable that influences the Strategic Aspect 1 is the Psychological 3 aspect of providing employees with coaching. R2 in the model is 0.55, and the p-value in Fisher’s significance test is 0.00011.

The Strategic aspect 2 is influenced by the Social aspect 1. The Fisher test shows that the model is statistically significant, with p-value 0.00011 and R2 for the model 0.55.

The factor with a statistically significant impact on the Strategic aspect 3 is the Ecological aspect 3. The model as a whole is statistically significant, as evidenced by the p-value in the Fisher test p = 0.0052. R2 in the model is 0.45.

In model 4, the factors significantly influencing the Strategic 4 variable are the Psychological 1, Psychological 4, Psychological 5, and Ecological 1 aspects, where the p-value in Fisher’s significance test is p < 0.0000 and R2 is 0.69.

In the regression model 5, the Strategic 5 variable is significantly influenced by Social 1 and Psychological 6 aspects. R2 in the model is 0.61, while the p-value in the model significance test is 0.0001.

In the last constructed regression model, the Strategic 6 variable is significantly influenced by the Psychological 1 and Psychological 4 variables. R2 in the model is 0.57, while the p-value in the Fisher significance test is 0.0003.

To sum up, there were 18 independent variables (Social 1–6, Psychological 1–6, Ecological 1–6) analysed. The dependent variables (Strategic 1–6) are influenced by 11 independent ones. Ten of them explain well how only one aspect is developing. On the other hand, Social 1 explains well the shaping of two aspects (strategic 2 and 5). Moreover, the Psychological 4 aspect explains well the shaping of Strategic 4 and 6 aspects.

# 4. Conclusions and Discussion

The research model adopted in this research has been positively verified, indicating the dual role of the HR department in taking actions in the field of diversity management and developing a sustainable career as well as introducing those actions into the organization’s strategy.

On the basis of the conducted analysis, it can be concluded that in the surveyed companies, there are moderate and strong correlations between taking actions for various groups of employees and sustainable career development and their introduction to the company’s strategy. Additionally, on the basis of the constructed regression models, it was determined which of the analysed aspects (variables creating the social, psychological, and ecological aspect) significantly affect the strategic aspect. Thus, the adopted research model turned out to be useful in relation to the study of the relationship between the social, psychological, and ecological aspect and the strategic aspect, pointing to the dual role of HR departments. The adopted research model also allowed us to indicate which activities, to the greatest extent, contribute to increasing the effectiveness of HR departments in realizing Sustainable HRM endeavours.

When analysing the results obtained in terms of particular aspects of HRM, it can be noticed that they often relate to activities resulting from the existing legal solutions. This applies, inter alia, to activities undertaken for the benefit of various employee groups. By law, elderly, adolescent, disabled, and women employees are entitled to special protection.

In terms of solutions related to the development of a sustainable professional career of employees, attention should be paid to the economic interest of the organization and certain customary solutions. In recent years, the labour market in Poland has taken on the character of an employee’s market. Due to the difficulty of obtaining qualified employees, employers were forced to incur greater expenditure on employee training.

Podlasie is a relatively poor region. This also applies to companies operating there. This is the most likely explanation for the lack of results indicating the undertaking of pro-ecological activities included in the study. The purchase of green cars or subsidies for employees using public transport are additional costs, which may comprise an impossible barrier for many companies. An additional problem arises in the use of public transport by employees. Some of the smaller towns have rather poor infrastructure and transportation connection, and using their own means of transport is often the only possible means to travel to work. Regarding the statement about organic food offered in canteens, two factors may have influenced the distribution of the response value. Some enterprises, especially smaller ones, may not have their own canteens. Secondly, certified organic food is more expensive than non-organic, which can also be a barrier for companies.

The results of this part of the research are not unique, as research conducted among Finnish top managers showed that, contrary to the prior green HRM literature, ecological responsibility was largely ignored [34]. Finland, like Poland, has a restrictive legal system with regard to environmental protection, and this may mean that the environmental aspect has automatically become part of the mentality of Finnish companies. Podlaskie is a region whose land is mostly categorized as Natura 2000 areas. This means that entrepreneurs are obliged now to respect strict environmental protection standards. Consequently, it is likely that they are convinced that their compliance with applicable legal norms meets their environmental obligations. However, this is a hypothesis that should be verified in further research.

On the other hand, another possible explanation for the low environmental aspect correlation can be attributed to the historic disregard for environmental matters. There is a limited amount of

research conducted so far covering the environmental problems in Central Europe. Š. Waisova [68] considered environmental governance in the Visegard Group (V4). The group includes four Central European countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and The Czech Republic. The Visegrad countries have a common communist heritage. All were previously regimes with an economic emphasis on the metallurgic industry, mining, and intensive centralized agriculture. Environmental protection and the interest in environmental changes and threats were very low on the priority list for many years in those countries. Because of their geopolitical situation, history, and physical geography, Poland and Hungary in particular are linked to environmental issues that go beyond Central Europe and call for far wider environmental action. Perhaps partially due to the historical footprint, Polish organizations might correlate the lowest with the environmental aspect. However, this hypothesis should be verified in further research.

Existing research on Sustainable HRM includes research by K. Piwowar-Sulej [69] on the development of future competencies of industrial engineers in Poland. This group is responsible for the implementation of Industry 4.0 concept and cleaner production in the country. As K. Piwowar-Sulej’s research suggests, industrial companies in Poland tend to be short-sighted when developing the potential of their engineers. The author concludes that the HR development practices focus mainly on current and ongoing needs, there is a lack of employee participation in the process of making training-related decisions, and the environmental sustainability remains a neglected area of knowledge in terms of training. This also could be one of the factors contributing to the low correlation to the environmental aspect in this research.

Other existing research relates to the role of HR department managers and was done by K. Drela [32]. The results of her research confirmed that HR managers of enterprises operating in the area of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship play a very active role in managing the initiatives related to sustainable development, and in introducing sustainability measures into corporate strategies. The results obtained by K. Drela further confirm and strengthen the role of HR in Corporate Sustainability.

As existing research results are not coherent, it seems worth consulting a wider-group research, encompassing varied employee groups and industry sectors to obtain a more comprehensive view on a national scale.

The limitations of the research group were also a limitation for this research. The research group represented only a part of the organizations operating in Podlasie. Furthermore, the research group was comprised of MBA students only. Hence, it encompassed only some members of the HR departments of the researched organizations. Therefore, one of the further research ideas include conducting the research with a bigger research group of Podlasie companies, and thus creating a more complete database for the country.

Moreover, further research could also focus on other regions within the country to contribute to a wider data collection. The research model created in this research has wide applications, as it can be used in research without geographical limitations. It can also be utilized in varied sectors (public or business) and branches of the economy. What is more, the research in particular regions could be repeated on a regular basis. The results thereof could serve as the basis for following the process of Corporate Sustainability implementation.

# Abstract

Financial market information can provide an objective assessment of losses anticipated from temperature changes. In an APT model in which temperature shocks are a systematic risk factor, the risk premium is significantly negative, loadings for most assets are negative, and asset portfolios in more vulnerable industries have stronger negative loadings on a temperature shock factor. Weighted average increases in the cost of equity capital attributed to uncertainty about temperature changes are 0.22 percent, implying a present value loss of 7.92 percent of wealth. These costs represent a new channel that may contribute to cost of climate change assessment.

# 1. Introduction

We examine to what extent temperature shocks affect the cost of equity. If temperature fluctuations are uncertain and systematically affect cash flows, temperature shocks could represent a priced Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) risk factor, resulting in increases in expected returns. Higher expected returns mean a higher cost of capital to firms, which can have a profound and adverse impact on economic growth (Henry, 2003). To study empirically whether temperature shocks are a priced APT factor, we follow the empirical asset-pricing literature (e.g. Vassalou, 2003; Kapadia, 2011). We find that the average cost of equity capital is 0.22.

1 Our investigation is motivated by substantial uncertainty in temperature variation, which can be illustrated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s widely quoted estimates for the increase in the global mean temperature. IPCC’s range for the possible increase of global mean surface temperature by the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) relative to the 1986–2005 period is vast: from 0.3°C to 4.8°C (IPCC, 2014). Kamstra, Kramer and Levi (2003) examine how temperature affects human mood and investor behavior, but not from the climate change perspective. Fankhauser and Tol (2005) study the impact of climate change on capital accumulation, but not from the cost-of-capital perspective. Brunner (2002) analyzes the effects of the El Niño weather cycle on commodity prices and economic activity but does not consider the cost of capital. Previous finance literature has examined the interaction between weather and financial markets. For instance, Roll (1984) and Fleming et al. (2006) study how weather-related information affects, respectively, mean returns and return variances in particular weather-sensitive markets, and Hirshleifer and Shumway (2003) consider how weather impinges on returns by affecting trader attitudes. These studies focus on higher-frequency (daily) weather events and subsequent return realizations. Our paper focuses on a very different aspect of the interaction between weather and financial markets: the impact of lower-frequency (monthly) weather events, relating to changing perceptions of the distribution of future temperatures, on systematic risk and the economy-wide cost of capital.

percentage points higher on an annual basis due to temperature shocks. Based on Henry’s (2003) finding of an approximate one-to-one relationship between the cost of capital and GDP per capita growth our results imply that temperature shocks cause a 0.22 percentage point reduction in the growth rate of U.S. GDP per capita. This estimate is statistically and economically significant.

A rapidly growing new climate-economy literature has drawn on exogenous temperature shocks to identify causal effects of high temperatures on production at both micro and macro levels, thereby uncovering widespread cash flow effects of temperature shocks. For instance, Fisher, Hanemann, Roberts, and Schlenker (2012) find a negative impact of high temperatures on U.S. agriculture. Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) show that temperature increases at the higher end of the distribution reduce labor productivity in sectors with high exposure to weather such as agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; mining; construction; transportation and utilities; and manufacturing. Cachon, Gallino, and Olivares (2012) find that high temperatures reduce productivity and automobile production at the plant level. There is also experimental evidence that high temperatures affect labor productivity (Seppänen, Fisk, and Lei, 2006). Dell, Jones and Olken (2012) in a world sample find that temperature increases reduce not only levels but also growth rates of real GDP, particularly in developing countries. We contribute to the new climate-economy literature by investigating if temperature shocks also have discount-rate effects.

Our results have important implications for climate change research. The extant climate change literature relies on a “damage function” to incorporate the effects of climate change on economic outcomes. The typical specification allows temperature variation to affect the level but

To put the number in perspective, the aggregate economic costs of mitigating secular increases in temperature (designed to limit climate change to below 2°C by the end of the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels) only amount to an annualized reduction of per capita consumption growth of 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points (IPCC, 2014). Earlier studies also document a negative cross-sectional relationship between temperature and income per capita (e.g., Nordhaus, 2006; Dell, Jones and Olken, 2009). See Dell, Jones and Olken (2014) for an excellent review of the new climate-economy literature.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

not the growth rate of output (Dell, Jones and Olken, 2014), which is inconsistent with the empirical evidence in the new climate-economy literature. Dell, Jones and Olken (2014) accordingly call for research to help understand the mechanisms underlying the temperature-growth relationship. The evidence in this paper identifies a specific mechanism through which temperature shocks impact growth. Temperature shocks have not only cash-flow but also discount-rate effects, and a large literature pioneered by Bagehot (1873) and Schumpeter (1911) shows theoretically and empirically that the cost of capital affects capital accumulation as well as innovation and productivity (e.g., King and Levine, 1993).

In a contemporaneous paper, Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) develop a long-run risks model focusing on temperature-induced disasters, and find that temperature shocks have a negative impact on asset prices. There are two major differences between Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) and the present paper. First, the underlying temperature-economy linkages are different. While temperature-induced disasters drive the negative impact of temperature variation in Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015), the impact in the present paper is the result of high temperatures emphasized by the new climate-economy literature. For instance, high temperatures without disasters could still reduce labor productivity and supply (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014), which may help explain the negative effects of temperature shocks in earlier years when temperature-induced disasters were insignificant. Second and more importantly, the perspectives differ. Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) do not disentangle the cash-flow and discount-rate effects. Given that cash-flow effects of temperature variation are well documented in the new climate-economy literature, we focus here on identifying the discount-rate effect of temperature shocks.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 states three testable hypotheses and briefly discusses the data. Section 3 presents the tracking portfolio approach of

constructing the temperature shock factor. Section 4 provides estimates of the loadings and the premium on the temperature shock factor. Section 5 investigates specifically the quantitative impact of temperature shocks on the cost of equity capital. Section 6 discusses further empirical results, and Section 7 concludes with a discussion of implications and a brief summary.

# 2. Hypotheses and data

Temperature shocks essentially act as a systematic negative productivity shock in the context of Balvers and Huang (2007). Since temperature shocks negatively affect most firms (i.e. the factor loadings on the temperature shock factor are generally negative), the risk premium must be negative to ensure that riskier assets have higher average returns.

# HYPOTHESIS 1.

The temperature shock factor has a significant and negative risk premium.

Temperature shocks may have an uneven impact. In particular, some sectors are more vulnerable: Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; mining; construction; transportation; and manufacturing, because these sectors have high exposure to climate (Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014). Furthermore, Quiggin and Horowitz (2003) emphasize adjustment costs to temperature changes. They argue that costs of adjustment arise if capital stocks: (i) are dependent on climate for their optimal location; and (ii) depreciate more slowly than is required to permit easy adjustment to a changing climate. Thus, firms with capital in place, value firms, should be more vulnerable. Along this line, small firms should be more sensitive to temperature shocks, because they may lack resources to adjust. If temperature shocks are truly a risk factor, the industries or firms that are more sensitive to temperature shocks should have higher loadings (in absolute value) on the temperature factor and, accordingly, higher required returns and costs of capital.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

# HYPOTHESIS 2

Industries or firms that are more vulnerable to temperature shocks have higher loadings (in absolute value) on the temperature shock factor. If suspicions of climate change have intensified in recent decades, the aggregate importance of temperature shocks ought to have risen. Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) substantiate that negative elasticity of asset prices to temperature fluctuations has been increasing over time, which motivates us to test the following hypothesis.

# HYPOTHESIS 3

The impact of the temperature shock factor on the average cost of equity capital increases over time. Dictated by data availability, our sample period starts in April 1953 and ends in May 2015. In terms of location, we limit ourselves to the United States, because the required temperature and financial-market data are available for the U.S. and are uniformly accurate. The portfolio returns and Fama-French factor data are from Kenneth French’s website. The macro variables data are from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The temperature is the U.S. average temperature series obtained from the National Climatic Data Center. In addition, we merge CRSP and Compustat to construct a variety of equity portfolios for empirical testing.

# Economic Tracking Portfolios: A Non-Structural Approach

To infer the news concerning future temperature variation contained in current stock returns, we employ the economic tracking portfolio approach proposed by Breeden, Gibbons, and Litzenberger (1989) and Lamont (2001) and previously applied by Vassalou (2003) and Kapadia (2011). This statistical approach allows us to estimate the risk premium of temperature shocks without imposing a particular model of asset pricing.

# 3.1. Primary specification

Our simple time-series model is essentially the daily temperature model of Campbell and Diebold (2005) amended to deal with monthly observations and to avoid seasonal adjustment:

Tt+12 = c + at + εt+12,

where Tt+12 is the average temperature from month t+1 to t+12, t is the deterministic time trend, and εt+12 captures effects of all other variables (emissions, climate policy, etc.). Tautologically, we can separate Tt+12 into a previously expected component, a news component, and noise:

Tt+12 = E-1(Tt+12) + ∆Et(Tt+12) + εt

where the news component is ∆Et(Tt+12) = E(Tt+12) - E-t(Tt+12), which is contained in the temperature observation in month t, and the noise component is εt+12 = Tt+12 - Et(Tt+12).

If temperature variation matters for asset pricing, innovations in excess returns of basis assets should reflect innovations in expectations about future temperature variation. That is,

∆Et(Tt+12) = b[Rt - E-1(Rt)] + εt,

where Rt - E-1(Rt) represents a column vector of unexpected excess returns, with Rt a column vector of excess returns of the basis assets in month t (i.e., returns net of the risk-free rate), and εt the component of news that is orthogonal to the unexpected excess returns of the basis assets.

Assume that the basis asset excess returns in month t are a linear function of Z1, a vector of conditioning economic variables known at t-1, and that Tt+12 is a linear function of...

See also Harvey (1989), Seater (1993), and Visser and Molenaar (1995). Our approach is agnostic about the extent to which unanticipated temperature shocks signal changes in climate. In the Web Appendix we show that five-year average temperature shocks in the U.S. are highly persistent in the period 1950-2014 with a coefficient of 0.70 (whereas this coefficient is 0.17 in the period from 1895-1950). This persistence may merely be indicative of temporary warming/cooling trends rather than permanent changes in climate. The importance of temperature shocks, however, definitely extends beyond the current period. Our approach isolates the changes in value of firms resulting from the temperature shocks, thus providing a discounted sum of the market-perceived impacts over time irrespective of whether these reflect transitory trends or permanent climate change.

Following the tracking portfolio literature, we focus on news concerning next year’s temperature variation. In our primary specification we follow Vassalou (2003) and use the six Fama-French size and book-to-market (BM) portfolios as the basis assets. To obtain the economic conditioning variables – the ZE1 in equation (4) – we again follow Vassalou (2003) and use macro variables known to predict equity returns. They are the risk-free rate (RF), the term premium (TERM) (the 10-year government bonds rate from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank minus the risk-free rate), and the default premium (DEF) (the yield difference between BAA and AAA bonds from the St. Louis Fed). We use the lagged average temperature over the past year (i.e., from t−12 to t−1) as the single climate control variable in ZC1.

The primary specification in Table 1 presents the construction and diagnostic tests of the tracking portfolios for the temperature shock factor based on equation (4) with the six Fama-French size-value portfolios as the basis assets and the macro variables used by Vassalou (2003) as conditioning variables. Because we use overlapping data, the t-ratios are obtained from Newey-West HAC standard errors with the bandwidth (lag parameter) set equal to 24.7.

All results are for 1953:5 - 2014:5 (we lose 1953:4 because we employ a one-month lagged term premium and our term premium data start in 1953:4. We also lose the 2014:6-2015:5 period which is required for the final sample point of T+12). The coefficient estimates in Panel A indicate that SL (small growth firms) and SH (small value firms) have significant tracking ability, positive and negative, respectively, for future temperature changes. The signs and significance of these coefficients are as expected: Growth firms may potentially benefit from temperature variation as they do not yet have their capital in place (SL coefficient > 0). Value firms face adjustment costs, as implied by Quiggin and Horowitz (2003), since their capital is already in place.

7 The bandwidth exceeds the data overlap interval as suggested by Sun, Phillips, and Jin (2008). Following Bekaert and Hoerova (2014) we set the bandwidth equal to Max[3, 2*horizon] which is 24 in the case with annual horizon.

# Alternative Specification 2

We avoid the specifics of the temperature trend model of Campbell and Diebold (2005) by assuming instead a stochastic trend model of temperature with unknown drift term to identify the tracking portfolio. Estimate the following model over the entire sample:

TGRTH+12 = c + eZE1 + gZC1 + bRt + tt−12 (4b)

where TGRTH+12 = 100 × log(Tt+1,t+12/Tt-11,t) is the log difference in the average annual temperature. The variables are the same as in the benchmark specification: Rt = (SL, SM, SH, BL, BM, BH)′; ZE1 = (RF−1, DEF−1, TERM−1); ZC1 is the lagged growth rate in the average temperature; and the temperature shock factor is the tracking portfolio return TSF = bRt.

# Alternative Specification 3

We avoid the tracking portfolio approach altogether in favor of a standard two-pass approach with specific risk corrections based on the CAPM and the Fama-French three-factor model, using unexpected temperature changes as the temperature shock factor. Estimate the following model in a rolling fashion (for each month s we estimate for the months s-120 to s-1) to avoid using future information; generate an error term es using the 10 years of data preceding month s so that for each month only the residual for the last month of the following regression is utilized to serve as the unexpected temperature change:

Tmt = C + A⋅t + Σi=110 Siseasonali + LTm + et−i (4c)

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

where Ttm represents the monthly temperature, t is the deterministic time trend, seasonali is the seasonal dummy variable for month i. The lag length is selected by the Schwartz-Bayes Criterion.

Then we calculate the expected temperature based on the estimated parameters. The temperature shock factor is the unexpected change in the monthly temperature, TSF* = ett (the asterisk indicates that the temperature shock factor is not a tradable asset in this case).

The specifics of the tracking portfolios generated by the first and second robustness approaches (ALT1 and ALT2) are in Table 1 (the third approach does not use a tracking portfolio). Panel B in this table illustrates that the mean tracking portfolio return continues to be robustly significantly negative for the alternative set of basis assets and the different trend specification for temperatures.

# 4. Standard Asset Pricing Models: Structural Approaches

The tracking portfolio approach of Lamont (2001) in Section 3 estimates the risk premium of the temperature shock factor without specifying an equilibrium asset-pricing model. In this section, we supplement these results by estimating the risk premium of temperature shocks within the standard multi-factor models. This approach enables us to obtain the sensitivities to the temperature shock factor of particular industries/firms, to address Hypothesis 2, and to identify the aggregate quantitative impact on the cost of equity capital and how this impact changes over time, to address Hypothesis 3.

and the Sharpe-Lintner CAPM. These are the most common systematic risk models. For our asset-pricing specifications, we take the Fama-French (1996) three-factor model temperature shock factor is added to these specifications as an additional factor. If temperature shock impacts are adverse, we expect to find negative loadings for typical firms or portfolios and a negative risk premium to compensate for the additional risk. The impact of temperature shocks.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

On the average cost of capital can naturally be measured by the product of the premium and the average loading of assets on the temperature shock factor.

We use the Black-Jensen-Scholes (1972) / Fama-MacBeth (1973) two-pass methodology – estimating factor sensitivities in the first pass, and using these to obtain risk premia in the second pass – with standard refinements: the Shanken (1992) correction to obtain errors-in-variables-robust standard errors, accounting for the fact that factor sensitivities are estimated, and the Shanken and Zhou (2007) correction to generate misspecification-robust standard errors.

Lewellen, Nagel and Shanken (2010) argue that using as test assets only size–BM portfolios, as is common in the empirical asset-pricing literature, can be highly misleading due to the strong factor structure of these portfolios. They propose to expand the set of test assets to include other portfolios, such as industry portfolios. Including industry portfolios is particularly attractive for our research since the climate-economy literature has predictions for how different industries should be affected. We thus use 55 size-value and industry portfolios (25 size-value portfolios plus 30 industry portfolios) as our test assets, instead of just 25 size-value portfolios.

Since temperature variation is a systematic risk, we expect to see that the temperature shock factor is priced and that its premium is negative. The results based on the primary specification for constructing the temperature shock factor are reported in Table 2. The first-pass results for each of the four models: CAPM, the Fama-French model (FF), the CAPM plus the temperature shock factor (CAPM+TSF), and the Fama-French model plus the temperature shock factor (FF+TSF) are similar. In each case, the GRS test rejects the model. The second-pass results reveal that the risk premium for the temperature shock factor is significantly negative as predicted. The model has a higher average cross-sectional R-square when the temperature shock factor is included in the Fama-MacBeth regressions. The premium estimates of -0.01 percent.

(Chems), Textiles (Txtls), Steel Works (Steel), Fabricated Products and Machinery (FabPr),
Automobiles (Autos), Aircraft, Ships, and Railroad Equipment (Carry), and Business Supplies
and Shipping Containers (Paper) have significantly negative sensitivity, because they have high
exposure to climate as Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) suggest; Food Products (Food), Coal
(Coal), Utilities (Util), and four Manufacturing industries [Beer & Liquor (Beer), Tobacco
Products (Smoke), Consumer Goods (Hshld), and Electrical Equipment (ElcEq)] also have
negative sensitivity to the temperature shock factor, although not significant.

Recreation (Games), Wholesale (Whlsl), Retail (Rtail), and Tourism (Meals) are
significantly negatively affected by temperature shocks, possibly because temperature shocks
affect time allocation (for instance, Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) find that temperature
increases reduce time allocated to outdoor leisure); Banking, Insurance, Real Estate, Trading
(Fin) has a negative loading on the temperature shock factor, which may reflect the negative
impacts of temperature shocks on the real economy.

The loadings on the temperature shock factor are positive for only five industries, with
three of these significant: Health (Hlth), Services (Servs), and Business Equipment (BusEq). The
health industry has a small demand elasticity, and therefore may provide a good hedge against
negative supply shocks. Services have few long-lived capital assets. Business Equipment may
benefit from adjustment due to temperature fluctuations as this increases demand for its product.

To test Hypothesis 2 formally with the industry portfolios, we create two equal-weighted
portfolios. “High” includes the high-exposure sectors identified by Graff Zivin and Neidell
(2014) (specifically: agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; construction; mining; and
transportation and utilities; and manufacturing), while “Low” consists of the remaining sectors.
The loadings on the temperature shock factor for “High” and “Low” capture the average sensitivities of the

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

high-exposure and low-exposure sectors, respectively. Consequently, the loading on the temperature shock factor for “High – Low” picks up the sensitivity difference between the high- and low-exposure sectors. The time-series regressions for “High”, “Low” and “High – Low” are reported at the bottom of Panel A. The average loading on the temperature shock factor for the high-exposure sectors is -6.18 (t = -4.65), while that for the low-exposure sectors is -1.37 (t = -1.68). The sensitivity difference is -4.81 with a HAC-robust (Newey-West with 12 lags) t-statistic of -3.40. Thus, Hypothesis 2 is significantly supported for the 30 industry portfolios.

# Size and value portfolios

For the size- and value-sorted portfolios the conjectures are that: (1) value firms, which tend to have long-lived capital assets, are more sensitive to the temperature shock factor than growth firms, and (2) smaller firms, which may have less resources to adapt or to adjust, are more sensitive to the temperature shock factor than larger firms. The results for the 25 size- and BM-sorted portfolios in Panel B of Table 4 are consistent with these conjectures. For instance, the temperature shock sensitivities of the small-value portfolio and the small-growth portfolio are, respectively, -27.15 and -6.73, suggesting that value firms are more sensitive to temperature shocks; similarly, the temperature shock loadings of the small-value portfolios and the large-value portfolio are, respectively, -27.15 and -12.77, implying that small firms are more vulnerable to temperature shocks.

A more direct test, instead of obtaining loadings from the mimicking portfolio for temperature shocks – our primary specification of TSF from equation (4) – obtains loadings straight from the temperature shocks – alternative specification 3 (TSF* from equation 4c). As shown in the Web Appendix, the loadings of the sectors identified by Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) a priori as having the highest exposure to weather, have (equal-weighted) average loading of -4.52 to the temperature shocks measured based on equation (4c) whereas the remaining sectors have only slightly negative loading on these temperature shocks of -0.17. The difference is -4.35, which is marginally insignificant (bootstrapping p-value of 0.11 in a one-tailed test). The support for Hypothesis 2 is weaker here due to higher standard errors. This occurs because the raw temperature shocks contain less focused information about economically relevant future weather implications than is captured by the mimicking temperature factor portfolios. The weaker results illustrate the advantage of using tracking portfolios rather than raw temperature shocks.

# 5.2. Impact on the cost of equity

To test Hypothesis 2 formally for the size and BM portfolios, we again form equal-weighted portfolios to capture the average sensitivities of different types of stocks. “Small” consists of the five small-capitalization portfolios, and “Big” includes the five large-capitalization portfolios; “Value” contains the five value portfolios, and “Growth” comprises the five growth portfolios. “Small - Big” picks up the difference between small and big stocks, and “Value - Growth” does the same for value and growth stocks. The time-series regressions for the returns of these portfolios are reported at the bottom of Panel B. The average loading on the temperature factor for small stocks is -16.89 (t = -10.38), while for large stocks it is -2.80 (t = -3.17). The sensitivity difference between small and big stocks is -14.09 with a HAC-robust t-statistic of -6.51. The average loading on the temperature factor for value stocks is -21.40 (t = -29.29), while that for growth stocks is 1.64 (t = 1.40). The sensitivity difference between value and growth stocks is -23.04 with a HAC-robust t-statistic of -18.06. Thus, Hypothesis 2 is also strongly supported for the 25 size and BM portfolios.

The economy-wide average impact on the cost of equity capital is obtained by multiplying the temperature shock risk premium by the weighted average loading. We use the market value weights and loadings of the 55 industry- and size-value sorted portfolios. The weight is obtained by dividing the market value of each portfolio by the sum of the market values of the 55 portfolios. The loadings on the alternative versions of TSF are obtained as in Table 4 from the time-series regressions of portfolio returns on the appropriate factors for each model. The weighted averages of the loadings are multiplied by the risk premium (γ from Table 2 for the primary specification CAPM+TSF model, and Table 3 for the alternative TSF specifications) to find the average impact measure. Note that the step of multiplying the risk...

premium by the loadings is necessary because there is nothing in our approach that requires loadings to sum to one (as for market returns) or to zero (as for some factor mimicking portfolios).11

Panel A of Table 5 shows the total value-weighted impact. Using the CAPM plus TSF risk model the impact (the risk premium times the average temperature shock loading) is economically significant and has the same order of magnitude for each of the alternative TSF specifications. Numerically, the weighted average annual increase in the cost of equity capital from temperature shocks is 0.22 percent in the Primary specification, 0.23 percent for ALT1, 0.26 percent for ALT2, and 0.18 percent for ALT3.

To discover if Hypothesis 3 can be confirmed, we repeat the above exercise with rolling samples to find whether the impact of temperature shocks has increased from an early part of the test period to a later part. The risk premium at each time is estimated with 30 years of data to obtain meaningful estimates. As our earliest observation for the term premium is 1953 the test period starts in 1983. We update estimates monthly by dropping the earliest observation and adding the latest observation. Panel B of Table 5 shows the average impact based on the rolling estimates over two evenly divided sub-periods: 1983-1998 and 1999-2014. To properly evaluate the significance of the impact difference in the two subsample periods we use the approach of Cooper, Gutierrez, and Hameed (2004) which provides appropriate standard errors.

In the primary specification the average temperature shock impact in period 1983-1998 is a significantly positive 0.11 percent. The impact in the more recent period 1999-2014 is also significantly positive, but three times as large at 0.33 percent. The difference is clearly

11 The value-weighted average loadings present a proper market average (for the US stock market). Whereas, roughly, each firm is represented twice (once in the industries and once in the value-size sorted portfolios) the computation requires the value weights of the 55 portfolios to sum to one so that each firm’s market value is accurately reflected.

significantly positive. The results for the three alternative specifications are qualitatively identical, also showing a significant impact in both periods with a substantially larger impact in the second period.

The significant difference for the two intervals nominally confirms Hypothesis 3. To obtain more information about the path of the temperature shock impact over time, we present the specific time paths of the impact in Figure 2. These are quite consistent for the various specifications. A closer look at the time path of the impacts over time illustrates that the issues are not as simple as hypothesized. The evidence further confirms that temperature variation matters for asset pricing and that its impact is significantly positive and, until recently, has been growing over time as is consistent with Hypotheses 1 and 3. However, the impact estimate appears to decrease after 2004, which is not consistent with Hypothesis 3.

There are plausible explanations for the unexpected decrease in the impact estimate after 2004 that are consistent with the perspective of climate change risk. In particular:

1. The risk premium on the temperature shock factor may have declined because of reduced temperature risk. Indeed, as Panel E of Figure 2 shows, the standard deviation of temperature (30-year moving average of U.S. annual temperatures) displays a similar pattern as the time series of impact estimates in Panels A-D, and has started to decline after 2004.
2. The ability of firms to handle temperature fluctuations has improved as trading in weather derivatives has taken off dramatically since the turn of the century and adaptation may have been substantial in recent years.
3. It is naturally also possible that the time series after 2004 is too short to pick up a reliable trend, in contrast to our simple sample split, which did support Hypothesis 3 over the full data period.

# 6. Further discussion and robustness checks

# 6.1. Industry portfolios as basis assets

In this paper, we follow Vassalou (2003) and use the six Fama-French size and book-to-market (BM) portfolios as the basis assets to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio. However, as Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2010) imply, because size and BM portfolios have a strong factor structure, a factor with spurious correlation with the size and book-to-market factors could seem to carry a significant risk premium in standard asset-pricing tests. Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken (2010) suggest taking into account industry portfolios. In our case, previous studies (e.g., Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014) also suggest that particular sectors (e.g., construction, transportation, and manufacturing) are more vulnerable to temperature shocks. However, we should not expect climate sensitivity to be homogenous within an industry, because as we have pointed out size and value also matter. For instance, although temperature shocks affect labor supply and productivity, a large manufacturing firm (or a firm with less capital in place), relative to a small firm (or a firm with more capital in place), may be better able to mitigate the effects of temperature shocks by, for instance, installing more effective/advanced cooling systems. Thus, it may be more informative to use industry-size-value sorted portfolios, instead of just industry portfolios, to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio.

To avoid employing too many basis assets we adopt the Fama-French five-industry classification.12 For each of the five industries we use only the small-firm portfolios (small firms are more sensitive to climate changes) and distinguish between low-value and high-value firms (firms with fewer assets in place adjust more easily than those with more assets in place). In all

12 See http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html. The industries are Cnsmr (Consumer Durables, NonDurables, Wholesale, Retail, and Some Services -- Laundries, Repair Shops), Manuf (Manufacturing, Energy, and Utilities), HiTec (Business Equipment, Telephone and Television Transmission), Hlth (Healthcare, Medical Equipment, and Drugs), and Other (Other, Mines, Constr, BldMt, Trans, Hotels, Bus Serv, Entertainment, Finance).

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

We parsimoniously employ 10 industry-size-value portfolios (SL and SH in each industry) as the basis assets to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio, and report the results in Panel A of Table 6. Multicollinearity among even this diverse and relatively small group of 10 basis assets makes it difficult to interpret individual coefficients. However, the chi-square test cannot reject at the 5% level the hypothesis that the coefficients on the basis assets are jointly zero, indicating that the basis assets jointly have significant tracking ability. Furthermore, the mean return of the tracking portfolio is -0.03 with a t-statistic of -4.27, which is close to that based on the primary specification (i.e., using six size and BM portfolios as basis assets).

We repeat the time-series as well as cross-sectional tests with the newly constructed temperature shock tracking portfolio (TSF10), and report the results in Panels B and C of Table 6. The time-series tests show that not only do many of the test assets have significant exposure to the temperature shock factor, but also their exposure is consistent with the predictions of the climate-economy literature. For instance, value (high-BM) portfolios are negatively affected by temperature shocks. The cross-sectional test reveals that the temperature shock factor carries a significantly negative premium even in the presence of the market factor.

# 6.2. Bootstrapping simulation

In evaluating the significance of the risk premia in Panel C of Table 6 we consider errors-in-variables robust (Shanken, 1992) and misspecification-robust (Shanken and Zhou, 2007) standard errors.14 Jiang, Kan, and Zhan (2015) demonstrate that, even with these corrections, ignoring estimation error in factor mimicking portfolio weights can lead to an underestimation of...

As shown in the Web Appendix, employing only the five industry portfolios as the basis assets provides no significant tracking ability. In addition, we find considerable within-industry heterogeneity along the size and value dimensions. Nevertheless, holding size and BM constant, industry sensitivities differ substantially, indicating that temperature shocks are not merely relevant as spuriously related to size and BM.

The GMM-based standard errors employed in, among others, Vassalou (2003) and Aretz, Bartram, and Pope (2010) also adjust for errors in variables.

The standard errors of the estimated risk premia corresponding to these portfolios. To gauge if our results are robust to the estimation errors of the (factor mimicking) tracking portfolio, we carry out bootstrapping simulations for all instances involving tracking portfolios.

We randomly permute the time index for the market index returns (MKT) and the Temperature observations jointly. Then we run the tracking portfolio regression to create the TSF from equation (4). Subsequently, we find the loadings on MKT and TSF, and then the risk premia from the second pass cross-sectional regression on the mean returns of the 55 portfolios. We repeat this for 1000 random permutations of the time index for MKT and Temperature to generate the distribution of the estimated risk premia under the null hypothesis that the risk premia are zero. Panel C in Table 6 indicates that, with the 10 industry-size-value portfolios as basis assets, only 32 of the thousand simulations generate a TSF risk premium smaller than the obtained risk premium of -0.02. Thus, the one-sided p-value is 0.03 for the TSF risk premium (compared to p = 0.02 for the errors-in-variables and misspecification-robust approaches).

A similar bootstrapping procedure for the significance of the risk premia for the primary specification is conducted for Table 2 and for the alternative specifications in Table 3. The risk premia remain significant for the primary specification in Table 2 (p = 0.04 for the CAPM+TSF and p = 0.02 for the CAPM+FF). Results for the alternative TSF specifications in Table 3 are similar as those implied by the regular t-statistics except for Alt1 for which the results are no longer significant at the 5 percent level, with p = 0.06.

# 6.3. Tracking portfolio regressions with alternative horizons

Since it is not clear a priori how far ahead financial markets can forecast temperatures, we run a number of tracking portfolio regressions in which we use the: contemporaneous temperature, one-quarter-ahead, two-quarter-ahead, three-quarter-ahead, and four-quarter-ahead.

average temperature as the dependent variable. To remove the seasonality in monthly temperatures, we follow Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) and use temperature anomalies, defined relative to the 1951-1980 monthly averages. The results for both the six size-value and the 10 industry-size-value portfolios as basis assets are presented in Panels A and B of Table 7, respectively. First, the contemporaneous temperature does not significantly affect basis asset returns, as the chi-square test cannot reject at the 5% level the hypothesis that the coefficients on the basis asset returns are jointly zero. Second, the financial markets can forecast future temperatures, and the adjusted R² increases with the forecasting horizon. The adjusted R² rises from 17% for the one-quarter horizon to 38% (six basis assets case) or 40% (10 basis assets case) for the one-year horizon. This result echoes Roll (1984) who shows that financial markets may be more reliable indicators of future events influencing cash flows than the pronouncements of specialized forecasters: orange juice futures prices have forecasting power for weather conditions (involving frost) beyond the forecasts of the National Weather Service. The evidence thus justifies our tracking portfolio specification.

# 6.4. Global temperatures

Should global temperatures affect U.S. asset returns? Provisionally, the answer is No, invoking the recent climate-economy literature which emphasizes “local” effects of temperature. (For instance, Graff Zivin and Neidell 2014, find that temperatures affect labor supply within a county. That is, a high temperature in a county reduces the labor supply in that county, because “high temperatures cause discomfort, fatigue, and even cognitive impairment”, p. 1). Global temperatures, accordingly, may not impact U.S. asset returns. To test this conjecture, we obtain the global temperature anomalies data from the National Climatic Data Center. The “anomalies” are defined as the temperature minus the average temperature over the 1951-1980 period.

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

seasonally adjusted. Figure 3 plots the global and U.S. temperature anomalies. The general trends are similar, but there is considerable difference between U.S. and global temperatures. For instance, the lead article in The Economist of November 28-December 4 2015 notes that the global temperature was the highest in 2014 since NASA temperature recording began in 1880, but the U.S. temperature was not particularly high in that year.

If the global temperature affects U.S. financial markets, U.S. asset returns should reflect innovations in expectations about future global temperature variation. That is, our (U.S.-based) basis assets should have significant ability to track future global temperature fluctuations. We report the corresponding tracking portfolio regressions in Panel A of Table 8. For robustness, we explore both sets of basis assets. From the chi-square test we cannot reject the hypothesis that the coefficients are jointly zero at the 5% level, regardless of which set of basis assets we use, indicating that the (U.S.-specific) basis assets do not track global temperatures.

# 6.5. SMB, HML, and the temperature shock factor

As small-big and value-growth stocks are differently affected by temperature shocks, it is possible that SMB and HML capture some of the information in the temperature shock factor. We explore this perspective by separately regressing SMB and HML on the temperature shock factor. The results are reported in Panel B of Table 8 for both sets of basis assets. As expected, SMB and HML capture some information in the temperature shock factor, since there are significant correlations between the temperature shock factor and SMB/HML. Thus, a part of the well-known explanatory power of the size factor (SMB) and the value factor (HML) for cross-sections of returns may arise from differing sensitivities of assets to the temperature factor.

# 6.6. Temperature variability and exposure to temperature shocks

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

If temperature shocks really matter in terms of their local effects (on, for instance, labor supply and productivity), we should expect that firms in areas with more temperature variation are more negatively affected by temperature shocks. To capture local temperature variation, we retrieve state-level temperature data from the National Climatic Data Center, and rank the U.S. states according to the standard deviation of the state-level temperature from 1953 to 2015. We define the 10 states with the highest standard deviation of temperatures as high-temperature-variation states (H), and the 10 states with the lowest standard deviation of temperatures as low-temperature-variation states (L). Since firms often have their production facilities close by their headquarters (Coval and Moskowitz, 1999), we identify the location of a firm by its headquarter location, and form size-value as well as industry portfolios within states. We then run time-series regressions to examine if firms in high-temperature-variation states are more negatively affected by the temperature shock factor relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in low-temperature-variation states.

The results are reported in Table 9. The “Industry portfolios” section presents the results for the five industry portfolios. In three of five industries, the loadings on the temperature shock factor are significantly more negative for firms in the high-temperature-variation states. For instance, for manufacturing firms, while the loading on the temperature shock factor is -5.14 (t = -2.68) for firms in the high-temperature-variation states, it is -0.00 (t = -0.00) for firms in the low-temperature-variation states. The results for Other are inconsistent with our expectation, which may be partially due to our identification strategy. For instance, Other includes Trans.

Although coastal areas are typically vulnerable to climate change (Melillo, Richmond, and Yohe, 2014), many effects are not directly related to local temperatures. For instance, rising sea levels may be more due to global temperatures instead of local temperatures. The 10 high temperature-variation states in our sample are: Alaska, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin; The 10 low temperature-variation states are: Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

(transportation). Although a transportation company’s headquarter may be located in a low-temperature-variation state, it may provide its services in high-temperature variation states too, making our results difficult to interpret. The results for the size-value portfolios are shown in the “Size-value portfolios” section, and suggest that temperature shocks in general have more negative impact on firms in high-temperature-variation states.

# 6.7. Uncertainty about regulation

One potential explanation for the sensitivity of particular industries to the temperature shock factor is that the indicator has little intrinsic economic importance for temperature fluctuations but that markets fear the political pressures arising from common perceptions of a climate change threat that may lead to untoward regulation hurting business profits. This “untoward regulation” line of reasoning implies that those industries which are most vulnerable to regulation designed to reduce man-made climate change would be the most sensitive to the temperature change factor. A prospective regulatory impact generally entails rationing or taxation of carbon-dioxide emissions. Hence the prediction is that industries that are the most sensitive to the temperature change factor are those industries that have the highest share of carbon dioxide emissions.

Schipper (2006) provides data on carbon-dioxide emissions in U.S. manufacturing. Manufacturing accounts for around 84 percent of energy-related carbon-dioxide emissions. The Petroleum, Chemicals, and Primary Metals industries have the highest carbon-dioxide emissions, together generating more than half of these emissions. However, it is apparent from Table 4 that Oil (Petroleum and Natural Gas), Chems (Chemicals), and Mines (Precious Metals, Non-Metallic, and Industrial Metal Mining) do not have particularly large negative sensitivities to the temperature shock factor. Furthermore, many of the industries in Table 4 with strong negative

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Exposures to the temperature shock factor are non-manufacturing industries such as Finance, Retail, and Meals, with obviously low carbon-dioxide emissions. These observations do not support the “untoward regulation” explanation.

We also carry out a more formal test. If concerns about regulation drive temperature sensitivity, firms headquartered in states run by Democrats should be more exposed to temperature shocks than firms headquartered in states run by Republicans, given the different climate policies advocated by the two parties. We thus form size-value as well as industry portfolios within Republican and Democrat states, and run time-series regressions to examine if firms in Republican states are less negatively affected by the temperature shock factor, relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in Democrat states.

The results are in Table 10. The “Industry portfolios” section shows that in all five industries, the loadings on the temperature shock factor are not significantly less negative for firms in the Republican states. E.g., for manufacturing firms the loading on the factor is -3.66 (t = -1.75) for firms in Republican states but -2.95 (t = -2.43) for firms in Democrat states. The results for the size-value portfolios are in the “Size-value portfolios” section and suggest that temperature shocks in general do not have less negative impact on stock returns of firms in Republican states.

# 7. Summary and Implications

How do US equity markets react to news contained in US temperature changes? Tracking portfolios formed from basis assets distinguished by value, size, and/or industry have significant value in filtering the economic importance of persistent temperature changes inferred from temperature shocks. We hypothesize that (i) a significant risk premium exists on a temperature tracking portfolio, (ii) its impact on the cost of equity capital, at least until recently, has been.

26

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

increasing over time, and (iii) loadings at the industry level on this tracking portfolio are generally negative and more so for industries considered to be more sensitive to climate change.

On the whole we are able to confirm the hypotheses and infer, taking the average risk premium, that the cross-sectional average cost of equity capital is 0.22 percentage points higher on an annual basis as a result of uncertainty related to future temperatures.

The severity of impact and even the existence of climate change are heavily debated, and it is difficult to obtain an objective perspective. For this purpose, financial markets may be helpful in uncovering true perceptions as they aggregate the beliefs of market participants who do not merely offer opinions but have “skin in the game.” So, what does the result we find from the U.S. equity market data, that the uncertainty about temperature changes contributes an annual average of 0.22 percentage points to costs of capital, say about costs of climate change?

A convenient means of capitalizing the one-period impact to account for the long run present value costs of temperature shocks is to use the Gordon growth model approximation arising when we equate asset prices with the expected net present value of future dividends, and proxy the associated variables by setting the dynamic paths of dividends, dividend growth, and costs of capital equal to their averages. Aggregate stock market values can then be expressed as P=D/(R−G), in which P is the current stock market price index, D the end-of-period expected dividends (considered a constant proportion of GDP), G the average anticipated growth rate of dividends, and R the average cost of equity capital. We are then able to draw the following conclusions by placing our results in the context of the existing literature:

1. Henry (2003) finds an approximate one-to-one relationship between the cost of capital and GDP growth. This is consistent with the Gordon growth perspective in which the impact of a change in the cost of capital is equivalent to the impact of an opposite change in the

27

# ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

growth rate of dividends or output: %∆P/∆R=−%∆P/∆G. Accordingly, the stock market wealth impact of the 0.22 percent increase in the cost of equity capital (based on the full-sample primary specification) is equivalent to that of a 0.22 percent reduction in the growth rate of dividends or GDP. Our explanation for the reduction in the GDP growth rate answers Dell, Jones and Olken’s (2014) call for mechanisms explaining the empirical temperature-growth linkage. It also provides a perspective, showing that the impact of temperature fluctuations on the cost of equity capital alone is of higher magnitude than the total policy cost of mitigation, an annualized reduction of consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage (IPCC, 2014), which allows room to contemplate more aggressive climate-change mitigation policies.

(2) The Gordon growth approximation also implies that %∆P=−(P/D∆R. If we set) P/D (the price-dividend ratio) equal to 36, which is its average value over our sample period from March 1953 to December 2014 (see Robert Shiller’s website) then the present value of the cost of temperature shocks is 36 x 0.22% = 7.92%. To put our estimate of a 7.92 percent loss due to climate change in the perspective of previous estimates, consider that: the literature has considered mainly the specific present value costs of permanent losses in GDP due to abrupt climate change in future years, and, more recently, the costs of losses in GDP related to extreme weather resulting from climate changes. The estimated cost of climate change based on these mechanisms varies from around 0.2% to 1.0% (Stern, 2007) to 2.0% to 3.5% per 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature (Choinière and Horowitz, 2006) and a maximum of 3.75% (Heal and Kriström, 2002). However, the uncertainty about temperature fluctuations adds substantially to the overall costs and shows up in the higher cost of equity capital which previous studies have ignored in this context. Our result amounts to adding an additional present value cost of climate change of larger magnitude to previously identified costs.

Figure 2. Rolling Impact Estimates of the Temperature Shock Factor.
The impact is estimated for the entire sample using 30 years of preceding data for each estimate. Accordingly, the first period starts in 1983:4. We update the estimates each month by dropping the earliest observation and adding the latest observation. The mimicking factor (TSF) portfolio weights and the loadings on the mimicking factors are estimated using the 30 years of data preceding the data point. The value-weighted loadings are then multiplied by the TSF realization for the data point to obtain the impact estimate for that month.

In Panels A-D, PRIMARY represents our main specification given the basis asset and conditioning variable choices of Vassalou (2003) based on equation (4); ALT1 represents an alternative specification given the basis asset and conditioning variable choices of Kapadia (2011) based on equation (4a); ALT2 represents our alternative specification with the temperature growth rate as the temperature shock factor (equation (4b)); ALT3 directly uses the temperature surprise as the temperature shock factor (equation (4c)). Panel E shows the 30-year rolling average standard deviation of annual U.S. temperatures.

The tracking portfolio regression results are in Panel A. All results are for the 1953:5 - 2014:5 period using overlapping data. While the dependent variable for PRIMARY and ALT1 is Tt+12 (the average annual temperature from t+1 to t+12), that for ALT2 is TGRTHt+12 (the temperature growth rate). SL, SM, SH, BL, BM, t, BH, LCMLG, and LGMRF are excess returns: the Fama-French size-value portfolios net of the one-month T-Bill rate, the corporate bond rate minus the long-term government bond rate, and the long-term government bond rate minus the T-Bill rate; RFt-1, DEFt-1-, and TERMt-1 represent, respectively, the lagged one-month T-Bill rate, the lagged default risk premium, and the lagged term premium. Panel B presents for each specification the average return on the zero-investment portfolio with the weights given by the coefficient estimates in Panel A. To adjust for the autocorrelation in errors resulting from the overlapping temperature shock data, Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation corrected standard errors are obtained employing a bandwidth of 24 months.

# Table 2. Summary statistics of time-series and cross-sectional regressions for 55 size-value and industry portfolios under the primary specification

Panel A summarizes time-series regressions to explain monthly excess returns on 55 size-value and industry portfolios. Panel A provides the average absolute value of the intercepts (|Alpha|), the average adjusted R² (AVG R²), and the GRS F-test statistic (GRS). Panel B reports the Fama and MacBeth (1973) two-pass OLS regressions with 55 size-value and industry portfolios as the test assets. γ is the estimated risk premium associated with each factor. tEIV and tMIS are the Shanken (1992) errors-in-variables robust t-ratio and the Shanken and Zhou (2007) misspecification robust t-ratio, respectively. We also report the OLS cross-sectional adjusted R². The models are:

- CAPM: \( r_{it} = \alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + \epsilon_{it} \)
- FF: \( r_{it} = \alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + sSMB_{ti} + hHML_{ti} + \epsilon_{it} \)
- CAPM+TSF: \( r_{it} = \alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + fTSF_{ti} + \epsilon_{it} \)
- FF+TSF: \( r_{it} = \alpha_i + mMKT_{ti} + sSMB_{ti} + hHML_{ti} + fTSF_{ti} + \epsilon_{it} \)

where \( r_{it} \) is the excess return on asset i in period t, and MKT is the excess market return, SMB is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of small stocks and big stocks, HML is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of high book-to-market (value) stocks and low book-to-market (growth) stocks, and TSF is the tracking portfolio returns of changes in expectations about temperature changes from equation (4).

# Table 4. Factor loadings of 55 size-value and Industry Portfolios

The factor loadings of the portfolios are inferred from:

rit = αi + mMKTt + fiTSFt + it

where rit is the excess return on asset i in period t, MKT, TSF are the excess returns on the market and the temperature shock factor. The β’s are the associated factor loadings, and it is the disturbance. To save space, we do not report the associated HAC-robust (Newey-West with 12 lags) t-statistics for 55 size-value and industry portfolios. The significant factor loadings at the 5% level of significance are in bold.

To formally test Hypothesis 2 with the industry portfolios, we create two equal-weighted portfolios. “High” includes the high-exposure industries identified by Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) (specifically: agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; construction; mining; and transportation and utilities; and manufacturing), while “Low” consists of the remaining industries. The loadings on the temperature shock factor for “High” and “Low” capture the average sensitivities of the high-exposure and low-exposure industries, respectively. Consequently, the loading on the temperature shock factor for “High – Low” picks up the sensitivity difference between the high- and low-exposure industries. For the temperature factor we use the primary temperature factor TSF obtained from equation (4).

To test Hypothesis 2 formally for the size-value portfolios, in Panel B we also form equal-weighted portfolios to and use the primary temperature factor TSF obtained from equation (4). “Small” consists of the five small-capitalization portfolios, and “Big” includes the five large-capitalization portfolios; “Value” contains the five value portfolios, and “Growth” comprises the five growth portfolios. “Small – Big” picks up the difference between small and big stocks, and “Value – Growth” does the same for value and growth stocks.

# Table 5. Value-weighted Annual Impact (%) Estimates

The economy-wide average impact on the cost of equity capital is obtained by multiplying the temperature shock factor risk premium (from Table 3) by the weighted average loading on this factor. We use the market value weights and loadings of the 55 industry and size-value sorted portfolios. The weight is obtained by dividing the market value of each portfolio by the sum of the market values of the 55 portfolios. The loadings on the alternative versions of TSF are obtained as in Table 4. Panel A shows the value-weighted impact for the entire sample period.

Following Cooper, Gutierrez and Hameed (2004), we estimate in Panel B the impact of the temperature shock factor in two sub-sample periods with the following regression:

IMPACT = i83−98D83−98 + i99−14D99−14 + et

where IMPACT is the impact in month t estimated based on 30-year rolling samples. Since our first observation is in t 1953:4, the first estimate is for 1983:4. It uses the construction of the TSF and loadings on this factor for the period 1953:4-1983:3 and multiplies the value-weighted loadings by the TSF realization for 1983:4 to obtain IMPACT1983:4. We then roll everything forward by a month to find IMPACT1983:5, etc. D83-98 is equal to 1 for all months in the period 1983-1998 and zero otherwise, and D99-14 is equal to 1 for 1999-2014 and zero otherwise. The mean impact in 1983-1998 is i83-98, while that in 1999-2014 is i99-14. To test whether the mean impacts are equal, we run the following regression:

IMPACT = a + iDifferencet D99−14 + et

The impact difference is iDifference. The t-ratios are based on Newey-West HAC standard errors with the lag parameter set equal to 12. The subsample results are presented in Panel B.

# Table 6. Time-series and cross-sectional tests with the tracking portfolio based on 10 industry portfolios

We use 10 industry-size-value portfolios (SL and SH for each portfolio in the Fama-French five-industry classification) as the basis assets to construct the temperature shock tracking portfolio TSF10. Panel A provides the tracking portfolio coefficients on each portfolio, Newey-West standard errors are based on 24 lags. Panels B and C present the time-series and cross-sectional tests with TSF10 replacing TSF. Significance is evaluated by t-values based on the Shanken correction (EIV), the Shanken-Zhou correction (MIS), and a bootstrapping procedure p-value.

# Table 7. Robustness checks with the tracking portfolio

We run a number of tracking portfolio regressions, in which we use the contemporaneous temperature, one-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+3), two-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+6), three-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+9), and four-quarter ahead average temperature (i.e., from t+1 to t+12) as the dependent variable. To remove the seasonality in monthly temperatures, we follow Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2015) and use temperature anomalies, defined relative to the 1951-1980 average. The basis assets are six size-value portfolios in Panel A, and 10 industry-size and BM portfolios in Panel B. T-statistics use Newey-West standard errors with lag (bandwidth) determined as max[3, 2*horizon] following Bekaert and Hoerova (2014), where the horizon equals the number of months in the forecast interval.

# Table 8. Global temperatures, SMB, and HML

We report the tracking portfolio regressions for the global temperature in Panel A. The dependent variable in all cases is Tt+12, the average annual global temperature from t+1 to t+12. SL, SM, SH, BL, BM, and BH are excess returns: the Fama-French size-value portfolios net of the one-month T-Bill rate. RFt-1, DEFt-1, and TERMt-1 represent, respectively, the lagged one-month T-Bill rate, the lagged default risk premium, and the lagged term premium. t is the deterministic time trend. Cnsmr: Consumer Durables, NonDurables, Wholesale, Retail, and Some Services (Laundries, Repair Shops); Manuf: Manufacturing, Energy, and Utilities; HiTec: Business Equipment, Telephone and Television Transmission; Hlth: Healthcare, Medical Equipment, and Drugs; Other: Mines, Constr, BldMt, Trans, Hotels, Bus Serv, Entertainment, Finance. To adjust for the autororrelation in errors resulting from the overlapping temperature shock data, Newey-West standard errors are obtained to calculate the t-ratios employing a bandwidth of 24 months.

We separately regress SMB and HML on the temperature shock factor, and report the results in Panel B.

# Table 9. Climate sensitivity in high and low temperature-variation states

We retrieve state-level temperature data from the National Climatic Data Center, and rank the U.S. states according to the standard deviation of the state-level temperature from 1953 to 2015. We define the 10 states with the highest standard deviation of temperatures as high temperature-variation states (H), and the 10 states with the lowest standard deviation of temperatures as low temperature-variation states (L). We run time-series regressions to examine if firms in high temperature-variation states are more negatively affected by the temperature shock factor, relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in low temperature-variation states. Section “Industry portfolios” present the results for five industry portfolios, those for the size-value portfolios are shown in Section “Size-value portfolios”. Standard t-statistics are presented in parentheses.

# Table 10. Climate sensitivity in Republican and Democrat states

If concerns about regulation drive temperature sensitivity, firms headquartered in states run by Democrats should be more exposed to temperature shocks than firms headquartered in states run by Republicans, given the different climate policies advocated by two parties. We form size-value as well as industry portfolios within Republican and Democrat states, and run time-series regressions to examine if firms in Republican states are less negatively affected by the temperature shock factor, relative to similar firms (in terms of size-value or industry) in Democrat states. Section “Industry portfolios” present the results for five industry portfolios, those for the size-value portfolios are shown in the section “Size-value portfolios”. Standard t-statistics are presented in parentheses.

# ABSTRACT

For many decades, there has been a debate about the relation between corporate social/environmental performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP). Our study presents a review of academic research on this topic by applying a second-order meta-analysis. The data sample combines 25 previous meta-analyses yielding a sample size of one million observations. Our results demonstrate a highly significant, positive, robust, and bilateral CSP-CFP relation. The relation is positive regardless of whether firms focus on ecological or social aspects, though corporate reputation turns out to be a key CSP determinant. We find a particularly strong CSP-CFP relation for operational CFP. Furthermore, we add a new perspective on potential biases resulting from the studies’ publishing source: social issues-oriented journals and methodological weaker papers do not distort the positive CSP-CFP relation.

# Introduction

WHAT IS THE RELATION BETWEEN CORPORATE SOCIAL/ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE (CSP) AND CORPORATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (CFP)? For nearly 50 years, scholars have investigated this question. The search for the answer has become particularly prominent since the end of the 1990s. Our study sample comprises 1214 empirical primary studies on the CSP-CFP relation. While considerable research has been conducted, it is as yet less clear how different CSP dimensions and CFP categories interrelate and in which way various moderating factors determine the CSP-CFP relation (Aguinis and Glavas, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Peloza, 2009). Moreover, the robustness of the business case over time has only occasionally been analyzed (Borgers, Derwall, Koedijk, & ter Horst, 2013; Derwall, Koedijk, & Ter Horst, 2011). The aim of this study is to provide a more detailed understanding of the CSP-CFP relation.

# T. Busch and G. Friede

In 2003, the widely cited Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes (2003) meta-study responded to calls for a moratorium on CSP-CFP research (Margolis & Walsh, 2001; Rowley & Berman, 2000). Orlitzky et al. (2003) found a significant, positive, and bidirectional correlation of CSP with CFP. Despite these findings, the authors claim that this relation cannot be generalized across all CSP dimensions and CFP categories, detecting a large variability – even after correcting for sampling error and measurement error. Since then, the picture has become even more ambiguous and critical debates have resurfaced about the actual CSP-CFP relation (Aldag, 2013; Barnett, 2007; Borgers et al., 2013; Devinney, 2009; Fleming & Jones, 2013; Orlitzky, 2011, 2013; Wood, 2010). On the one hand, many scholars claim that, to date, the literature on the CSP-CFP relation remains inconclusive. On the other hand, a whole range of new studies and further meta-analyses have been published supporting a positive relation. Thus, more than a decade after Orlitzky et al. (2003), it seems to be the right time to revive the paper’s spirit and ask: when generalizing existing research, is there still evidence that it pays off to be a good firm?

To answer this question, we apply a second-order meta-analysis. In other scientific disciplines like medicine, psychology, or education (i.e. research areas typically also experiencing vast amounts of data and conflicting results), meta-analytic techniques are widespread and have been applied since the 1960s (Glass, 1976; Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Hunter, Schmidt, & Jackson, 1982). With the growing number of meta-analyses, the idea of cumulative meta-analysis also appeared (Kazrin, Durac, & Agteros, 1979). Several labels have been used for such analyses: overview of reviews, review of reviews, umbrella reviews, meta-reviews, cumulative meta-analyses, meta-meta-analysis, and second-order meta-analysis (Cooper & Koenka, 2012). However, until recently, no standard procedure with comparable rigor to first-order meta-analytical approaches had emerged. This paper makes use of the novel method for conducting second-order meta-analysis proposed by Schmidt and Oh (2013).

We contribute to the academic inquiry on the CSP-CFP relation in several regards. By summarizing the findings of existing meta-analyses and utilizing a data sample that is more than 25 times larger compared to the average of previous studies, we are able to generate fairly robust results. Not only do we demonstrate that the main findings of Orlitzky and colleagues still hold today, but our results deliver more unequivocal and comprehensive conclusions. The highly significant, positive, and bilateral CSP-CFP relation varies in magnitude depending on different CSP dimensions and CFP categories, but effect sizes are less variable than expected. Surprisingly, the relation is positive regardless of whether firms focus on ecological or social aspects, though corporate reputation turns out to be a key aspect. We highlight that a particularly strong CSP-CFP relation exists when operational CFP is considered. Furthermore, we conclude that shrinking CSP-CFP correlations in meta-analyses over time can be ascribed to more sophisticated research methods and are not observable at primary study level. Finally, we address potential biases resulting from the studies’ publishing source: we show that social issues-oriented and lower-impact journals as well as methodological weaker papers do not distort the CSP-CFP relation. The practical relevance of our second-order meta-analysis is: the business case for being a good firm is undeniable.

# Hypotheses

Theoretical arguments support a positive, negative, as well as neutral CSP-CFP relation. Arguments supporting a positive CSP-CFP relation are typically rooted in stakeholder theory (Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Freeman, 1984), the resource-based view (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984), institutional theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983), or draw on the industrial organization literature (Porter, 1979). When arguing for a negative CSP-CFP relation, scholars usually refer to Levitt’s (1958) or Friedman’s (1962, 1970) logic of social responsibility of the firm to solely increase its profits. Moreover, arguments based on portfolio theory (Markowitz, 1952, 1959) point towards disadvantageous limitations for portfolio construction when picking stocks following a CSP filter. Finally, proponents of the efficient market hypothesis (Fama, 1970, 1991) argue for a neutral – or at least non-exploitable – relation of CSP and CFP, as all information is priced at any time by the market. This also includes potentially business-relevant CSP information.

Next to these differing theoretical perspectives, the empirical CSP-CFP debate to date faces several questions. Even though considerable primary research has been conducted, it still remains less clear how different CSP dimensions and CFP categories interrelate and whether the business case holds as well for different measures of CFP. Eventually, questions of robustness and moderating effects arise which need to be answered in order to derive.

# Corporate social and financial performance

unequivocal conclusions regarding the CSP-CFP relation and its manifestations. This paper seeks to answer some of these questions.

# The general CSP-CFP Relation

# Direction of the CSP-CFP

In the academic literature, to date, the business case for CSP seems to be increasingly accepted and empirically supported (Carroll & Shabana, 2010; Eccles, Ioannou, & Serafeim, 2014; Flammer, 2015). In line with the outcomes of previous research that summarized large numbers of primary research (e.g. Endrikat, Guenther, & Hoppe, 2014; Margolis, Elfenbein, & Walsh, 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003) we, thus, propose:

H1a: CSP and CFP are generally positively related across a wide variety of study designs.

# Causality of the CSP-CFP Relation

Next to the general CSP-CFP relation, the subsequent question pertains to the causality of this relation. Proponents of good management theory (Waddock & Graves, 1997) argue that prior good CSP leads subsequently to better CFP. The opposite explanation is the slack resources theory (Cyert & March, 1963; J. B. McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988), where excess financial resources of a company are seen as a necessary condition in order to reinvest and, thus, counter threats or exploit opportunities (Daniel, Lohrke, Fornaciari, & Turner, 2004). Following this view, prior superior CFP leads subsequently to improved CSP. As both theories found theoretical and empirical support, a common argument is that there exists a virtuous circle between CSP and CFP – they seem to be related reciprocally and concurrently (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Hart & Ahuja, 1996; Waddock & Graves, 1997). We follow this line of thought and thus expect:

H1b: The causality of the CSP-CFP relation is bidirectional.

# The Relation of various CSP Dimensions and CFP

# Corporate Environmental Performance

Since the first review studies on the CSP-CFP relation (Aldag & Bartol, 1978; Arlow & Gannon, 1982), research has considered corporate environmental performance (CEP) as part of CSP. Orlitzky and Benjamin (2001) were the first to split the CSP construct and analyze CEP separately. These authors assume investors and consumers are less aware of the environmental performance of firms. In contrast, social aspects are more likely to be publicly communicated and, thus, reflected by stock- and stakeholders. Accordingly, the authors report a weaker CEP-CFP correlation compared to the overall sample. Orlitzky et al. (2003) reiterate the weak relation between CEP and CFP. Over the course of the years, individual meta-studies dedicated specifically to CEP and/or the social dimension of CSP were published. The summary effects for the CEP-CFP relation were often positive and significant (Albertini, 2013; Dixon-Fowler, Slater, Johnson, Ellstrand, & Romi, 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014). However, the absolute level usually demonstrated lower correlation levels compared to studies purely focusing on social aspects (Combs, Liu, Hall, & Ketchen, 2006; Crook, Todd, Combs, Woehr, & Ketchen, 2011; Unger, Rauch, Frese, & Rosenbusch, 2011). In line with these findings, we expect:

H2a: The relation between CSP (excluding environmental aspects) and CFP is stronger than for CEP and CFP.

# CSP Reputation

Four CSP dimensions attracted the greatest interest among meta-researchers in the past: CSP reputation, CSP disclosure, CSP philanthropy, and CSP audits, processes, and policies. CSP reputation (Barnett, Jermier, & Lafferty, 2006) typically yields high correlations with CFP. The reason being that corporate reputation is of particular importance.

relevance or interest to a variety of external parties. For example, reputation is likely to influence customers’ behaviours and investors’ decisions (Orlitzky et al., 2003). This intangible character of corporate reputation, which is difficult to replicate, leads to sustained superior profit over time (P. W. Roberts & Dowling, 2002). Literature reviews and meta-analytical results point in a similar direction (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Sabate & Puente, 2003). We, thus, hypothesize that CSP reputation plays a dominant role:

# H2b:

Within the CSP dimensions, reputational aspects have the strongest relation to CFP.

# CSP Disclosure

A more controversial debate exists regarding the link between CSP disclosure and CFP. Wiseman (1982) finds considerable discrepancies between CSP disclosures and actual CSP. Ullmann (1985) concludes that voluntary disclosure should not be considered as a proxy for CSP performance. R. W. Roberts (1992) discovers that stakeholder power, philanthropic activities, and previous economic performance significantly explain concurrent CSP disclosure. Orlitzky et al. (2003) ascribe a minimal positive relation between CSP disclosure practices and CFP, whereas additionally almost all of the observed effect size variance is due to statistical artifacts. Research in environmental management also nourishes a weak relation among both measures. Schultze and Trommer (2012, p. 396) summarize, based on a review of empirical research, that ‘as disclosure is mostly voluntary, many companies only provide beneficial rather than accurate, unbiased information on their current performance’. This could lead, in turn, to distorted information of market participants accompanied by increased stock volatility when investors realize that their investment decisions were based on wrong assumptions (Orlitzky, 2013). Thus, we expect a relatively weaker link of CSP disclosure and CFP:

# H2c:

Within the CSP dimensions, CSP disclosure has the weakest relation to CFP.

# The Relation of CSP and various CFP Categories

# Perceptional CFP

Perceptual evaluations of business performance by senior executives are considered to be valid substitutes for objective CFP measures. The product–moment correlation coefficient between subjective and objective measures ranges in empirical studies between 0.4 and 0.8 (Guthrie, 2001; Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1987; Wall et al., 2004). Despite managers’ discretionary assessment of the firm performance, the judgment is often a fair reflection of financial reality and not per se overrated (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1987). Depending on the research context, the application of survey-based measures can even be the preferred choice of researchers. A quarter of empirical studies in top management journals therefore use some kind of subjective organizational performance measure (P. J. Richard, Devinney, Yip, & Johnson, 2009). Perceptual CFP measures are compiled by one-fifth of the meta-studies in our sample. We formulate our hypothesis in accordance with meta-analyses that report high correlations between CSP and perceptual CFP measures (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wu, 2006):

# H3a:

CSP has the strongest relation to perceptional CFP than to other CFP categories.

# Operational CFP

Operational performance such as productivity allows a nuanced conceptualization of business performance as it focuses on those operational success factors that might lead to superior CFP (Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986). As an intermediate-outcome metric (Peloza, 2009), it reflects information that is closer to the value creation process within a firm and more remote to the variety of interacting and overlapping factors like discretionary accounting practices or general stock market movements (P. J. Richard et al., 2009). McWilliams, Siegel, and Teoh (1999) caution not to use share prices as a sole metric for CFP when investigating the CSP-CFP relation. Effects of specific plant or product-level information on value creation cannot be fully captured by simply looking at market-based.

measures such as shareholder value. Therefore, the effects of CSP on operational CFP measures should be less likely to be drowned out by capital market ‘noise’ (Peloza, 2009, p. 1527). Empirical evidence for this argument was found in a meta-analysis on human resource factors (Combs et al., 2006): operational CFP measures such as staff turnover yield higher correlations than other accounting- or market-based performance categories. Similar results were carried out in the environmental supply chain context: operational CFP measures such as reduced material and waste streams demonstrated slightly higher correlations to market-based measures (Golicic & Smith, 2013). Thus, we hypothesize:

# H3b: CSP has a stronger relation to operational CFP than to market-based CFP.

# Traditional CFP Categories

When considering the range of the traditional CFP measures, Cochran and Wood (1984) propose that accounting-based CFP such as return on assets may be the best proxy for measuring CFP – presuming that the accounting practices of firms are comparable. They more adequately reflect internal decision-making capabilities and managerial performance rather than external evaluations of investors. Empirical evidence supports this: accounting-based CFP measures have a stronger relation to CSP than market-based CFP measures (Margolis et al., 2009; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wu, 2006).

Growth-based CFP – typically determined by sales, profit, or employee growth – is not directly affected by capital market developments. However, companies’ growth can be distorted by inorganic growth from acquisitions or divestments. Such activities usually have a relatively higher impact on growth measures (O’Shaughnessy & Flanagan, 1998) compared to changes in accounting figures (King, Dalton, Daily, & Covin, 2004). Accordingly, empirical research finds a weaker CFP relation for growth as a CFP measure compared to accounting-based CFP (Dixon-Fowler et al., 2013; Unger et al., 2011).

With regards to risk, primary research (Bansal & Clelland, 2004; Godfrey, Merrill, & Hansen, 2009; J. B. McGuire et al., 1988) suggests that CSP reduces companies’ risk. Most of the empirical studies measure risk either as accounting-based risk (i.e. debt to assets) or market-based risk (i.e. beta-factor, total volatility). However, the observed correlations in meta-analyses are relatively low (e.g. Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). Summing up, these arguments bring us to the following hypothesis:

# H3c: Accounting-based CFP demonstrates a stronger relation to CSP than growth-, risk-, and market-based CFP.

# Mutual Funds

Several studies on mutual funds, financial indices, and virtual portfolios suggest that the positive CSP-CFP relation is weaker compared to studies using firm-specific CFP measures. To date, this result presents a puzzling outcome in CSP-CFP research. The first mutual funds studies appeared in the early 1990s. The initial findings of these early studies discovered that the performance of CSP-oriented mutual funds is not statistically different from the performance of conventional mutual funds (e.g. Hamilton, Jo, & Statman, 1993). However, ever since then, further investigations have been carried out in several primary and review studies (Bauer, Koedijk, & Otten, 2005; Capelle-Blancard & Monjon, 2014; Rathner, 2013; Revelli & Viviani, 2015), hardening the conclusion that the CSP-CFP link is weaker for mutual funds as compared to other CSP-CFP studies. In turn, we hypothesize:

# H3d: Studies on mutual funds demonstrate a weaker CSP-CFP relation compared to studies using other CFP measures.

# Moderating Factors

The literature discusses a range of conditions under which CSP and CFP influence each other (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). In addition to the most common factors – company size and the type of industry.

(Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Buehler & Shetty, 1974; Griffin & Mahon, 1997; Orlitzky, 2008) – several other moderating factors have been used in primary studies. These are visibility to the public and consumers (Fry, Keim, & Meiners, 1982; Jiang & Bansal, 2003), research and development investments (McWilliams & Siegel, 2000), economic conditions (Golicic & Smith, 2013), the level of diversification, advertising, government sales, consumer income, and stage in the industry as well as the firm life cycle (Aguinis & Glavas, 2012; Elsayed & Paton, 2009; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Since not all primary studies use the same bundle of control variables and/or moderating factors, it is difficult to compare such effects in meta-analyses. Thus, as meta-analysts have not adjusted for these factors in a comparable manner, we also cannot investigate these effects. Nonetheless, a few central moderating factors can be assessed at second-order level.

# Effects over Time

It is not unusual that academic studies investigating a specific effect for the first time demonstrate impressive effect sizes which partly diminish in subsequent research studies (Trikalinos & Ioannidis, 2005). Griffin and Mahon (1997) have already called for research that looks at the CSP-CFP relation over time. To date, it is still an open question as to whether this is a time-independent relation. Scholars suggest that institutional investors increasingly focus on stakeholder issues (Borgers et al., 2013; Derwall et al., 2011). On account of learning effects and changes in investor values, these issues came into focus in recent years and subsequently the CSP-CFP relation – in this case measured as market-based CFP – diminished considerably since the mid-2000s. However, in meta-research on the CSP-CFP link, the evidence of a time dependency is not consistent. In their meta-analysis, Pavie and Filho (2008) show considerable effect size differences before and after 1998. Some discover no or only non-significant relations (Albertini, 2013; Endrikat et al., 2014; Rubera & Kirca, 2012). Based on suggestions from primary studies and meta-analyses, we hypothesize about the moderating role of time:

H4a: The CSP-CFP relation shrinks over time.

# Sample Size

Hedges (1981) demonstrates that effect sizes for small samples are biased upward. Evidence from cumulative meta-analyses in different fields supports this finding and cautions that meta-analyses with a small number of subjects may overestimate effects (Ioannidis, Trikalinos, Ntzani, & Contopoulos-Ioannidis, 2003; Trikalinos et al., 2004). By using the number of included studies as a weighting factor, the calculation design of meta-analyses seeks to adjust for this circumstance. If the CSP-CFP relation was a statistical outlier, we would observe effect size differences depending on the study sample size. Initial observations of our sample based on the number of included primary studies in a meta-analysis and the corresponding meta-study overall effect size support such a conclusion. We therefore hypothesize:

H4b: The CSP-CFP relation shrinks with the growing number of primary studies in the meta-sample.

# The Role of the Studies’ Publishing Source

Orlitzky (2011) examines in a review of the 2003 data whether the empirical evidence on the CSP-CFP relation differs depending on the kind of publishing journal. The author finds that the average correlations in economics, finance, and accounting journals are less than half of the correlations published in social issues-oriented journals (SIM journals – social issues in management). The deviation is statistically significant. Allouche and Laroche (2005) reflect on their meta-analysis results by differentiating the publishing sources – business ethics journals, accounting journals, and management journals. They find no significant differences. In order to investigate the role of the publishing source for our sample, we follow a three-step approach. First, we differentiate between SIM and general management (GM) journals, similarly to Orlitzky (2011). Second, we classify the journals of our 25 meta-analyses according to the Thomson Reuters’ Journal Citation Reports (JCR) classification standard [Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) subject categories]. Third, we take into consideration the JCR journal impact factor of the publishing journals for the meta-analyses in our sample. We expect that effect sizes will tend to be smaller in more rigorous journals (e.g. Aguinis, Beaty, Boik, & Pierce, 2005). We, thus, hypothesize:

DOI: 10.1002/csr

# Corporate social and financial performance

H4c: The CSP-CFP relation is distorted by the publication source; SIM and lower-impact journals report more positive outcomes.

# Methodological Quality

An analysis of meta-analyses in education research proposes that ‘there seems to be a particular tendency for smaller effect sizes to be associated with higher methodological quality’ (Tamim, Bernard, Borokhovski, Abrami, & Schmid, 2011, p. 14). However, the results were not significant. Based on nearly 200 meta-studies in management research, Aguinis, Dalton, Bosco, Pierce, and Dalton (2011) find that methodological choices have very little impact on the overall effect sizes. Lipsey and Wilson (1993) reveal for 302 studies in psychology that effect sizes in meta-studies are not inflated by the inclusion of methodological weak studies. To create generalizable conclusions for the CSP-CFP debate, we build on Aguinis et al. (2011) and apply a methodological strength assessment. We hypothesize:

H4d: The CSP-CFP relation is independent of methodological choices.

# Methods and Data

The first comprehensive summary of meta-analyses was published at the beginning of the 1990s, aggregating the work of 302 meta-analyses (Lipsey & Wilson, 1993). Ever since then, various examples of how to aggregate existing research summaries have emerged (Ahn, Ames, & Myers, 2012; Aytug, Rothstein, Zhou, & Kern, 2012; Cooper & Koenka, 2012; Hattie, 2009; Peterson, 2001; D. Richard, Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003; Tamim et al., 2011; Wilson & Lipsey, 2001). The main challenges of second-order meta-analyses are the precise calculation of the second-order average effect and estimation of its sampling error. Hunter and Schmidt (2004) and Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, and Rothstein (2009) already address these challenges, but only recently have sufficient statistical methods been provided.

This study uses Schmidt and Oh’s (2013) method for second-order meta-analysis. A second-order meta-analysis combines a number of independent but methodologically comparable first-order meta-analyses. It enables better generalization across contexts with a tremendously larger sample size and enhanced meta-analytic moderating factor analyses. Conclusions can be derived not just from a fraction of available primary studies, but presumably with a sample close to a complete set of studies. The Schmidt and Oh (2013) second-order meta-analysis is an advancement of the psychometric first-order predecessor – the Hunter-Schmidt (2004), approach, which is used by more than 80% of meta-analyses in management research (Aguinis et al., 2011).

Schmidt and Oh’s (2013) method has two important advantages compared to other second-level meta-analytic approaches. First, their method determines how much variance across a set of comparable first-order meta-analyses is due to second-order sampling error. This can considerably reduce the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta-analyses and allows estimation of the true (non-artifactual) variance across these mean effect sizes. Second, the analysis enables the computation of reliability estimates for the first-order meta-analyses and, thus, allows us to produce a more accurate estimation of the true mean effect size in each first-order meta-analysis.

Schmidt and Oh (2013) present three approaches for second-order meta-analysis: bare-bones second-order meta-analysis; psychometric second-order meta-analysis with artifact distribution of first-order meta-analysis estimates; and psychometric second-order meta-analysis with individual corrected first-order meta-analysis estimates. Because of the high number of first-order meta-analyses in our sample using artifact distribution correction without correcting primary studies individually, we opted for the first two approaches to calculate our results. Both approaches vary in terms of the input data (uncorrected or attenuated correlations vis-à-vis corrected or disattenuated correlations), the weighting scheme of the first-order meta-analyses, and the calculation of the second-order mean effect size.1

1See Table 1 in Schmidt and Oh (2013, p. 210) for a technical summary of the three approaches.

Like the first-order meta-analytical predecessor methodology (Hunter et al., 1982; Hunter & Schmidt, 2004), second-order meta-analysis is also a fully random effect model.

# The Search Process

We included a CSP-CFP meta-analysis in our sample insofar the applied CSP definition of meta-analysis matched the CSP understanding expressed by Wood (2010) and Clarkson (1995). Wood (2010, p. 64) argued for ‘CSP as an overarching, multi-dimensional construct’ where vast literature on organizational culture, managerial decision-making, or employee relations practices ‘waits to be brought into the field of CSP’. Also, Clarkson (1995) outlined a diverse set of social and stakeholder issues. He included, for example, employee-related aspects like compensation/rewards, training and development, employment equity, and employee communication. We follow their line of reasoning and have also included meta-analyses beyond a narrow CSP focus. These are, for instance, CEP, ethical corporate governance, and broader employee-related aspects. We did not differentiate as to whether the motives for firm CSP were altruistic or strategic (Baron, 2001; J. W. McGuire, 1969; McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006). In terms of CFP, the studies needed to consider at least one of the following categories: accounting-based performance, market-based performance, operational performance, perceptual performance, growth metrics, risk, or the performance of CSP mutual funds/indices. In cases where the entire meta-analysis was beyond this scope, we extracted only the relevant parts of the whole analysis. Meta-analyses with probit- or logit-correlations were excluded, as transformations to the r-family of correlations result in effect sizes with too large sampling errors. Non-standardized effects, which could not be classified as CSP-CFP sub-effects, were also disregarded for this second-order meta-analysis. Our cut-off date for study inclusion was December 2014. All studies needed to be available in electronic format.

Initially, we applied ancestry research, using widely cited meta- and review studies to extract their cited predecessor studies. The sample was subsequently extended with a forward search in Google Scholar looking for potentially relevant cross-references of so far unknown studies. After that, we performed searches in relevant databases and publisher sites: Academy of Management journals, ABI/Inform, Ebsco, Emerald, Google Scholar, Oxford Journals, Sage, Science Direct, Springer Link, Web of Science, and Wiley, and also searched for non-published manuscripts on Econbiz, National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), Research Papers in Economics (RePEc), and Social Science Research Network (SSRN). We used several search combinations and variations of the term ‘Corporate Social Performance’ including (corporate) sustainability, (corporate) social responsibility, (corporate) governance, (corporate) environmental performance – all in relation to (corporate) financial performance. Of all database queries, we further processed the first 100 hits sorted by relevance. The raw data set of several thousand studies was first reduced for overlapping search hits, and second searched for keywords in the remaining results. We searched for meta, review, literature, overview, analysis, study/ies, and examination. This yielded an overall raw sample of 149 working papers and studies which were analyzed in more detail by examining the abstract or full paper. Seventy-six studies were dropped in the next step, because they either did not contain a relevant CSP-CFP categorization or were single-study designs. The remaining studies were narrowed to the final sample of 25 studies by the exclusion of: (1) 47 narrative reviews and vote-count studies; and (2) meta-studies with non-transferable effect sizes and different paper versions. If different versions of meta-studies with comparable data sets were identified, the latest version remained in our sample. Our search was open to meta-analyses in all asset classes, but it was not possible to locate meta-studies that analyzed other objects than equities. Thus, published (primary) research of the CSP effect in corporate bonds, real estate, and private equity is not considered, as we could not yet identify dedicated meta-analyses.

Our total sample consists of 25 meta-analyses which combined yield a gross number (n m) of 1,902 primary studies. It aggregates 4,507 separate effects (k m) and nearly a million observations (N m = 992,239) (Table 1). Apart from the meta-analytical summary effects, we obtained 129 CSP-CFP sub-effects of first-order meta-analyses, combining in total 2,387,215 observations. Besides the summary and sub-effects at the meta-level, we extracted all provided data at primary study level. Adjusted for overlapping studies and primary studies which either were not made.

transparent by the meta-analyses’ authors (n = 404) or needed manual corrections (n = 38), the final study sample comprises 1214 (n) unique studies. Manual corrections were necessary for author typing errors, different years (i.e. published vs unpublished version), or adding or changing ‘a’ or ‘b’ when two different studies of the same author team appeared in the same year. When retrieving the primary study information from the meta-studies, we coded it in a unique form as author1, author2, …, author i (year). For 45% of studies (n(1) = 551 primary studies), the first-order meta-analyses provided data about effect sizes. On the basis of this information, it was possible to calculate a conventional first-order meta-analysis (so-called second-order omnibus meta-analysis).

# Coding

Besides the basic identifier information: (1) we retrieved a variety of methodological information. This included the meta-analytical approach, the family of reported effect sizes, if and how corrections for sampling and measurement error were taken, and, finally which attenuation factors were used. (2) We collected the granularity of primary studies (transparency level of statistics, all effect sizes, N, k, and t-test). (3) Finally, we gathered all meta-analytical results for summary and sub-effects (effect sizes, attenuated and disattenuated variances, standard errors, credibility and confidence intervals, reliability information of dependent and independent variables, the overall reliability estimate, and results of the homogeneity test, significance tests, and Fail-Safe N analysis). If results for both fixed and random effects were reported, we selected the random effect. All transparent data in primary studies which were also included in a first-order meta-analysis were extracted (e.g. the study identifier and results like study size, effect size(s), and reliabilities). In some cases, rudimentary interpretation was needed. For these cases, two independent coders reviewed the context. The original inter-rater reliability was above 0.9.

# Independence Considerations

An important prerequisite for conducting a second-order meta-analysis is statistical independence of individual first-order meta-analyses. This would require that the primary studies or samples used in one first-order meta-analysis not be included in any of the other analyses (Schmidt & Oh, 2013). In fact, it is a typical case for second-order meta-analyses that this assumption cannot completely be met. Scholars therefore suggest that minimizing the lack of independence might be the best that can be expected (Cooper & Koenka, 2012; Schmidt & Oh, 2013). Various simulation analyses support this approach and find negligible effects of statistical independence violations (Bijmolt & Pieters, 2001; Romano & Kromrey, 2008; Tracz, Elmore, & Pohlmann, 1992).

Our approach for minimizing data dependency applied three steps: meta-analyses selection; average overlap assessment; and the elimination of overlapping studies as a robustness check. First, we selected only the most recent version of a study. We considered multiple contributions from single authors only if they had different research topics or reported different correlation coefficients for the same primary study (Orlitzky, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Orlitzky & Benjamin, 2001). Second, we calculated for every meta-analysis with transparent primary studies the pair-wise overlap to each other. We determined an average overlap of 5.4% of one single meta-analysis to the rest with 78% of pairs having less than 5% overlap. Third, Wilson and Lipsey (2001) reduce disproportionate dependency in second-order meta-analysis by eliminating studies that have more than 25% primary studies in common with other meta-analyses. Thus, we eliminated all meta-analyses with more than 25% overlap to at least one other study. The results of an additional assessment to rule out distorting effects of a potential independence violation are reported in Table 6. We conclude that the level of average non-independence for this study appears small and we have no indication that it could distort effect sizes and variances significantly.

# Analysis and Statistical Models

We calculated summary effects in three alternative ways and also for various subgroups and moderating factors. First, we conducted a second-order omnibus meta-analysis with all primary studies in our meta-analyses sample which contained transparent data for effect sizes. Technically, this is a traditional psychometric first-order.

meta-analysis (Hunter et al., 1982; Schmidt & Hunter, 2015). So-called omnibus meta-analyses have the advantage of established calculation procedures from first-order meta-analysis. Moreover, such analyses yield the same grand mean estimate, provided that all else is equal. But they also suffer from shortcomings like typically scarce data transparency at primary study level and, most important, it is not possible to estimate second-order sampling error variance and correct for it (Schmidt & Oh, 2013). This omnibus meta-analysis, to our knowledge, constitutes the largest meta-analysis in the field hitherto, based on the number of included primary studies. It combines n (1) = 551 studies with N (1) = 152,437 observations retrieved from previous meta-analyses. We utilized this first-order meta-analysis to gain a more granular understanding of the CSP-CFP relation and its statistical variation at primary study level.

Second, we calculated a second-order meta-analysis combining all meta-analytical summary effects of the 25 meta-analyses in our sample (m = 25).

Third, we aggregated all relevant sub-effects of these meta-analyses (m = 129) in various subgroups in order to derive more granular conclusions about the CSP-CFP relation. These sub-effects and their reliability measures provided the foundation for the calculation and correction of a second-order sampling error and the subsequent moderating factor analysis. Moreover, as part of the robustness checks, we analyzed the impact on results when changing from best-effort variances to simple variance estimates. Further documentation on the determination of effect sizes and variances, the correction for measurement error, and the assessment of heterogeneity is provided in online Supplementary Appendix SA.

# Adjusting for the Second-Order Sampling Error

The second-order sampling error is comparable to adjustments for first-order measurement error variance in psychometric meta-analysis. As measurement error is the random deviation of an observed score from a true score, so is the random deviation of first-order meta-effect sizes from its actual second-order average, the second-order sampling error. Thus, the function is comparable to measurement error (Schmidt & Oh, 2013):

bir = rpp bp̿

pi b + pb̿

where pir is the second-order sampling error adjusted for the i-th first-order meta-analytic estimate and unreliability in the first-order meta-analytic results, rpp is the reliability of i first-order meta-analytic values, pi is the i-th first-order meta-analytic estimate, and pb̿ is the second-order grand mean meta-analytic estimate. The reliability coefficient rpp is 1-ProVar, which is calculated as the ratio of b2/S2p σp where b2 σp is the estimate of the actual (non-artifactual) variance across the m-meta-analyses of the population mean-disattenuated correlations. This is the variance that remains after the variance for the second-order sampling error has been subtracted from the variance of mean-disattenuated correlations across the m-meta-analyses (Schmidt & Oh, 2013).

Adjustments for second-order sampling error are useful to reduce the remaining sampling error variance of first-order meta-analyses and therefore produce more accurate estimations of the true mean effect size and (non-artifactual) variance in first-order meta-analyses. These figures are displayed in columns 6–13 of Table 4.

# Moderating Factors

For determining potential moderating factors, the data were split into two or, if necessary, into multiple subgroups. We calculated z-values to identify whether effect size differences among groups are significant. For assessing the potential time dependence of the CSP-CFP relation, we analyzed the effect sizes in dependence of the meta-study publication year and the average publication year of the primary study in each meta-analysis. To rule out a distortion.

of results from changing meta-analytic methods and correction factors over time, the relation was as well assessed on first-order level and in dependency of the publication year.

The number of primary studies in each meta-analysis and its repercussions for the correlation level were analyzed for evaluating the role of sample sizes. The influence of the publishing source was compared for SIM journals versus General Management (GM) journals based on Orlitzky’s (2011) categorization. Since definitions regarding what can be considered as a SIM or GM journal differ (AoM SIM Division, 2012), all publishing journals of the 25 meta-analyses were classified according to the Thomson Reuters’ JCR classification standard. The SSCI subject categories present in our sample (business, environmental studies, ethics, management, political science, and applied psychology) were used to alternatively differentiate the sample of meta-analyses. If a journal was listed in more than one SSCI category, the one where it ranks highest was selected. Furthermore, the JCR 5-Year Journal Impact Factors (2014), the annual citation frequency of the meta-analyses, and the deviation between working papers and published studies were evaluated.

Finally, effect size dependence on methodological quality was evaluated. The methodology quality assessment builds on Aguinis et al. (2011) and transferred those parts of Aguinis et al.’s 21 parameters which could be expressed as dichotomous and qualitative. All parameters which were applied multiple times (e.g. range restrictions) are summarized to one overarching parameter. For each of the parameter identifiable in a meta-study, the meta-study received a score of 1 (present) or 0 (not present). The condensed set contained 11 parameters and therefore yielded a maximum methodological quality score of 11. The total scores for the set of 25 meta-analyses range between 2 and 9.

# Addressing Publication Bias

A general concern of any meta-analysis is that research yielding no significant results remains unpublished (e.g. Dickersin, 2005). Rosenthal (1979) labelled this potential limitation as the file drawer problem, with reference to the many files that remain with the investigator and are not published by journals. We addressed this potential drawback by calculating the Fail-Safe N (or file drawer) statistic, a display of the Funnel Plot, and the inclusion of unpublished literature. Fail-Safe N states the number of (future) studies with null results, until the effect size loses its significance level (Rosenthal, 1979). Rosenthal suggested a tolerance level of 5n+10 for Fail-Safe N to be considered unlikely. The statistic was calculated for all summary and sub-effects. For a visual investigation of publication bias we included as well a funnel plot (Light & Pillemer, 1984; Sutton, 2009). It scatters the study size of a meta-analysis against the effect size. In our case the funnel plot displays all m = 129 sub-effects (number of effects k) against its disattenuated effect size p (Figure 1). The effects are symmetrically distributed around the underlying true effect, with larger variability for smaller studies (and vice versa). As such, we can exclude biases in the data. Furthermore, we applied the Egger test for publication bias, which tests for asymmetry of the funnel plot (Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997). Moreover, we separated attenuated and disattenuated effects from unpublished studies and subgroup the results against published studies (Schmidt & Hunter, 2015). The proportion of these working papers within the total results was notably high. They contributed 28 of the 129 sub-effects. All checks revealed that the results are very likely not be affected by publication bias (Figure 1; Table 5).

# Robustness Checks

The empirical outcomes of this analysis can be considered as fairly robust for a number of reasons. First, we analyzed the impact of switching from our best-effort variances to simple variance estimates (calculation according to Equation 6 in Online Supplement). The results in Table 6 show that our best-effort variances are conservative estimates, which produce lower effect sizes and variances, in particular for disattenuated results. Second, we performed a sensitivity analysis (Aguinis, Gottfredson, & Joo, 2013; Greenhouse & Iyengar, 2009) and recalculated all effects when leaving out the top 5% and bottom 5%, each for effect size and effect size variances. Third, to control for a potential bias through perceptual measures of CFP and CSP, the effects were recalculated by leaving out the complete sample of perceptual CFP and reputational CSP. The results of all three robustness checks indicate that the findings are not distorted by outliers (Table 6).

Figure 1. Funnel plot of meta-analyses’ sub-effects (m = 129) against disattenuated effect size.
Note: Figure 1 scatters the study size of the 129 meta-analysis sub-effects (number of effects k) against its disattenuated effect size p. Effects of published and unpublished studies are displayed separately. The intersection of the axes was moved to the simple average of disattenuated effect sizes (0.179). The effects are relatively symmetrically distributed around the average effect, with larger variability for smaller studies (and vice versa). The larger the number of effects k, the closer the effect sizes are expected to be around the population mean. Effect sizes of unpublished research do not indicate any suppression of unfavourable studies. Apart from a very few outliers, which are additionally accounted for in the Robustness Checks section, the sample is not distorted by publication bias. This visually derived conclusion is supported by the Egger test (Egger et al., 1997) with a calculated p-value for bias of 0.489. [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

# Results

# The General CSP-CFP Relation

We find strong support for Hypothesis 1a. First, the second-order omnibus meta-analysis, which is technically a first-order meta-analysis with n (1) = 551 primary studies, reveals a highly significant (first-order) effect size of ð = 0.119 (Table 2). This number presents the weighted average correlation across all primary studies adjusted for sampling error. When we additionally adjust for meta-analytic artifacts (measurement error for the CSP and CFP figures), we find a disattenuated correlation of p = 0.169. The average effect is highly significant and different from zero. The 95% confidence intervals for this weighted average attenuated correlation range from 0.105 to 0.134 (0.150 to 0.189 for the disattenuated). The 95% credibility interval ranges from -0.206 to 0.444 (-0.284 to 0.624 for the disattenuated). The corresponding variance σ²p of 0.054 (Table 2) is fairly comparable to the simple average of

T. Busch and G. Friede disattenuated correlations in the meta-analyses in our sample of 0.042 (Table 1). The effects are very heterogeneous [Q(1) = 4733 to 9288 and I2 = 0.88 to 0.94].

Second, the aggregation of all summary effects of the meta-analyses in our sample (m = 25) uncovers effect sizes that are very similar to those in the sample of primary studies. We determine an attenuated correlation of r̿ = 0.108 and a disattenuated correlation of pb̿ = 0.150 (Table 3).

Third, the correlations change marginally when the sample of 129 sub-effects from the meta-analyses is aggregated (r̿ = 0.110, pb̿ = 0.157). But unlike effect sizes, (true) variances at second-order level are considerably lower compared to those in the omnibus analysis of primary studies. Second-level variances are only in the range of σb²r̿ = 0.001 to b2b̿ = 0.007 (Table 3). The 95% credibility interval for disattenuated sub-effects ranges from -0.001σp to 0.316. Moreover, in our second-order results, we cannot detect the large heterogeneity of effects anymore that was present in the primary studies. Q and I2 indicate homogeneous relations (Q = 11.4 to 75.5; I2 = 0.00; Table 3).

The third and preferred measure of heterogeneity for psychometric meta-analysis (1-ProVar) still indicates heterogeneity (0.96 to 0.97) – albeit in very small variances, which have low statistical power.

We conclude that all CSP-CFP summary effects, be it first or second order, are highly significant positive. Second-order level variances are furthermore very small with credibility intervals that only by a very thin margin include zero and with effect sizes that are relatively homogeneous.

With respect to Hypothesis 1b, the difference between prior CSP to subsequent CFP (ri = 0.090) vs prior CFP to subsequent CSP (r = 0.098) is small and non-significant (Table 4). We apply two layers of corrections to account for other artifacts besides first-order sampling error. Based on the first-order correction for other artifacts, the relation changes slightly (pbi = 0.128 vs pbi = 0.141). The additional correction for second-order sampling error reveals that the real grand mean correlation is marginally different (pbir = 0.130 vs pbir = 0.143). The difference between both groups fails, with a wide margin, any significance level. We, thus, can rule out that the slack resources hypothesis or the good management hypothesis yields significantly higher results. However, we find the strongest correlation for concurrent CSP and CFP, which supports Hypothesis 1b that there is a virtuous circle between CSP and CFP. The mean correlation for concurrent CSP and CFP, corrected for second-order sampling error, is pbir = 0.159, the highest of the group with the lowest variance.

# The Relation of Various CSP Dimensions and CFP

In line with Hypothesis 2a, we find that studies with social CSP reveal a higher relation (pb i focusing on environmental CSP (pb i = 0.151) (Table 4). However, this difference is small and fails statistical significance (p-value of the difference is 0.388). Thus, Hypothesis 2a is rejected. Opposite to a common notion in the literature, our findings propose that good CSP pays, whether social or environmental related.

Within CSP dimensions, CSP reputation yields the highest relation (pb i = 0.318). The difference to the group average of CSP measures of b̿p = 0.225 is significantly higher at the 99% level (z-value 2.66). However, when we adjust for the 0.80 reliability factor (Table 4, column 12), CSP reputation is marginally adjusted towards pbir = 0.299 to account for the second-order sampling error. Thus, we confirm Hypothesis 2b: reputational aspects have the strongest relation to CFP within the CSP dimensions.

CSP disclosure yields significantly lower correlations (pb i = 0.119) compared to the group average (b̿p = 0.225) at the 99% level (Table 4). On account of the high level of variance artifacts (1-ProVar = 0.58), an adjustment for the second-order sampling error reveals the final, potentially true, correlation level birp supported. Within CSP dimensions, CSP disclosure has the weakest relation to CFP, including second-order sampling error.

# The Relation of CSP and Various CFP Categories

In line with Hypothesis 3a, perceptual performance yields – indeed, by some distance – the highest relation to CFP (pb i = 0.380) (Table 4). It deviates significantly at the 99% level from the CFP group average (p = 0.148), also adjusted for second-order sampling error (pb ir = 0.359). This finding clearly supports Hypothesis 3a: CSP has the strongest link to perceptional CFP than to other CFP categories.

Operational CFP exhibits the highest CSP-CFP relation within the group of objective CFP categories (pbi = 0.222) (Table 4). The deviation with the group average (b̿p = 0.148) is highly significant. Consideration of the second-order sampling error changes the result only negligibly (pb ir = 0.216). This clearly supports Hypothesis 3b.

Accounting-based measures of CFP are more highly correlated (pbi = 0.161) with CSP compared to other market-based measures: growth measures (pbi = 0.124), market-based CFP measures (pb i = 0.115), and risk measures (pb i = 0.062). Even though all these category results are significantly different from zero, market-based CFP and risk measures return significantly lower correlations compared to other CFP measures (Table 4). These findings support Hypothesis 3c.

In accordance with Hypothesis 3d, we obtain the lowest correlation of all CFP categories (b = 0.016) for CSP mutual funds. It is the only result within the CFP categories which is not significantly different from zero. Nonetheless, if we adjust for the low statistical reliability of the CSP mutual fund relation (1-ProVar = 0.00), a correction for the second-order sampling error towards the average group effect b̿p becomes necessary (outlined in Equation 1). The difference between pb i and pb ir of 0.132 could be a reflection of the overall ‘noise’ – whether statistically or capital markets induced. We, thus, support Hypothesis 3d and conclude that mutual funds demonstrate a weaker CSP-CFP relation compared to other CFP categories. Figure 2 graphically summarizes the range and magnitude of the main effect sizes.

# Moderating Factors

Our initial assessment reveals that meta-analyses which are more recent have significantly lower effect sizes compared to older studies. Measured by either the meta-study publication year (pbi = 0.130 vs pbi = 0.216) or the average.

For the purpose of this second-order meta-analysis, we changed the algebraic sign for CFP risk for calculation reasons. The stated positive CSP/CFP risk correlation means in fact a reduced CFP risk with increased CSP.

Note: Unless otherwise stated, the subgroup H1 represents results greater than the respective average of the selected moderating factor. H2 represents the subgroup below the subgroup average. z ri and z pb i are the corresponding z-values for the subgroup means. The additional index (1) indicates the first-order level. See text for abbreviations. The significance values are: *p &lt; 0.10; **p &lt; 0.05; and ***p &lt; 0.01.

publication year of the primary studies in each meta-analysis (pb i = 0.132 vs pbi = 0.194), the results indicate that meta-analyses which are more recent have significantly lower effect sizes (Table 5). However, the attenuation factors applied by the first-order meta-analytical reviewers for these two groups differ considerably. Relatively older meta-analyses used on average an attenuation factor of 0.66 in comparison to younger analyses (0.78). We also assess the relation on first-order level with data on 551 primary studies to rule out a distortion of initial results from changing meta-analytical methods and correction factors over time. This verification uncovers that the pattern of a correlation-level shrink is no longer observable as the differences in r 1 ð ) and p( ) do not exist anymore (0.002 and b 1 -0.002). Based on this extensive set of primary studies that avoids potential distortions through different meta-analytical attenuation factors, Hypothesis 4a cannot be confirmed.

When separating our meta-analytical results into dichotomous groups depending on the number of underlying studies (n), we retrieve two summary effects that are marginally and insignificantly different from each other. Larger studies tend to be negligibly weaker in effect size (pb i = 0.153) in comparison to smaller studies (pbi = 0.160). We conclude that the CSP-CFP relation is not dependent on the study sample size as the difference is non-significant. Larger studies in our sample produce equally strong relations compared to smaller samples which can be interpreted as another sign of the stability of the CSP-CFP relation. Thus, we reject Hypothesis 4b.

As no meta-study in our sample was published in an economics, finance, or accounting journal, we are limited to sub-effects in SIM journals and GM journals. We determine, in contrast to findings at primary study level, even significant lower effect sizes of meta-analyses in SIM journals (p = 0.115) compared to GM journals (pb i = 0.174). These are interesting findings since prior research proposed the opposite. Working paper studies exhibit attenuated effect sizes comparable with those in published papers (r i = 0.115) but disattenuated effect sizes deviate significantly from those in published papers (pbi = 0.186 vs 0.152). Moreover, we find that higher-impact factor journals (factor 5.1 on average for the sample) produce significantly higher correlations than lower-impact factor journals (pb i = 0.177 vs pbi = 0.127).

frequently cited (per annum basis) meta-analyses exhibit very similar effect sizes compared to less often-cited ones. All these findings clearly reject Hypothesis 4c. There is no upwardly distorted CSP-CFP relation through SIM or lower-impact journals.

Finally, regarding the role of judgmental decisions in meta-analyses techniques and methodological choices, we find virtually no difference in effect sizes for methodological stronger (pb i = 0.161) and weaker studies (pb i = 0.153). This finding supports Hypothesis 4d. The CSP-CFP relation exists regardless of the methodological sophistication in meta-analyses. Furthermore, the results of the additional robustness tests suggest that the results are not distorted by statistical outliers (Table 6).

# Discussion and Conclusion

This study makes several contributions to the academic inquiry on whether it pays to be a good firm. First, we are able to claim with more confidence than before that a highly significant, positive, and bidirectional CSP-CFP relation exists. The findings are robust at first-order and, in particular, at second-order meta-analytical level and do not change when we consider potential publication bias, apply less conservative variances, or conduct sensitivity analyses. True variances at second-order level are considerably lower compared to those at first-order level. Thus, the resulting credibility interval is much narrower, with a lower bound virtually at zero (m = 129). We are therefore safely able to claim that in 95% of cases we observe a positive average effect in meta-studies on the CSP-CFP relation. We find no indication that either CSP or CFP matters more from a cause–effect point of view. All three underlying theories (slack resources, good management, and virtuous circle) can empirically be defended. However, the level of effect sizes for a bidirectional relation is highest at the lowest variability of the effects. This leads us to acknowledge the virtuous circle theory as the most probable. To date, the academic CSP-CFP debate is often coined by the notions of ‘contradictory’, ‘mixed’, or ‘ambiguous’ findings. We propose that the business case for CSP can be considered well proved. Research designs taking into account non-linear CSP-CFP relations may even further increase the explanatory power of the CSP-CFP relation (Barnett & Salomon, 2012; Gao, Wu, & Hafsi, 2017; Trumpp & Guenther, 2017; Wagner, Van Phu, Azomahou, & Wehrmeyer, 2002).

Second, we shed light on an academically well-established misinterpretation. We cannot detect statistically significant differences between the effects of environmental and social-related CSP on CFP. This outcome is in contrast to several empirical studies and conceptions which consider social aspects as the main driver for CFP. Our findings propose a different result: good CSP pays off, whether social or environmental related. The difference between both is not statistically significant. This result mirrors S. L. Hart’s (1995) idea of a natural resource-based view and supports other empiric evidence for the business case of improving CEP (Albertini, 2013; Berchicci & King, 2007; Etzion, 2007). It may also be a way for revitalizing the resource-based view (Barney, Ketchen, & Wright, 2011) to acknowledge environmental- and social-related aspects as equally relevant sources for companies’ success.

Third, within CSP dimensions, it is possible to identify different sources for a business case. The strongest relation to CFP is identified for CSP reputation. The intangible character of corporate reputation, which is difficult to replicate and potentially the most overarching outcome measure for CSP, leads to sustained superior financial profit (Melo & Garrido-Morgado, 2012; P. W. Roberts & Dowling, 2002; Sabate & Puente, 2003). On the other hand, the strong correlation for CSP philanthropy reiterates that instrumental and moral initiatives can supplement each other (Brammer & Millington, 2008; Hahn, Pinkse, Preuss, & Figge, 2016). CSP disclosure as well as CSP audits, processes, and policies are significantly weaker correlations compared to the rest of the CSP dimensions. The limited standardization of CSP disclosure practices (Busch, Bauer, & Orlitzky, 2016) seems, in fact, to encourage companies to provide primarily beneficial rather than unbiased CSP information (Schultze & Trommer, 2012; Ullmann, 1985). The significantly weaker correlation of CSP disclosure may point to reliability and validity issues of CSP data. One way of overcoming such data limitations can be to strengthen efforts toward a more stringent – and maybe even obligatory – extra-financial data disclosure. Standardization efforts of the Sustainable Accountings Standards Board (SASB, 2015) and the European Union (EU, 2014) are promising steps forward in this regard.

# Corporate social and financial performance

Fourth, our findings suggest that operational performance is significantly and more highly correlated to CSP than other CFP categories. This finding mirrors other researchers’ claims that operational performance such as productivity is located closer to the value creation source within a firm; it better reflects organizational performance than potentially distorted CFP categories like accounting- or market-based measures (McWilliams et al., 1999; Peloza, 2009; Rowley & Berman, 2000; Venkatraman & Ramanujam, 1986).

Fifth, it is an interesting phenomenon that correlations shrink for different CFP categories – perceptual performance having the highest correlation and CSP mutual funds the lowest. The closer research gets to realized market performance, the smaller the effects. Several reasons may explain why empirical studies on CSP mutual funds exhibit a relatively weak CSP-CFP relation. Realized performance in mutual funds depends on the overlapping effects of systematic and idiosyncratic risks (Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, & Xu, 2001; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009), construction constraints (Clarke, de Silva, & Thorley, 2002), and costs for portfolio implementation which can be as high as 2.5% per annum in various fees that are carried by the average mutual fund (Barber, Odean, & Zheng, 2005; Carhart, 1997; Khorana, Servaes, & Tufano, 2009). The ‘drowned out by other noise’ argument (Peloza, 2009, p. 1527) thus seems to be even more valid for mutual funds, which are the ultimate amalgam of market-based measures. Nevertheless, in the worst case, mutual funds investors could expect to lose nothing compared to conventional mutual fund investments.

Sixth, we expected that early published analyses would show greater effect sizes compared with subsequently published meta-analyses. This potential diminishing effect over time as data accumulate is well documented (Trikalinos & Ioannidis, 2005). Indeed, we find significantly lower correlations for more recent meta-studies compared to older studies. However, the additional analysis at primary study level (n = 551) revealed that the shrinkage in correlations in the meta-analyses most likely does not indicate a shrinkage of the actual CSP-CFP relation. Correlations at primary study level, in contrast to our findings at the meta-study level, do not shrink. One explanation for this finding is that more recent meta-analytical research methods have become more sophisticated though using higher attenuation factors.

Finally, there was the suspicion raised that evidence of the CSP-CFP relation depends on the kind of publishing journal. The speculation was that SIM journals tend to publish ‘better results’. Interestingly, we find the opposite result: ‘truth is not made’ in special SIM journals and low-impact factor journals, but rather, in particular, in high-impact factor and general management journals, at least at a meta-analysis level. We did not discover any publication bias analyzed by Fail Safe, funnel plot, or with regards to the publishing status of a paper. In line with previous findings (Aguinis et al., 2011; Lipsey & Wilson, 1993), we also reveal that the methodological quality of meta-analyses has no influence on the reported effect sizes.

Concluding, this study takes an instrumental point of view: we ask whether it pays to be good and find that in fact it does. In light of the urgent global challenges that society faces, it appears essential that firms and investors consider any action possible to safeguard the living conditions for future generations. They can be encouraged that on first glance competing instrumental and moral motivations can supplement each other.

# Abstract

Corporate sustainability is considered a fundamental paradigm and solution in creating a prosperous future for organizations. However, social sustainability issues and pandemic problems from COVID-19 have affected corporations and interrupted plans for sustainable development. To date, corporate sustainability frameworks have taken a relatively narrow view of this paradigm. This study highlights serious challenges to corporate sustainability while providing a framework in an attempt to enable more sustainable business practices. To fill the gap in the literature, we have developed a framework to organize and prioritize important sustainability indicators. The first phase of the study involves the classification of 45 sub-criteria of corporate sustainability under nine main categories by using a literature review and novel Fuzzy Delphi method. The resulting categories are Corporate Governance, Product Responsibility, Transparency and Communication, Economic, Environmental, Social, Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability, Energy Consumption along with Energy Saving, and includes Pandemic COVID-19 as a new aspect of social sustainability. Next, we applied the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) to help determine the weights and prioritizing the criteria and sub-criteria. The results revealed that the Pandemic, along with the Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability, ranked higher among the main criteria category. Whereas, emergency response planning, social distances, modification of working hours, and just-in-time delivery are the most influencing sub-attributes among the 45 sub-barriers of different categories. Contributions of this study include new insights regarding corporate sustainability criteria and subcriteria, application of novel methods, and integrated framework for dimensions of corporate sustainability. This study is among the first of its kind to consider the COVID-19 pandemic as an essential category and social sustainability attribute of corporate sustainable business practices. Outcomes of this study can help assist scholars, corporations, and decision-makers in understanding sustainable development initiatives while simultaneously improving social sustainability practices.

# 1. Introduction

Sustainable development is the potential to fulfill today’s needs without undermining a future generation’s ability to satisfy their needs[1]. Sustainability has become a significant alternative to business as usual, which appears to focus primarily on short-term productivity with little or no social and environmental impacts considered over the long term[2]. Despite this, the business environment.

Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

is changing rapidly, guided by social, economic, and ecological developments [3, 4]. For these and other aligned reasons, companies have become increasingly interested in corporate sustainability; see, for example, Christ et al. [5] and Manrique and Martí-Ballester [6]. While managers have noticed that the integration of sustainability is an opportunity, they rarely consider it in tactical management decisions [7]. The consideration of sustainability in corporate strategy and processes has become one promising way of dealing with a changing business landscape and increasing pressure for social sustainability performance. Since decisions relating to sustainability are made at a strategic level, there has also been an increasing scientific interest in the field of strategic management in connection with the inclusion of sustainability in the strategy, vision, change management, and culture of a company [8].

Due to the variety of different sustainability initiatives, there is an ongoing opportunity for researchers to quantify what ongoing and emerging practices look like [9]. Yet, there has been so much published by researchers that it can be an overwhelming amount of information to sort through. Add to this, the idea that stakeholders are continually seeking more information beyond financial performance by wanting to see the ecological and social policies of a company [10], and the importance of understanding corporate sustainability continues to grow. Corporate sustainability reporting can be a primary motivation for organizations to communicate with stakeholders about sustainability initiatives. This gets difficult due to the terminology and growing categories of these diverse efforts. For example, firms have been reporting the use of different terminologies, e.g., corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainable development (SD), economic and non-economic reporting, and referring to the main pillars of sustainability which are social, environmental, and economic (SEE), and triple bottom line (TBL). The evolution of such reporting is fascinating. Tschopp and Huefner [11] found that the companies were focusing on environmental management compliance reporting during the 1970s and 1980s, and they also observed a weak relation between sustainability reporting and organization performance. Later, in the 1990s, sustainability reporting on occupational health and safety (OHS) was observed, and a paradigm shift to reporting on societal-based activities, accompanied by institutionalization.

Considering that each participant in society has its unique responsibility to engage sustainable development at a global scale, corporate sustainability reflects the organizations’ part to global challenges of sustainable development [12], including depletion of natural resources and social sustainability. There are several challenges regarding corporate sustainability, such as the need for considering both external and internal stakeholders in corporate decisions [13]; to resolve discrepancies, contradictions, and synergies among the three pillars of TBL sustainability [14]; to promote an approach to corporate sustainability based in moral-values [15]; to foster corporate social responsibility across the business life-cycle thinking [16]. Add to this, the several contributions available in the literature from different epistemological fields connected with environmental, economic, and social performance, and it seems evident that there is an absence of coordination among them. Diouf et al. [17] emphasized the growing significance of sustainability reporting and the use of international regulations, targets for reducing carbon emissions, and international standards and guidelines. Arribas et al. [18] investigated that the inclusion of irresponsible companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) from S&P Dow Jones Indices, and Social Accountability (SA8000) from Social Accountability International—SAI (2008) is a fact.

Those who manage business decisions face multiple criteria for achieving the best practices while trying to achieve multiple goals. Decisions regarding sustainable business practices have multi-level characteristics as TBL dimensions can be broken down into hierarchical variables [19]. One primary objective of this study is to help researchers and practitioners identify essential corporate sustainability criteria. Therefore, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is recommended for simultaneously addressing decisions with multiple objectives and multiple criteria. Multi-criteria decision theory helps to orchestrate the various awareness of practices involving sustainability [20] and to help when making decisions regarding dynamic topics. Multi-stakeholder, multi-objective, and multi-level frameworks have been developed and utilized in the literature to assess corporate sustainability results but, so far,

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

the initiatives have not provided a consistent, single measure capturing the TBL’s complexities and integrating the MCDA. Therefore, the second objective of this study is to provide a methodology to help organize and understand this dynamic context for sustainable business practices.

Add to this dynamic context, a global pandemic and things can get interesting. Due to the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak, the modern world is suffering a global economic crisis with well over 9 million cases, and over 501,000 fatalities as of September 2020 affecting more than 200 countries [21]. Many businesses have shut down, and the rate of unemployment has increased. According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has become an unparalleled global crisis and is challenging organizations, which ultimately can have a negative effect on corporate sustainability and business practices [22]. Until now, corporations have not had to plan for a pandemic. Moreover, corporate sustainability has been marginalized due to organizations, governments, and society struggling to survive in times of a pandemic. Researchers have stated that the COVID-19 pandemic is opening new challenges for corporate sustainability, mainly because supply chains and their manufacturers are facing the pandemic’s negative effects, such as market downturn, SMEs bankruptcy, employees’ resignations, revenue loss, to name a few. Therefore, we see the post-COVID-19 era as an opportunity by which organizations can rethink their sustainable business practices concerning a shift in their manufacturing, supply chain, and sustainability strategies. Here we find the third objective for this study to extend our understanding of corporate sustainability by also exploring the more recent impacts of the pandemic.

Researchers, policymakers, and decision-makers are now more concerned about how to make corporations more sustainable. This study is an attempt to help decision-makers and researchers by developing a framework for corporations regarding social sustainability dimensions that include COVID-19 as a new attribute of sustainable business practices. Many aspects of corporate sustainability can be measured to calculate the company’s sustainability efficiency. In this study of corporate sustainability, we assess this paradigm using (i) Governance; (ii) Product Responsibility; (iii) Transparency and Communication; (iv) Economic; (v) Environmental; (vi) Social; (vii) Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability; (viii) Energy Consumption and Saving, and a new criterion, (ix) Pandemic COVID-19. These nine aspects are further divided into forty-five sub-criteria. In doing so, one contribution of this study is the addition of values for these major criteria and sub-criteria as we attempt to fill a gap in the corporate sustainability literature. As a partial response to the recent and growing call for understanding the pandemic COVID-19 effects on businesses, the authors conducted this research aiming to contribute to the growing literature on the topic by developing a multidimensional framework for corporate sustainability. Further, this study prioritizes the main and sub-attributes of an emerging sustainability model by being among the first to use MCDA techniques.

To help start us down a path to understanding this dynamic context for corporate sustainability, fundamental factors can be identified from the literature and further classified as a foundation for understanding corporate sustainability. In this study, we draw from the literature to develop lists of main and sub-attributes essential for developing corporate sustainability business practices. Building on our objectives for this study, our primary research questions include, but are not limited, to what are the most influenceable metrics for corporate sustainability? And how can they be evaluated and ranked in a way that provide value to practitioners and scholars? After reviewing the literature, conceptual models, our research framework, and applying a Fuzzy Delphi method, we assess nine sustainability criteria and forty-five sub-criteria. We review our methods for employing the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) for calculations of weights for both the sub-criteria using a matrix of pairwise comparisons. Results are then discussed, and the last section provides main conclusions, contributions to the field, and avenues for aspects of corporate sustainability, social sustainability, and sustainable development for future researches.

# 2. Literature Review

The definitions of sustainability have many interpretations, such as environmental protection, ecosystem resources, economic concerns, social acceptance, licensing and externalities, and many other perspectives. The recent literature shows that sustainable development is going beyond “green” to a more comprehensive, systematic, methodological, and integrated understanding of sustainability.

Researchers and decision-makers are aware of the need for systematic sustainability assessments to evaluate complex systems to replace traditional and unsustainable business practices. Such assessments ultimately concentrate on historical strategies for sustainability, demonstrating the need to improve corporate sustainability programs over time, along with allocating resources that reduce sustainability risks. Further, organizations need to combine efficiency and market performance initiatives to develop strategic corporate sustainability opportunities [23].

Asif et al. [24], conceptualized the integration of economic, social, and environmental bottom lines dimension by using a triple bottom line. This view of a corporation means that the efficiency and sustainability aspects of the integrated structure are matched together. Several models have been proposed to develop corporate sustainability in efforts to make it accessible, practical, and quantifiable. The wide range of sustainability frameworks is because of the variety of definitions of sustainable development, i.e. ecological sustainability, environmental efficiency, corporate citizenship, and TBL.

In prior studies, one dimension of corporate sustainability is evaluated to define, measure, and sometimes test constructs and relationships. For instance, environmental sustainability frameworks concentrate on environmental issues by providing metrics for mitigating pollution, climate vulnerability, environmental degradation, land use, and loss of biodiversity [25]. Social sustainability models focus on societal and ethical facets of corporate sustainability, such as infrastructure, community welfare, human rights, health, equity, and education [26]. Further, economic sustainability involves the economic structure of organizations and concentrates on businesses seeking to optimize the company’s resources through social and environmental strategies [27]. Some studies proposed the two-dimensional sustainability frameworks in which two or more dimensions of corporate sustainability (such as environmental and social dimensions evaluated by providing sustainability indices and MCDA approaches). The fundamental model of corporate sustainability is shown in Figure 1.

Concerns regarding the social and environmental effects of sustainability must be weighted, but economic viability should not be threatened. The company’s financial performance can be affected and impacts its risk of survival if it fails to give due attention to its economic performance [28]. Longoni and Cagliano [29] argued that managing and balancing TBL performance is paramount. The authors acknowledge the difficulties of doing this while also trying to understand any negative tradeoffs between the three sustainability dimensions.

The International Organization of Standardization (ISO) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) systems assist companies in integrating sustainable development and TBL performance. GRI measures and reports the “material” performance of companies and its business activities and its effectiveness in multiple dimensions, i.e., three folds result to the public, most of the time through sustainability reports [30]. Several sustainability indices have been developed to highlight sustainability activities so that investors can consider the sustainable performance of enterprises. By analyzing the sustainability practices by each corporation, the sustainability indices act as a knowledge intermediary of companies with their different players (including business specialists, shareholders, and financial intermediaries). Specialized data accessed by neutral parties are seen by these intermediaries as objective. Conventional definitions of sustainability suggest that the businesses are supposed to be listed only if they are more socially and environmentally responsible than their competitors within these stock indexes. Sustainability stock indexes can, therefore, be treated as suitable sustainability performance indicators. Weber [31] suggests sustainability guidance that describes the most relevant performance metrics and issues in six banking industries. They showed specific important issues are shared by many industries, particularly social sustainability aspects, whereas others are unique in a sector.

Several researchers have used MCDA methods to measure the company’s sustainability performance. A list of different MCDA approaches used to develop a sustainability framework is shown in Table 1.

Previously, before the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations, governments, and society were dealing with and focusing on environmental issues. It is believed that, after the COVID-19 pandemic, business transitions will increase in order to achieve a more sustainable corporate sustainability. This transition will allow organizations to develop flexible manufacturing systems, prioritizing environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Regarding decision support systems for resilient production, there are various options available, such as those proposed by Tan et al. [52] and the prediction model for supply chains of Ivanov et al. [53]. Thus, companies and supply chains need to be resilient to tackle tough times, such as what occurs during the current pandemic.

As expected, the economic crisis that followed the COVID-19 epidemic affected several businesses, from manufacturers to service providers due to the social distancing and lockdowns [54]. Thus, the businesses in which customers interact with each other were immediately stopped [55, 56]. To avoid bankruptcy, these businesses moved to palliative solutions aiming for their survival, mainly migrating the businesses to digital platforms [57].

The epidemic effects on delivery delays are affecting supply chains, causing bullwhip effects, and unbalancing organizations’ performances in almost all industries. Thus, companies are focusing on essential items for manufacturing and maintaining supply activities regarding the unexpected disruptions. At the same time, these organizations are planning how to restart the businesses close to the ‘new normal’, as society is returning to (a semi) normality.

The main justification for considering the COVID-19 pandemic effects in corporate sustainability, within this study, is that its consequences will be felt for decades [58]. Thus, as a long-lasting event, it is assumed that the COVID-19 pandemic will affect organizations regarding their sustainability actions in the future.

We considered various decision attributes and indicators for the development of a multidimensional sustainability framework. These attributes can assist in the construction of an effective corporate sustainability model while also providing insights into sustainable business practices. This study develops a decision criterion for sustainable development based on the literature and then checked the criteria validity provided by key expert’s contributions. The main sustainability criteria in our development of a sustainability framework include Corporate Governance, Product Responsibility, Transparency and Communication, Economics, Social, Environmental, Natural Environmental and Climate Change, Energy Saving and Consumption, and what we believe to be used for the first time, the COVID-19 pandemic criteria. As per the best of the authors’ knowledge, pandemic impacts have not been used before in sustainability models to date, the consideration of COVID-19 pandemic effects will help to fulfill a gap in the literature.

Each of these sustainability criteria has a total of forty-five sub-criteria. These criteria were identified after reviewing and summarizing the literature. The results of which criteria and sub-criteria are shown in Table 2. Next, we attempt to extend the corporate sustainability model based on the ‘Plan, Do, Check, and Act’ (PDCA) approach, as presented in Figure 2.

# 3. Research Framework

We have used the Fuzzy Delphi, and FAHP approaches to finalize and prioritize the most important criteria and select sustainability options for the development of corporate sustainability. The framework operationalized in this study is shown in Figure 3. Fuzzy Delphi proposed by Hsu et al. [88] has been adopted in this study to finalize corporate sustainability criteria. The advantage of Fuzzy Delphi over the conventional Delphi method is that the latter is a lengthy process of obtaining a consensus on experts’ opinions. The expert’s opinion in the conventional Delphi method often suffers from low convergence, which ultimately complicates consensus-building. The experts are therefore consulted repeatedly to reform their feedback so that a possible consensus can be reached. On the other hand, Fuzzy Delphi can obtain experts’ consensus through only one round of investigation [89]. The Fuzzy Delphi uses membership functions to characterize the experts’ feedback. In this way, experts are not consulted twice to alter their opinions, which also saves useful information from being lost as all the experts’ opinions are taken while computing the membership degrees.

Regarding the development of the fuzzy membership degrees, most of the previous studies used a Triangular Fuzzy Number (TFN), Gaussian fuzzy number, and trapezoidal fuzzy number [88]. This study employs TFNs, to construct the membership degree function. To find the converging point of the decision group, TFNs were solved using the geometric mean following previous studies such as [90,91]. In taking this approach, a FAHP methodology was used for computing the weights of the main and sub-attributes of corporate sustainability, supported by decision-makers, using a pairwise comparison matrix. To carry out the analysis, eight academic and industrial experts were involved whose detail is provided in Appendix A (see Table A1).

# Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process

The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a well-known and adaptable Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach to solve complex problems used across a variety of fields of research. The logic of AHP is based on a ratio scale to quantify the different sets of alternatives priorities provided by decision-makers [92]. This approach evaluates the consistency and importance of the decision-makers’ instinctive opinions to provide an optimal solution for complex problems. Researchers have integrated the AHP approach with other methods, such as grey system theory, data analysis envelopment, fuzzy system theory, and even linear programming [93].

Although AHP methods have shown satisfactory results and can be used to evaluate decision-makers’ opinions, this technique has some deficiencies in terms of human behavior and thinking approach. Hence, the traditional method has some limitations, such as (i) handling with the inconsistent and unbalanced expert opinion scale, (ii) unable to handle the uncertain and ambiguous relationship with expert’s judgment numbers, (iii) imprecise results, and (iv) decision-makers’ subjective opinion preferences.

Due to these limitations, AHP has evolved into FAHP, as a widely used and more accurate approach over conventional methods to solve uncertain and complex problems involving a decision-maker’s judgment. FAHP is the combination of traditional AHP and Fuzzy set theory, where the membership of each element is represented by a function. Further, each element of the membership function is divided into the membership’s degree with a value between 0 and 1, which implies that any membership’s element has a value of “1”. Conversely, any element has no membership with a “0” value. Those elements which lie between “0 and 1” have a partial or incomplete degree of membership [94]. To effectively handle the uncertainties during the logistic estimation process, there is a need to convert the linguistic term of membership function into ‘fuzzy numbers’, meanwhile, in FAHP, linguistic values are shown as a TFN.

To develop corporate sustainability for the purposes of this study, FAHP was applied to estimate weights of criteria and sub-criteria in the six following steps:

1. Designing the problem structure using a hierarchical approach
2. Constructing of pairwise comparison matrix and developing the scale of the relative importance

After designing the problem structure in a hierarchical way, the next step is to define the scale of relative importance in order to construct a pairwise comparison matrix. Table 3 presents the TFN, which are from 1 to 9, and are used to improve the accuracy of the traditional model. We employed (˜ 3, 5, 7, 9) relative to correspondence number for expert qualitative assessment in five TFNs in order to capture the vagueness and remove uncertainties. The fuzzy membership for attributes and sub-attributes is shown in Figure 4.

# Step III. Constructing a fuzzy-based matrix for comparison purposes

Experts used the TFNs to elaborate pairwise comparisons of corporate sustainability main and sub-attributes. The fuzzy comparison matrix X was drawn from the expert’s opinions by using the arithmetic mean function for pairwise comparison, as presented in Equation (1).

|∼|…|b1n|
|---|---|---|
|∼|…|b12|
|∼|…|…|
|X =|…|…|

where b∼ij = 1, if i = j, and b∼ij = 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1, if i ≠ j. To calculate the scores for a pair, a reverse comparison was applied in the matrix for giving a reciprocal score.

# Step IV. Developing the crisp comparison matrix Xij

To make the expert and decision-makers judgments more confident, the α-cut method can be used through the ranking of fuzzy numbers, in which it provides an interval of values based on fuzzy numbers. Figure 5 presented the α-cut method on TFN for this instance, if α = 0.5 will yield a0.5 = (2, 3, 4).

# 4. Results and Discussion

This research used multiple methods to develop a corporate sustainability framework that assists policymakers, government, decision-makers, and managers, to effectively develop sustainability and make better decisions in implementing sustainable business practices. This study is the first of its kind to develop a multidimensional corporate sustainability model based on important sustainability indicators that include pandemic information due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Further, this study identifies and assesses valuable sustainability options retrieved from literature and experts’ knowledge to provide the most suitable sustainability practices for making corporate sustainability resilient. Our investigation is a roadmap for organizations and policymakers in the contemporary world aiming to determine further applications based on our findings, which provides a more rational solution for the development of corporate sustainability.

# 4.1. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process Results

Our analysis started by using the FAHP method based on a pairwise comparison matrix. This matrix was built for determining individual expert scores through a geometric mean approach. The group-based decision-making approach was adopted for calculations of sustainability attributes and sub-attributes weights. Supported by experts and analyzing the related literature review, we can classify nine main sustainability attributes, i.e., Corporate Governance, Environment, Social, Economic, Product Responsibility, Natural Environment and Climate, Energy Consumption and Saving, Transparency and Communication, and COVID-19 pandemic. The first phase of the FAHP method comprises the calculation of the nine most important criteria’s weights and, at the second stage, we determined the 45 sub-attributes weights in total. Figure 6 presents the hierarchal structure of corporate sustainability with the main attributes and sub-attributes.

# 4.2. Prioritizing Main Attributes

The FAHP computed the weight of each sustainability attribute in a hierarchical structure. The main attributes are presented in Table 5 and reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic is the most important criteria by obtaining the highest weight of 0.4129. The importance of criteria were as follows: Economic (0.3754), Corporate Governance (0.2532), Natural Environment and Climate (0.2195),

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

Environmental (ENV), Energy Consumption and Saving (0.1775), Transparency and Communication (0.1210), Social (0.0542), and Product Responsibility (0.0492) criteria, respectively. The details of each main sustainability indicator’s weights are presented in Table 5. The rapid spreading of the pandemic involving COVID-19 is the most influential barrier disrupting corporate sustainability. The pandemic has affected overall business performances. Economic sustainability and governance was the second most important indicator in our analysis. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects, it brings new challenges for corporations to affect their ability to operationalize sustainability. In addition to new compliance and regulatory parameters, it appears to be a mandatory part of corporate sustainability in the organization. Therefore, corporations need to develop a corporate sustainability system in order to cope with these new issues and enable more sustainable business practices.

# Table 5. Main corporate sustainability attributes.

|Main Criteria|Code|Weight|Rank|
|---|---|---|---|
|Pandemic|PEN|0.4129|1st|
|Corporate Governance|CGOV|0.2532|3rd|
|Product Responsibility|PR|0.0492|9th|
|Transparency and Communication|TC|0.1210|7th|
|Economic|EC|0.3754|2nd|
|Environmental|ENV|0.1871|5th|
|Social|SOC|0.0542|8th|
|Natural Environment & Climate|NEC|0.2195|4th|
|Energy Consumption and Saving|ECS|0.1775|6th|

According to the calculation of the main sustainability attributes’ weights, the Pandemic attribute came first in the main corporate sustainability criteria. To this end, organizations should develop an emergency response plan to tackle any emergency, which may become a hurdle in the effective implementation of corporate sustainability. Hence, organizations should develop a sustainable structure that can prevent the organization from crises. Moreover, organizations should also implement suitable and long-lasting sustainability practices that assure optimal progress toward sustainability and provide benefits while utilizing scarce resources. Further, it was observed that the delivery time of goods supplies has been drastically disrupted due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, organizations need to develop a sustainable delivery system like just-in-time (JIT), which provides a more resilient solution during any emergency faced by the organization. Economic sustainability, governance, and natural environment and climate took their position after the pandemic attribute. Whereas product responsibility came last and observed the least essential attributes by obtaining the lowest weight (0.0492). The 45 sub-attributes of the study were evaluated through with the help of expert’s opinion, according to the pairwise comparisons matrix.

# The Prioritizing of Sub-Attributes

The ranking of sub-attributes of corporate sustainability is presented in Figures 7–15.

# Governance sub-attributes:

We identified the sub-attributes ranking (GOV) as following:

GOV4 > GOV1 > GOV3 > GOV7 > GOV5 > GOV2 > GOV6.

Management and audit of corporate governance (GOV4) obtained the highest score (0.4132) and is considered the main influencing sub-attribute of its category. The outcome proved that face validity is an accurate justification as audit expertise, then skilled personnel are credited for corporate sustainability actions.

# Sustainability 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

Skilled personnel are credited for corporate sustainability actions. In the same way, the businesses must address governance and strengthening it since governance is responsible for guiding companies towards sustainability. Another high score observed with sub-criteria in this category is the corporate governance report (GOV1), with a weight of 0.3884. Corporate award and recognition (GOV3) showed a score of 0.3732, standing at the top-three most important sub-criteria of this category (as seen in Figure 7). Investors are evaluating both economic and financial returns on investments (ROI), but the valuation of investees' reputation is increasing. Then, reputation is positively influenced by corporate sustainability governance at high standards (Gottschalk, 2011). Public Private Partnership on sustainability (GOV7) received a score of 0.2351, putting this sub-attribute at the fourth position of most important sub-attributes. Moreover, corporate governance accountability (GOV5) showed a score of 0.1717, being the fifth most important sub-attribute in this category. The structure and dynamics of corporate governance (GOV2) and conduct and conflict of interest in corporate governance (GOV6) are the least influencing sub-criteria, obtaining the weights of 0.1653 and 0.1089, respectively. The decision for a given company for engaging corporate sustainability governance depends on the achievements of the corporate goals. In this way, [97] underlined that a company’s sustainability is influenced by the stakeholder’s sustainability. Additionally, relations with stakeholders must be considered key for decision-making processes which, in turn, support the establishment of corporate strategies.

|Conflict of interest in corporate governance-GOV6|0.1089|
|---|---|
|Structure and dynamics of corporate governance-GOV2|0.1653|
|Corporate governance accountability-GOV5|0.1717|
|Public Private Partnership on sustainability-GOV7|0.2351|

|Corporate governance report-GOV1|0.3884|
|Management and audit of corporate governance-GOV4|0.4132|

Figure 7. Governance Sub-criteria.

# Product Responsibility

Under the Product responsibility (PR) category, we obtained the following sub-criteria ranking: PR4>PR3>PR5>PR2>PR1, as presented in Figure 8. Product research and development (PR4) is seen as a challenge in supporting the development of corporate sustainability infrastructure, with a score of 0.4102. The next sub-criteria that received the highest score is the compliance with products and policies (PR3) category, with a weight of 0.3297. Product complaint mechanism (PR5) received a score of 0.1737, being the third most important sub-criteria. Following this, indirect impacts of the product (PR2) reached the fourth position (within Product Responsibility category) with a weight of 0.1321. The fifth most important sub-attribute came from the personal impacts of product use (PR1) with a weight of 0.0952. Then, the first phases of product-innovation processes, as well as decision-making processes, must address a sustainability perspective in order to introduce a sustainability paradigm into the business’s practices. Additionally, organizations must incorporate a long-term perspective when considering sustainability as a strategic asset for businesses [98].

# Transparency and Communication

As shown in Figure 9, the ranking of sub-attribute within Transparency and Communication is TC4>TC3>TC1>TC2>TC5, with a consistency ratio of 0.0107. Transparency of general reports (TC4) reached the first position in the Transparency and Communication category, showing a score of 0.4321. Moreover, strategic perspectives after transparency of general reports (TC3) is in the second position, reaching a score of 0.3487. Following, commitments to the community (TC1) and alignment of commitments (TC2) are ranked at the third and fourth.

positions, obtaining a score of 0.2175 and 0.1564, respectively. Finally, ethics and citizenship (TC5) are considered the least influencing sub-criteria with a score of 0.1324. Thus, sustainability supports knowledge creation and sharing, which, in turn, eases communication within organizations. To make a proactive sustainability strategy realistic, Kim and Ji [99] suggested that corporations aiming for a proactive sustainability strategy must consider the communication of a shared vision within an organization and among the company’s stakeholders. When companies communicate their visions related to sustainability, they improve their reputation which increases stakeholders’ interests in such organizations. Moreover, Dyllick and Muff [100] stated that corporate sustainability mission and vision statements should be adopted to convey corporate commitment throughout the corporation. Then, top managers have to consider sustainability goals in the company’s core values in order to align the company’s motivations, strategic goals, and responsibilities related to customers, employees, and society, as well as stakeholders. Companies need to address sustainability due it inspires commitments through proactive sustainability strategies.

# Economics

The outcomes showed the sub-attribute ranking: ECO4>ECO2>ECO6>ECO5> ECO1>ECO3, as seen in Figure 10. Firstly, risks and the management of economic and financial performance (ECO4) has a weight of 0.4932, whereas CSR and sustainability activities expenditure (ECO2) are ranked in the second position with a score of 0.4321. Economic difficulties are explained due to the financial resources required for sustainability development. Results showed that sustainability is directly related to costs (such as costs with audit, training, certification) and indirectly related to commitments through proactive sustainability strategies.

Economic difficulties are explained due to the financial resources required for sustainability development.

Results showed that sustainability is directly related to costs (such as costs with audit, training, certification) and indirectly related to operational and social resources, skilled personnel, preventive actions, and regulations adherence. The legal compliance with economic and financial aspects (ECO6) and economic and financial statements (ECO5) is considered at the third and fourth positions within the sub-criteria category of economics with a score of 0.2383 and 0.1894, respectively. Lastly, the development and impact of infrastructure investments (ECO1) and economic and financial policy and strategy (ECO3) with a weight of 0.1765 and 0.1634, respectively. Sustainability actions are the basic elements for putting the economic dimension into practice, and these actions consider profitability, financial stability and liquidity, and financial benefits [101]. Therefore, the CSR spending, the management of innovation and technology, knowledge management, collaborations, organizational processes management, and elaboration of sustainability reports are some of the relevant actions towards corporate sustainability [102].

# Environment

Results showed the ranking within the Environmental dimension of corporate sustainability are as follows: ENV1>ENV4>ENV3>ENV2>ENV5, as shown in Figure 11. The highest weight, 0.5321, obtained of sub-criteria within the environment category is initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (ENV1). Compliance with environmental regulations (ENV4) reported the second sub-criteria in the row with a weight of 0.4654. Whereas, environmental management and responsibility (ENV3) sub-barrier and commitment, scope, and dissemination of environmental policy (ENV2) are ranked at third and fourth positions, within the environmental sustainability category, presenting a score of 0.3936 and 0.3381, respectively. Finally, environmental cost-saving operations (ENV5) come fifth in the row with a weight of 0.2101. Government regulations have been the primary drivers of a part of corporate sustainability. Literature showed that environmental sustainability provides cost reductions for the businesses, and these reductions are related to the use of energy, raw materials, and water, as well as reducing waste generation. Environmental sustainability improves the company’s reputation for stakeholders and into the market which, in turn, eases acquiring new customers prone to environmental issues. The incorporation of EMS by companies leads to CO2 emission reductions as well as a reduction in pollution [103,104].

# Social

Figure 12 shows the outcomes, ranking the sub-criteria as follows: SOC1>SOC4>SOC5>SOC2>SOC3. The highest sub-attribute of social criteria is the commitment to societal development (SOC1) with a weight of 0.5464. Training employees through in-house programs (SOC4) is ranked at the second position, presenting a score of 0.4821. Companies must train their personnel to work in an integrated way. Additionally, companies must use integration between auditing services and administration support for building stronger relationships with stakeholders. These relations promote efficiency, may save resources, and provide assertiveness amongst personnel.

Whereas commitment to HR development (SOC5) is ranked as the third most important sub-criterium, showing a score of 0.3410. Human resources (HR) have a crucial role in the implementation of sustainability by companies [105]. The companies aiming the implementation of sustainability must address the commitment from top managers, supportive actions towards training, personnel empowerment, and teamwork in areas such as Quality Management. Labor relations and with society (SOC2) as well as diversity and equity, supplier management, and resolution of society’s demands (SOC3) are ranked into the fourth and fifth positions, presenting scores of 0.3241 and 0.2146, respectively. Here, we see a strong relationship with suppliers, which emphasizes the need for developing an integrative decision support program for managing the supply chain, taking into account the stakeholders that strategically improve the company’s production processes and balance the supplier sustainability system.

# Natural Environment and Climate:

Under the natural environment and climate change category, results showed in Figure 13 allowed the identification of the following ranking: NEC1>NEC3>NEC2>NEC4. Commitment to climate change (NEC1) is presented as the highest score of sustainability by companies [105]. The companies aiming the implementation of sustainability must address the commitment from top managers, supportive actions towards training, personnel empowerment, and teamwork in areas such as Quality Management. Labor relations and with society (SOC2) as well as diversity and equity, supplier management, and resolution of society’s demands (SOC3) are ranked into the fourth and fifth positions, presenting scores of 0.3241 and 0.2146, respectively. Here, we see a strong relationship with suppliers, which emphasizes the need for developing an integrative decision support program for managing the supply chain, taking into account the stakeholders that strategically improve the company’s production processes and balance the supplier sustainability system.

monitoring effective systems. Moreover, climate change is usually considered an important threat in society and nature, more critical than biodiversity loss. Regarding the company’s sustainability performance, the tree planting program (NEC3) is located in the second position with a 0.5241 score. The responsibility and climate change systems (NEC2) and Issues concerning climate change (NEC4) come in at the third and fourth positions within the category with scores of 0.48521 and 0.3581, respectively. A responsibility attributed to businesses regarding environmental crisis mitigation is crucial, due to these organizations possessing greater experience than any other group in society when dealing with such kind of problems. The organization should develop an environment towards a climate-friendly perspective, since climate changes are affecting societies and will affect, as a consequence, companies’ revenues. In this scenario, tougher legislation and binding treaties are needed [106].

# Pandemic

Under the Pandemic (PAN) category, results show the sub-attributes in the following order of importance: PAN1>PAN4>PAN2>PAN3. An emergency response plan (PAN1) obtained the highest weight 0.7646. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, whose major consequences are expected to be revealed in the long-term, results provided a deeper analysis of business risks, which can help organizations to plan accordingly. The organizations should incorporate an emergency plan in order to respond to the pandemic (PAN1), which is considered a community-led initiative based on different scenarios for testing the resilience and the plans addressing the several impacts of the crisis.

Following this, the highest sub-criteria identified is the modification in the number of working hours and social distancing (PAN4) with a weight of 0.6752. Environmental dimensions are the focus of companies and, for this research, organizations are taking several actions to fight the coronavirus outbreak, especially with social distancing and the modification in employee working hours. Organizations should also dedicate focus on their supply chains and on social innovations issues that may result from this pandemic. Results also showed that the JIT as well as lean delivery (PAN2) obtained 0.6241 weight and are in the third position within this category. The pandemic caused by the coronavirus emphasized vulnerabilities related to the overreliance of JIT and lean delivery systems. Additionally, there is a concern about whether JIT systems can contribute to the overall efficiency of resources and waste, in order to transform them into environmentally sound [85].

The growing smarter logistics systems are witnessed by organizations, specifically the consideration of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies applications, and reverse logistics for secondary materials and waste products. Some possible applications of IoT and reverse logistics are addressed. In the first example, monitoring where electronics and appliances and their components are may ease their retrieval and allocation at local levels. As a second example, companies may benefit by using intermediary storage/depots instead of using extensive transportation of processed goods, also favoring reverse logistics. The fourth sub-criteria under the COVID-19 pandemic category, commitment to employee safety (PAN3), has a weight of 0.5354.

Investments in renewable energy projects lead to greater engagement by the local community related to renewable energy development. Thus, renewable energy projects can empower the community and enrich their social capital. In addition, an expected outcome is an increase in energy efficiency within a community and reducing energy costs. Organizations can improve sustainability by reducing material waste, energy consumption, and carbon emissions.

# 5. Conclusions

This study’s goal is to propose a corporate sustainability framework that is more resilient than prior models and, to rank relevant criteria to the degree that could help develop a corporate sustainability model. This study is grounded in previous studies and showed the interconnected relations of sustainability and the relevance of considering stakeholders [107]. In meeting the objectives of this study we have multiple contributions to the field of sustainable business practices; (1) to help researchers and practitioners identify essential corporate sustainability criteria as part of a new integrated framework; (2) provide a methodology to help organize and understand a dynamic context for sustainable business practices; (3) extend our understanding of social sustainability by also exploring and finding new insights regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

We were able to identify several sustainability attributes from literature, which allowed for an analysis of prior studies and the identification of sustainability attributes, which is also supported by experts’ assessments. As a result, 45 sustainability sub-criteria were developed and ranked according to the main nine categories of Corporate Governance, Transparency and Communication, Product Responsibility, Environment, Social, Economics, Natural Environment and Climate Change, Energy Consumption and Saving and, for the very first time, we have included Pandemic as an important criterion in the development of corporate sustainability model. These criteria help to develop a new integrative framework of social sustainability. Additional contributions of this study include the application of a Fuzzy Delphi and FAHP methodology, and the computation of nine main criteria and 45 sub-criteria. These criteria provide a more dynamic assessment of the interrelated social dimensions that have in the past been looked at individually and as environmental impacts of firms. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new insights include the Pandemic, along with Economic and Corporate Governance are top-ranked criteria to focus on improving corporate sustainability practices. Whereas, emergency response plan, social distance and modification in the number of working hours, commitment to climate changes, and JIT and lean delivery emerged in the top-ranked sub-criteria.

The outcomes of our work lead us to call for more action from decision-makers and policymakers as sustainability provides an integration opportunity with dynamic social benefits. Moreover, scholars also can consider relevant criteria from literature, and building on this research when combining insights from experts and develop a new, more integrated, corporate sustainability model. The research in this study also contributes to developing theory with contemporary approaches for decision-making analysis to show corporate sustainability theory can and should include more social sustainability practices. When doing so, we hope the efforts of both researchers and practitioners will be able to find more dynamic relationships between practices, firm performance, and resiliency to overcome future pandemics. Our results also provide insights to scholars wanting to further develop theories considering Multiple Management Standards (MMSs), the Stakeholder Theory [108], Integrated Management [109], Integrated Management Systems (IMS), and possibilities for a new theory such as a social sustainability-based view (SBV) of the firm.

The methods used in this study support decision-making in a powerful and relatively simple way. This useful perspective addresses decision-makers and researchers dealing with resource allocation or project prioritization. These methods may be applied toward further replications by future studies. The methods described in this study help in measuring strategic goals as a set of scored criteria for determining project selection. Multi-criterion decision-making methodologies have proven to be useful in the application for manufacturing sectors. We can foresee the need for more work with these types of firms using the application of MCDA in complex interdisciplinary and social sustainability problems. We recommend future studies include developing FAHP techniques in combination with other analysis opportunities in an integrated system, supply chains, cities, and even entire countries aiming to tackle grand challenges, for example, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Finally, this research is the first of its kind considering the development of an integrated social sustainability model with social sustainability criteria that include the pandemic and COVID-19. Outcomes of this study can help organizations to consider the most suitable programs and systems for advancing corporate sustainability while also considering stakeholders and social sustainability. As managerial implications, we see sustainable development enabling companies to integrate audits, engage personnel, and optimizing companies’ processes and resource allocation. Social sustainability is dynamic, not easily understood, and can be disruptive if not taken into account as part of corporate social sustainability at every level of the firm.

This study presents some limitations. We address the limitation related to the developed models based on experts’ assessments. By choosing this approach, it is assumed that bias will always occur in the process. Future applications of this approach may include a diversified set of experts and managers from companies that may be more impacted by systems implementations. Another limitation is concerning data availability. Managers involved in an MCDA process may have limited access to data concerning all criteria or even the entire multinational company as a consequence of a lack of integrated information. Moreover, these issues can be solved by careful consideration of practitioners involved in the decision-making process when realizing that inputs are qualitative, in nature, and the time needed for options assessments. Then, the criteria and outcomes should be revisited when assessing corporate sustainability performance over time.

# ABSTRACT:

The relationship between corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) has long been debated. Ullman (1985) pointed out that the conflicting results could be influenced by many factors, such as sample size, industrial context, inconsistent measurement of CSP and CFP, research methodologies, and procedures for data collection and analysis. This paper addresses Ullman’s (1985) concerns by providing a more methodologically rigorous review of the CSP-CFP relationship than prior research studies. A meta-analysis of 198 studies yields a total sample size of 31,514 observations. The meta-analytic findings suggest that sustainability performance likely increases a firm’s financial performance, especially in the long run. Compared to social sustainability, environmental sustainability, to a larger extent, contributes to the positive CSP-CFP relationship. In addition, CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators. Multi-industry, pre-2000 studies, and non-U.S. sample firms seem to show a stronger impact on the positive relationship between CSP and CFP than other sample indicators. A final finding is that the methodology used in the analysis has a significant impact on the results.

Keywords: meta-analysis; sustainability performance; financial performance; moderators.

# I. INTRODUCTION

In a global economy, competition among companies occurs not only in financial numbers, but also in sustainability development. Sustainability performance and disclosure become increasingly important factors in the competitive success of companies. The term ‘‘sustainability’’ means different things to different stakeholders, because different stakeholders have different concerns. For example, environmentalists may be more concerned with the reduction in air pollution and water usage, and in the recycling of waste. Customers, on the other hand, may have concerns related to product quality and product safety. In this paper, we use the definition from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) that defines ‘‘sustainability’’ as follows:

‘‘Sustainability’’ is a term that has emerged over time from the ‘‘triple bottom-line’’ consideration of (1) economic viability, (2) social responsibility, and (3) environmental responsibility . . . While environmental considerations are often the focus of attention, the triple-bottom-line definition of sustainability is a broad concept. In addition to preservation of the physical environment and stewardship of natural resources, sustainability considers the economic and social context of doing business and also encompasses the business systems, models and behaviors necessary for long-term value creation. (AICPA 2013)

1 The term ‘‘sustainability’’ is often used interchangeably with ‘‘sustainable development,’’ ‘‘corporate social responsibility,’’ ‘‘corporate responsibility,’’ ‘‘corporate citizenship,’’ and ‘‘social enterprise.’’ Although these terms are different, they all point in the same direction: the responsibility of a company toward stakeholders.

There is a large body of literature that has produced conflicting results in explaining the relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. Prior research on the relationship between corporate sustainability performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP) suggests that the current findings are too mixed to draw a generalizable conclusion. Ullman (1985) pointed out that the conflicting results could be attributed to many factors including variations in sample size, and different industrial contexts, inconsistent measurement of CSP and CFP, as well as different research methodologies and procedures for data collection and analysis. Most of the research on the relationship between CSP and CFP has used either market-based or accounting-based measures for financial performance.

To address the issues raised by Ullman (1985), the current study applies meta-analysis procedure to get a better understanding of the factors that affect the relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. Meta-analysis is a statistical method of integrating research results across studies on the same subject (Hunter and Schmidt 2004). It is often used when there are many studies with conflicting empirical results.

Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes (2003) applied meta-analysis to 52 studies and documented that corporate virtue in the form of social responsibility and to a lesser extent, environmental responsibility, is likely to be beneficial to future financial performance. Orlitzky et al. (2003) also found that corporate reputation appears to be an important mediator of the CSP-CFP relationship.

Why is a new meta-analysis necessary? While Orlitzky et al. (2003) looked at the moderating effect of CSR measures, this study extends Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) study by looking at different measures of financial performance as well. Accounting-based measures and market-based measures may account for some of the variance found in the prior literature. The authors also investigate the moderating effect of the short-term versus long-term CSP-CFP relationship. In addition, to address Ullman’s (1985) concern, sample characteristics (for example, sample size, sample period, country, and industry) and analysis methodologies are also examined.

Since Orlitzky et al.’s (2003) meta-analysis was published, sustainability reporting has increased significantly. Most notably, companies are increasing their voluntary sustainability reporting or are required to disclose some of their sustainability performance on their SEC filings (such as form 10-K and 20-F). The United Nations has recommended that all big companies be required to publish corporate sustainability reports by 2030 (United Nations [UN] 2013).

This paper contributes to the current literature of the CSP-CFP relationship in the following ways. The meta-analysis provides a more rigorous review of past research. Traditional literature reviews of the CSP-CFP relationship have relied mostly on narrative reviews. Summaries from narrative literature reviews do not consider sampling and measurement errors and false inferences could be drawn from such reviews. Meta-analysis, however, considers cross-study variation in correlations between CSP and CFP and therefore renders more reliable inferences. These factors include sample size, sample period, measurement methods, industry differences, etc. For example, small sample sizes would show a relatively large sampling error. The focus of this study is not only to test the null hypothesis, but also to tell precisely how large the effect sizes really are. Sample-adjusted correlations were examined to compute the mean effect size and found that the effect size is medium according to Cohen’s (1988) rule of thumb (medium effect if the mean weighted corrected correlation is greater than 0.10 but less or equal to 0.25).

In addition to averaging research results, meta-analysis can also be helpful in finding potential moderators for future research. The moderator variable is used to split the studies into subsets. For each subset, meta-analysis is applied separately. A moderator is present if there are large differences in subset means. By breaking down the whole dataset into subsets to compare the relative magnitudes of correlations arising from different CSP and CFP sample size categories, this paper found the following moderators: accounting-based measures versus market-based measures; U.S. firms versus non-U.S. firms; and environmental versus social studies. Analyzing methods used in individual studies can also affect the results. This study also addresses how different measures of sustainability performance and financial performance affect the CSP-CFP relationship. Meta-analysis suggests that CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators. This study includes 198 effect sizes from 36 articles and yields a total sample size of 31,514 observations. It was found that environmental responsibility contributes to a positive CSP-CFP relationship to a larger extent than social responsibility. In addition, multi-industry, pre-2000 studies, non-U.S. sample firms seem to show a stronger impact on the relationship between CSP and CFP than other sample indicators. The meta-analytic findings suggest a direction for future research.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses related theories, literature review, and hypothesis development; Section III describes dataset development, the coding scheme, and methodology; Section IV presents preliminary.

There are two types of meta-analyses: cumulation of p-values (significance level) and cumulation of the mean effect size (or dr) across studies. In this study, we use the latter procedure to compute mean effect size.

In this chart, the constructs and sub-constructs are indicated by ellipses, i.e., corporate sustainability performance, corporate financial performance, environmental performance, and social performance. Measures are presented by rectangles, i.e., Environ1, Social2, and Financial3, etc. For example, environmental performance measures found in examined studies are chemical emission reduction, waste recycling, the U.S. Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) index, etc.; social performance measures include social responsible ratings (i.e., KLD social ratings or Dow Jones sustainability index), concerns about issues on human rights, gender equality and product quality, accommodation for disabilities, development of heritage conservation, promotion of customer relations, corporate charity giving, and collaboration with social projects, etc. Financial performance uses either accounting-based or market-based measures. Accounting-based measures include financial ratios such as return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), return on sales (ROS), or earnings per share (EPS). Market-based measures include market value, market return, and Tobin’s Q.

# II. THEORY, LITERATURE REVIEW, AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT

This section provides a literature review of studies and theories related to corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. This paper focuses on examining the relationship between performance (CSP) and corporate financial performance (CFP). CSP and CFP are our two main constructs. Using the AICPA’s definition of “sustainability,” environmental performance and social performance were identified as two sub-constructs of CSP. Investors consider these two areas to be most important. For example, 83 percent of investors surveyed in 2010 by Institutional Shareholder Services said they believe environmental and social factors can have a significant impact on shareholder value over the long term (Ernst & Young [E&Y] 2011). About half of the 2011 shareholder proposals in proxy statements have centered on social and environmental issues (E&Y 2011). Figure 1 illustrates the constructs, sub-constructs, and the measurement of each sub-construct. The literature review on the relationship between sustainability performance and financial performance in the paper thus considers the link between environmental performance and financial performance and the link between social performance and financial performance.

In this meta-analysis study, the following common measures are found to be used to measure environmental performance areas, such as chemical emission reduction, waste recycling, the U.S. Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) index, etc. This meta-analysis study also found the following social performance measures used in individual studies, such as social responsible ratings (i.e., KLD social ratings or Dow Jones sustainability index), concerns about issues on human rights, gender equality and product quality, accommodation for disabilities, development of heritage conservation, promotion of customer relations, corporate charity giving, and collaboration with social projects, etc. In the examined studies, financial performance uses either accounting-based or market-based measures. Accounting-based measures include financial ratios such as return on assets.

(ROA), return on equity (ROE), return on sales (ROS), or earnings per share (EPS). Market-based measures include market value, market return, and Tobin’s Q.

# Theories

Ullman (1985) suggests the need for a theory of corporate social performance because of the inconsistent findings that have resulted from studies of the interrelationships among social disclosure, social performance, and economic performance of U.S. companies. Of the theories that have been employed in prior literature, there are two views and three theories that have received much attention from investors. The two views that are related to sustainability performance are the “traditionalist” view and the “revisionist” view. The three theories that are related to sustainability investment and reporting are agency theory, legitimacy theory, and stakeholder theory.

The “traditionalist” view is rooted in neo-classical theory, which posits that pollution abatement measures are predicted to increase production costs and are assumed to have increasing marginal costs (Patten 2002).

The “revisionist” view, also called the Porter hypothesis, was initiated and developed mainly by Porter (Porter and van der Linde 1995) who theorized that pollution reduction provides future cost savings by increasing efficiency, reducing compliance costs, and minimizing future liabilities (King and Lenox 2001), thus increasing firm value. For example, costs incurred to reduce pollution would send a signal to the public that the company cares about the protection of the environment and the quality of life of the community, and thus may increase the positive image of the company. In addition, investment in pollution reduction, whether voluntary or legally imposed, would make a company appear to be a socially responsible company and increase a company’s positive image. A better public image will bring a company positive benefits such as increased sales demands, less input waste in production, and less negative attention from regulators (Konar and Cohen 2001), and therefore increases the company’s financial performance.

The two views and three theories are illustrated in Figure 2.

Agency theory provides a theoretical foundation for the “traditionalist” view. Agency theory as proposed by Jensen and Meckling (1976) states that one of the major functions of managers is to align companies’ interest with shareholders’ interest. Friedman (1970) used agency theory to examine companies’ activity in corporate social responsibility (CSR). Friedman (1970) asserts that engaging in CSR is symptomatic of an agency problem or a conflict between the interest of managers and shareholders. He argues that managers use CSR as a means to pursue their own social, economic, political, and career goals. According to this view, investment in CSR would be more wisely used, from a social perspective, on the improvement to a company’s efficiency. He further argues that every penny used in CSR activities is just spending somebody else’s money and does not do much good for the company as a whole. This theory represents the “traditionalist view.” Under this view, environmental costs used for environmental protection/improvement such as pollution abatement or air emission reduction are predicted to increase production costs and thus lower economic performance. Agency theory has been tested in several studies that examine the CSP and CFP relationship. For example, Wright and Ferris (1997) found that stock prices reacted negatively to announcements of divestment of business units in South Africa, which they interpreted as consistent with agency theory. Studies by Jaggi and Freedman (1992) and King and Lenox (2001) also find a negative relation between environmental performance and economic performance.

Legitimacy theory, originated by Davis (1973), states that “society grants legitimacy and power to business. In the long run, those who do not use power in a manner which society considers responsible will tend to lose it” (Davis 1973, 314). Legitimacy theory posits that organizations are continually seeking to ensure that they operate within the bounds and norms of their respective societies (Deegan and Unerman 2006). Under legitimacy theory, corporations should be socially responsible and accountable to society in order to legally operate their business (Simnett, Vanstraelen, and Chua 2009; Dowling and Pfeffer 1975; Deegan 2002; O’Donovan 2002; de Villiers and van Staden 2006; van Staden and Hooks 2007; Cong and Freedman 2011).

Stakeholder theory, first proposed by Freeman (1984), provides a discussion of the links between external stakeholders and company functions. Freeman (1984) defines stakeholders as “any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization objectives.” The main stakeholders are customers, employees, local communities, suppliers and distributors, the public, regulators, government, policymakers, and shareholders (Friedman and Miles 2006).

Both legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory have developed from the broader political economy perspective (Gray, Owen, and Adams 1996; Deegan 2002; Van der Laan 2009). The two concepts overlap (Gray, Kouhy, and Lavers 1995). They both focus attention on the nexus between the organization and its operating environment (Neu, Warsame, and Pedwell 1998).

While the stakeholder approach is suggested as the best theory to explain managerial behavior, legitimacy theory deals with “perceptions and the processes” involved in the notions of power relationships (Moerman and Van Der Laan 2005).

# Literature Review and Hypothesis Development

# Corporate Sustainability Performance and Corporate Financial Performance

In this section, a brief literature review is provided on the link between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. On one hand, one stream of sustainability studies has examined the association between corporate social performance and corporate financial performance. The empirical results are generally mixed. Some studies found a positive correlation between social performance and economic performance (Bragdon and Marlin 1972; Moskowitz 1972; Sturdivant and Ginter 1977), and some found a negative correlation (Vance 1975; Spicer 1978), and others found no correlation (Alexander and Buchholz 1978). On the other hand, another stream of sustainability studies has focused on the relationship between environmental performance and financial performance. One group of researchers has documented that the high environmental performance of firms increases firms’ financial performance. Another group of researchers has documented that financial performance is negatively associated with environmental performance such as pollution index.

Some research on the link between environmental performance and financial performance argues that there is a conflict between the competitiveness of firms and their environmental performance (Walley and Whitehead 1994). The discussion posits that firms in industries with higher environmental compliance costs face a competitive disadvantage, because compliance costs of production activities outweigh the value added to the firm (for example, Jaggi and Freedman 1992; Blacconiere and).

Patten 1994; Cordeiro and Sarkis 1997; McPeak, Devirian, and Seaman 2010; King and Lenox 2001; Lorraine, Collison, and Power 2004; Murray, Sinclair, Power, and Gray 2006). Other researchers, however, argue that the improved environmental performance is a potential source for competitive advantage as it can lead to more efficient processes, improvements in productivity, lower costs of compliance, and new market opportunities. (Hart and Ahuja 1996; Russo and Fouts 1997; Judge and Douglas 1998; Sroufe 2003; Al-Tuwaijri, Christensen, and Hughes 2004; Clarkson, Li, Richardson, and Vasvari 2008, 2011; Montabon, Sroufe, and Narisimhan 2007; Porter 1991; Porter and van der Linde 1995; Schmidheiny 1992).

A small group of research studies found no relationship between environmental and financial performance. Using the Pearson Correlation method, Yu, Ting, and Wu (2009) examine 51 European companies from 14 industries across 15 countries to investigate the possible relationship, and find there is no correlation. Although it was not able to find a positive association between environmental performance and financial performance, Yu et al. (2009) state that being perceived as a green company may improve a company’s image and reputation, thus attracting more talented workers and green-conscious customers. Wagner (2005) finds a negative (for the emission-based index) and no (for the inputs-based index) relationship between environmental and economic performance.

Due to the mixed results found in prior literature, the hypothesis was therefore developed as a null form.

# Hypothesis:

There is no relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance.

# III. DATASET DEVELOPMENT, CODING SCHEME, AND METHODOLOGY

# Dataset Development

We identified extant empirical research studies focusing on the relationship between sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. In order to locate as many relevant articles as possible from the existing literature, we conducted keyword searches of appropriate electronic databases for both published and unpublished (working) papers. To identify published articles for the meta-analysis dataset, Business Source Complete was used. The Business Source Complete database provides easy access to over 4,000 academic peer-reviewed journals covering all fields of business, in which over 3,000 journals provide full-text articles, and the remaining 1,000 journals offer indexing or abstracts. Since this study focuses only on one relationship—corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance—we used the following words or terms to search published articles in the Business Source Complete database: “sustainability,” “corporate social responsibility,” “corporate responsibility,” “corporate social responsibility performance,” “CSR performance,” “environmental performance,” “social performance,” “environmental disclosure,” “CSR reporting,” “economic performance,” “financial performance,” and “firm value.”

To address the publication bias or the “file-drawer” problem, we also searched for relevant unpublished papers using keyword searches in the Social Science Research Network (SSRN) and Google Scholar. The keywords used in searching for unpublished articles were the same terms used for searching the Business Source Complete database.

After identifying these studies, we evaluated the appropriateness of each one to our research focus to determine whether it was an eligible study to be included in the meta-analysis. To be eligible, a study had to meet three criteria: (1) the study must specifically examine the CSP-CFP relationship, since our paper focuses only on the CSP-CFP relationship; (2) the study must be available online in a full-text format; and (3) the study examining the CSP-CFP relationship must have a correlation (r) or equivalent statistics reported. These r equivalents can be a student t-value (t), p-value (p), beta coefficient (b), or Chi-squared (v2) since the correlation coefficient (r) value is needed when conducting meta-analytical procedures.

Following the searching procedures and inclusion criteria listed above, a total of 36 primary articles were identified as eligible and their published journals included the following: Accounting, Organizations and Society; Academy of Management Review; Journal of Accounting and Economics; Journal of Economics and Business; Business Strategy and the Environment; Accounting, Auditing & Accountability Journal; The Journal of Finance; and etc. Although we would have liked to include published studies from leading accounting journals, our examination of these literature bases revealed theoretical, descriptive, or analytical work on sustainability performance that typically provides no equivalent correlation statistics to make their use possible in our meta-analysis. Additionally, the topics of some articles found in our searches did not address the CSP-CFP relationship, making their inclusion in our meta-analysis inappropriate.4 The identified 36 articles yielded 198 effect sizes and a total of 31,514 observations.

4 For example, we excluded Moser and Martin (2012), O’Dwyer (2009), Evans (2012), Hart (1971) from The Accounting Review due to their being solely theoretical (or descriptive) in nature. Similarly, we had to delete Kim, Myung, and Wier (2012), Dhaliwal, Oliver, Tsang, and Yong (2011), Dhaliwal, Radhakrishnan, Tsang, and Yong (2012), and Chun, Wu, and Zhang (2013) from The Accounting Review due to their non CSP-CFP relationship research. We also removed Ingram (1978) and Ingram and Frazier (1980) from Journal of Accounting Research, and Murphy (1985) from Journal of Accounting and Economics. Another two articles by O’Dwyer (2011) and Dillard (2011) from Contemporary Accounting Research were also excluded from our meta-analysis.

# Which Factors Moderate Relationship between Sustainability and Financial Performances?

The effect size used in our meta-analysis is the point biserial correlation coefficient. It is an appropriate metric for our research because it is a commonly reported statistics metric in the existing studies. More importantly, it provides easy interpretation and meaningful comparison across studies with different sample sizes (Hunter and Schmidt 2004). Generally, two types of effect size measures are often seen: the sizes of associations or the sizes of differences. The correlation/regression coefficient r is most commonly known because r value ranges from -1 to +1, covering no relationship (i.e., r = 0) to a perfect relationship (i.e., r = 1 or -1). A correlation between two groups may have occurred by chance. The likelihood that an effect, such as a correlation seen in the data, may be assessed by p-value—the probability that a null is correct. This probability can be affected by the size of effect and the size of the sample. Specifically, the probability goes up (or down) as the size of the effect goes down (or up) and as the size of the sample goes down (or up). Thus, estimation of p-value alone can cause problems in interpreting a single relationship. In our study, our focus is not only to test the null hypothesis but also to tell precisely how large the effects really are. That is why we calculated effect sizes in our overall effect analysis and univariate analysis. We used Cohen’s rules of thumb as a guide for interpreting these effect sizes, since Cohen was quite influential in the area of effect sizes. Cohen suggested that an r of |0.10| be considered a “small” effect size, |0.25| a “medium” effect size, and |0.40| a “large” effect size (Cohen 1988). According to Cohen’s terminology, a “small” effect size is one in which there is a real effect, but which you can only see through careful study. A “large” effect size is an effect that is big enough and/or consistent enough to be able to see it in our naked eye.

# Coding Scheme

To be included in the meta-analysis, the correlation coefficient (r) and sample size must be collected. The standardized mean difference effect sizes (d) and the correlation coefficients (r) can be derived from summary statistics, such as t-test, F-test and χ², etc. This information is useful in the coding process. To perform a meta-analysis, all variables are coded either 1 or 0. Variables are categorized into four main categories: general, measures-related, sample-related, and methodology-related. Within each main category, additional information on different variables is collected. The following table shows the variables used in the meta-analysis. Descriptions of variables are given in Table 1.

# Methodology Used in This Study

# Meta-Analytic Procedures

We employed analytic techniques prescribed by Hunter and Schmidt (2004) in our data analysis. For the main effect of corporate sustainability performance, we calculated the weighted correlation (r W) between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance measures. This overall correlation weighted each eligible study by sample size and then averaged across all studies to ensure that sampling error is accounted for in the estimation. Then the average study variance (var) was computed and the heterogeneity (Chi-squared or χ²) was estimated. A statistically significant χ² suggests the existence of moderating factors in explaining the variation in the effect of CSP on CFP. In order to interpret the significance of the correlation between CSP and CFP, we further computed the 95 percent bootstrapped confidence interval (CI BS). The merit of using the 95 percent bootstrapped confidence interval is that it provides a more powerful estimate than the traditional confidence interval because it does not require an assumption of normal distribution of data. Finally, the fail-safe sample size (NfsR) was calculated to assess the possibility of publication bias or the “file-drawer” problem. A higher value of NfsR suggests more robust and reliable results obtained.

# Moderator Analysis Procedures

If the overall effect results of meta-analysis suggest the presence (a significantly high Chi-squared) of moderators, then to further examine and understand the role of moderators in the CSP-CFP relationship, we performed a weighted generalized least squares regression (GLS). Following the prior meta-analytic approach (Raudenbush, Becker, and Kalaian 1988), we used the following equations to estimate the moderating effects:

b = (X'R⁻¹X)⁻¹X'R⁻¹d

d = Xb + e

Vb = (X'R⁻¹X)⁻¹

where d is the transformed correlation associated with corporate sustainability effect coded from the dataset; X is the matrix of

# IV. RESULTS

# Main Effects

This section provides the meta-analytic results for the overall sustainability performance effects. Table 2 presents the overall results of the main effects associated with sustainability performance.

We used MetaWin computer software to perform meta-analysis because MetaWin offers the distinctive features of an effect size calculator, and more conservative results as well as the graphical presentation. According to Hunter and Schmidt (2004), there are several commercial programs available for different types of meta-analysis: D-stat (Johnson 1989), Advance BASIC Meta-Analysis (Mullen 1989), and MetaWin (Rosenberg, Adams, and Gurevitch 1997). The first two programs are limited to fixed-effects meta-analysis models, while MetaWin allows for both fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis models. Bax, Yu, Ikeda, and Moons (2007) studied four commercial meta-analysis programs (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA), WEasyMA, MetaWin, and MetAnalysis) and two free programs (RevMan and MIX) and found that MetaWin’s results are slightly more conservative, since the confidence intervals are based on bootstraps.

* p &lt; 0.05.

Our hypothesis predicts there is no relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. The meta-analysis in Table 2 shows that the correlation between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance is 0.1737 (The uncorrected correlation is 0.1699.) As such, the effect is medium-sized (Cohen 1988). This suggests that the level of financial performance is significantly associated with the level of sustainability performance. The 95 percent bootstrapped confidence interval around the mean correlation ranges from 0.1468 to 0.2024, indicating the effect size is significant (because 0 is not in this range). Rosenthal’s (1979) fail-safe N(NfsR = 57,637) suggests that publication bias (the file-drawer problem) is not a problem. An additional 57,637 studies would need to be added to the meta-analysis in order to yield a statistically nonsignificant overall effect. Given the heterogeneity present within the dataset (v2 (198) = 837.2772, p &lt; 0.01), an examination of key moderators to the relationship between sustainability performance and financial performance is warranted. The moderator analysis will be discussed after the main effect results are presented.

# Moderator Results (Full Sample)

In addition to integrating the results across studies, meta-analytic procedures can help find factors that moderate the relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. In this section, the whole dataset is split into several pairs of subsets. Then the generalized least squares (GLS) analysis for the moderator effects was performed. Before running GLS, outliers were examined by calculating Huffcutt and Arthur’s (1995) sample-adjusted meta-analytic deviancy (SAMD) statistic. The final dataset for moderator analysis includes 198 effect sizes. Table 3 presents an overview of the GLS results. The results show that in addition to the positive correlation observed in prior research between sustainability performance and financial performance, other moderators also contribute to the CSP-CFP relationship. These moderator variables are listed in Table 3.

As shown in Table 3, variable measurement issues (for example, environmental versus social issues; accounting-based versus market-based; the short-term versus long-term impact of sustainability engagement), samples used (for example, multi-industry versus single industry; U.S. firms versus non-U.S. firms), as well as statistical methodologies employed (simple versus complex) have important moderating effects on the link between sustainability performance and financial performance. A simple method refers to a correlation coefficient, regression, or survey method; and a complex method refers to a two-stage least squares or three-stage least squares regression method employed in the examined studies. To further understand the nature (including the magnitude and direction) of the moderator effects, a univariate analysis was conducted on each moderator that was found to be significant in the GLS analysis. The procedure for univariate analysis is similar to the overall analysis except that no test is needed for the fail-safe (NfsR). The overall results are reported in Table 4.

Depending on the nature of the impact, the results were reported from post hoc analyses in three categories: measurement-related moderator effect, sample-related moderator effect, and methodology-related moderator effect. In the next section, results of the GLS analyses for each moderator examined were reported, as well as significant findings from the post hoc univariate analyses.

# Measurement-Related Moderators of Corporate Sustainability Performance Effects on Corporate Financial Performance

In the dataset, different measures of the dependent variable (financial performance) and independent variable (sustainability performance) play significant moderating effects on the financial-sustainability relationship. For sustainability performance measures, results in Table 3 indicate that studies where the sustainability issue is related to the environment are significantly different from those studies where the examined studies are related to social issues (b = -2.5451, p &lt; 0.01). Post hoc analyses in Table 4 reveal that the correlation between sustainability performance and financial performance is significantly greater when the examined issue is environmental-related (r = 0.2035, p &lt; 0.01) than where the issue is social related (r = ...

# Variable Definitions:

- Corporate Sustainability Performance (CSP) = 1 if environmental issues and 0 if social issues are addressed in the article;
- Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) = 1 if financial performance (CFP) is measured using accounting numbers or ratios, and 0 if market-based measures;
- Long-Term Effect = 1 if short-term, and 0 if long-term effect of corporate sustainability performance on corporate financial performance is examined in an individual study;
- Sample Period = 1 if sample period studied is after year 2000 (post-2000), and 0 if before 2000 (pre-2000);
- Industry = 1 if sample firms are from multiple industries, and 0 if from a single industry;
- Country = 1 if sample firms are U.S. firms, and 0 if non-U.S. firms;
- Methodology = 1 if a complex method (such as two-stage least squares or three-stage least squares regression method) is used, and 0 if a simple method (such as correlation coefficient, regression, or survey method) is used in the prior studies.

For financial performance measures, results in Table 3 indicate that sustainability performance effects vary significantly depending on whether the financial performance is using an accounting-based measure or market-based measure (b = 5.5254, p < 0.01). Studies that use accounting-based measures (for example, accounting ratios such as return on assets, return on equity, or return on sales) to proxy for financial performance find a stronger positive impact on the CSP-CFP relationship than studies that use market-based measures (for example, stock price or market return). Results in Table 4 indicate that sustainability performance effects are stronger in studies where accounting-based measures (r = 0.1929, p < 0.01) are used as compared to those where the market-based measures are used (r = 0.1520).

Results in Table 3 also suggest a significant difference between long-term and short-term effects of sustainability performance on financial performance (b = 13.9943, p < 0.01). Further analysis in Table 4 suggests that sustainability performance effects are stronger in the studies where the impact is examined in the long run (r = 0.2143, p < 0.01), as compared to those where the impact is examined in the short run (r = 0.1576). Sustainability performance has a stronger impact on financial performance when the examined relationship is long-term compared to short-term.

# Sample-Related Moderators of Corporate Sustainability Performance Effects on Financial Performance

The mixed results observed in previous studies in our dataset can also be explained by differences in the sample firms used in the studies. The effects of sustainability performance are significantly different for studies whose samples are composed of multiple industries versus a single industry (b = 9.7899, p < 0.01). Multi-industry samples present a stronger impact on the financial-sustainability performance (r = 0.1837, p < 0.01) than a single industry (r = 0.1339).

The effects of sustainability performance are also significantly different for studies that examine U.S. firms versus non-U.S. firms (b = 2.8029, p < 0.01). Non-U.S. sample firms (r = 0.1862, p < 0.15) show a stronger impact on the CSP-CFP relationship than the U.S. sample firms (r = 0.1662).

The time when the sustainability performance is examined is also a significant moderator. There is a significant variation of sustainability performance effects according to whether or not the study was pre- or post-2000 (b = 19.0246, p < 0.01).

A stronger correlation between sustainability performance and financial performance is observed in post-2000 studies versus pre-2000 studies (r = 0.2023 versus r = 0.1009, p < 0.01).

# Methodology-Related Moderators of Corporate Sustainability Performance Effects on Corporate Financial Performance

The methodology used in the analysis appeared to be a significant moderator of the financial-sustainability relationship. Results in Table 3 indicate that studies where complex methods (for example, two-stage least squares, or three-stage least squares regression method) are employed are significantly different from other simple methods (studies using regression, correlation coefficient, survey) (b = 16.5990, p < 0.01). Post hoc analyses in Table 4 reveal that the correlation between sustainability performance and financial performance is significantly weaker when complex methods are used (r = 0.1480, p < 0.01), as compared to those using simple methods (r = 0.1863).

# Moderator Results (Subsample)

The previous subsection “Moderator Results (Full Sample)” reports the main moderator effect for the full sample consisting of 198 effect sizes. The results shown in Table 4 indicate that a positive correlation between CSP and CFP is more likely when the accounting-based measures of CFP or when simple methods are used. This section investigates the significance and magnitude of individual moderators found in Table 4 using a subsample related to measurement and methodology issues. Procedures used in Table 3 and 4 were repeated to explore the moderating effect of individual accounting-based measures versus market-based measures and the moderating effect of simple versus complex methodologies used in the prior research. Table 5 shows the results of the moderator analysis and Table 6 presents the breakdown univariate results of these moderator effects using subsamples.

Results in Table 5 and Table 6 reveal that compared to the return on assets (ROA) measure, other accounting measures such as return on equity (ROE), return on sales (ROS), and earnings per share (EPS) or sales growth appear to have a stronger impact on the CSP-CFP relationship (significant at 1 percent level). In contrast, for market-based measures, share price and market return appear to have a stronger impact on the CSP-CFP relationship than Tobin’s Q measure (significant at 5 percent level). Table 5 also reveals that the methodology employed in the previous studies is significant in the CSP-CFP relationship.

# Which Factors Moderate Relationship between Sustainability and Financial Performances?

# V. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH

The correlation coefficient method is more likely to be observed in a positive CSP-CFP relationship than the other two simple methods (for example, regression or survey).

Using meta-analysis, this study examines the relationship between corporate sustainability performance and corporate financial performance. Recall that the hypothesis predicts that there is no relationship between CSP and CFP. The overall meta-analytic results suggest that corporate sustainability performance has a positive impact on corporate financial performance, especially in the long term. This implies that in the long run, market forces reward companies that are high in corporate sustainability performance. This may motivate managers to pursue CSP even though the company may not be profitable in the short run. In addition, the moderator effects analysis using the generalized least squares (GLS) method and meta-analytic procedures show that: (1) compared to social responsibility, environmental responsibility, to a larger extent, contributes to the positive CSP-CFP relationship, inconsistent with the findings of Orlitzky et al. (2003). Environmental issues, such as climate change, have gained a lot of attention not only from large companies, but also from medium and small enterprises. By engaging in environmental improvement, firms improve their relationship with regulators, stakeholders, and the general public. (2) CSP appears to be more highly correlated with accounting-based measures of CFP than with market-based indicators. Future research may be needed to explain why accounting-based measures are preferred. (3) The study also finds sample characteristics play a significant moderating role in the CSP-CFP relationship. Multi-industry firms, pre-2000 sustainability studies, and non-U.S. firms appeared to have a stronger impact on the positive relationship than other sample indicators. (4) The methodology used in the prior studies also matters. The simple methods (such as correlation coefficient, regression, and survey) appear to have a stronger impact on the relationship between CSP and CFP compared to complex methods (such as two-stage least squares and three-stage least squares).

This study can be extended to other sustainability-related areas. For example, sustainability disclosure and corporate governance may be examined to investigate their impacts on the sustainability performance.

In conclusion, this study contributes to the current corporate sustainability literature by providing an in-depth investigation of different measures used for CSP and CFP, closely examining sample characteristics, and comparing different methodologies used in prior literature by using meta-analysis.
