# Abstract

The rise of the Sustainable Development (SD) concept contributed to the increasing interest in practices encompassing the Sustainable Human Resource Management (Sustainable HRM) and the results of these practices. This article relates to the area of Human Resource Management and activities undertaken by HR departments to implement the principles of sustainable development in the enterprise. In particular, it refers to the concept of Sustainable HRM, recognized by many researchers as a new paradigm in the area of HRM. Although an intensely-studied subject, there is a clear gap in research regarding Sustainable HRM in Polish companies. Additionally, there is a lack of research contribution on the Podlasie region—ecologically and ethnically the most diverse region in the country. While sustainability in environmental terms is evident in the region, the article focuses on sustainability implementation in the business sector. The article helps to close the research gap. Its aim is to examine the two-fold role of HR departments in: Implementing activities in the area of Sustainable HRM, and introducing the principles of sustainability to corporate strategies. It was assumed that such activities contribute to corporate sustainability. In order to verify the role of HR departments, a new, comprehensive research model, based on the work of De Prins, was built. The model relates to the double-task of HR departments in organizations. The added value of the article stems from the research model proposal, which can be applied without geographical limitations and to numerous organization types. The paper introduces one of the applications of the model—a regional one. The model was tested in a questionnaire survey conducted among employees of enterprises operating in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, which is unique in terms of environment, culture, and economy in Poland. The respondents were participants of MBA studies at one of the universities of the Podlaskie Voivodeship. The results of the study fully confirmed the hypothesis adopted in the study regarding the performance of activities by HR departments in the psychological and social areas of Sustainable HRM. The third aspect of the study, regarding the ecological area, was not clearly confirmed in the study. It was found that this may result from the restrictive law regulating the issue of the impact of enterprises on the natural environment. The results of the study allowed for the verification of the main hypothesis assumed in the research model, thus confirming its truthfulness.

# 1. Introduction

The aim of the article is to highlight the role of Human Resource Management (HRM) on the path to a sustainable organization. Stahl, Brewster, Colling, and Hajro [1] point to two different approaches to the HRM–CS (Corporate Sustainability) relation. One of these approaches is based on the assumption

Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987; doi:10.3390/su12218987 www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability

Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

that HR acts as a driver for CS. The other assumes that CS is seen as an enabler of sustainable HRM. This article is based on the assumption that the relation between CS and HRM is mutual, complex, and interactive. The article is theoretical and empirical in nature. It was created on the basis of a literature review on Sustainable HRM and Corporate Sustainability, as well as research conducted among employees of HR departments of companies operating in the region of north-eastern Poland.

In HRM literature, it is common to find that most HRM practices are shaped by strategic and economic aspirations of organizations to maximize profit [2,3]. This concept, which supports the managerial view of HRM practices and primarily aims at improving the economic performance of the company, is assumed to be the mainstream view of HRM [2, 3]. While corporations need to be profitable in order to ensure their existence; they cannot be interested in profits only when trying to reach Corporate Sustainability [4]. Organizations should be managed in the interest of more stakeholders than just the shareholder’s [5–9]. Sustainable HRM, by relating to multiple stakeholders, seems to bring the people and respect for humanity back to human resource management [10] and widen the future HR perspective by including both internal and external stakeholders as well as more employee-oriented thinking [11, 12]. Business should be conscientious not to exploit the most important asset of the company for the sole purpose of profit [13] (p. 132).

# 1.1. Corporate Sustainability

The concept of CS is related to the broader concept of sustainable development, which has been defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” [14] (p. 43). Therefore, sustainability transported to the business level is referred to as Corporate Sustainability [15].

In reference to the concept of sustainable development (SD), Corporate Sustainability can be defined as meeting the needs of a firm’s direct and indirect stakeholders without compromising its ability to meet the needs of future stakeholders as well [15]. At the organizational level, this concept of SD has been translated to CS, which “entails the preservation, regeneration, and development of the ecological, economic and social resources of a system” [16] (p. 84). As such, CS can be considered as the process of organizational change, i.e., sustainability driven change. The purpose of this change is to move the organization to the state in which equally distributed attention to economic, social, and environmental concerns is incorporated into its strategy. Ultimately, sustainability-driven change has the purpose of transforming an organization into an active agent for sustainable development [17]. Subject literature has recognized the central role of facilitating and supporting such change played by the HRM system. Therefore, companies engaging in the development of their CS at some point also invest in the development of a more Sustainable HRM.

There is a number of reasons why CS is closely related to Human Resource Management. HR could guide the organization’s leaders in the incorporation of sustainability in its strategy and help the realization of Corporate Sustainability-goals [18–20]. Sustainable HRM is seen as ‘the’ opportunity for HR to prove its own legitimacy and strategic position. Ehnert [19] regards sustainability as having a strategic potential for HRM.

# 1.2. Sustainable Management of Human Resources

Human Resource Management is an area which witnesses a constant evolution and change. The rationale behind relating the concept of human resource management with environmental issues is that it leads to sustainability and has become a new paradigm in this field [21]. Moreover, the organization’s department of human resources plays a significant role in creating a culture of sustainable development for the enterprises [22].

The concept of Sustainable HRM is the result of linking the concept of sustainable development with human resource management in an organization.

Sustainable HRM entails taking into account the economic as well as the social and ecological aspects of company objectives while implementing the human resource function. It is believed that

“HRM is the best placed to provide leadership and drive innovation to influence individuals, groups, and all organizational actors toward embracing more sustainable attitudes and behaviors” [23] (p. 813). According to Ehnert and Harry “HRM could play a vital role in implementing a sustainability mindset in business organizations” [24] (p. 236). This turns out to be a “survival strategy” for organizations dependent on high quality employees. Therefore, it is logical for organizations to apply Sustainable HRM, as it allows them to take care of what the companies should sustain. Additionally, Sustainable HRM allows for implementing a manner in which it will do so without compromising the needs of future generations of the company employees [13] (p. 136).

According to I. Ehnert [19] sustainable management of human resources means undertaking such activities that enable achieving the organization’s goals in the long term and demonstrate care for the employees at the same time. R. Kramar extends this definition by adding the element of minimizing the negative impact of the company’s activities on the natural environment, employees, and the community [25]. The author emphasizes the role of all employees of the organization in this process.

In Poland, the definition of Sustainable HRM was presented by A. Pabian, who claims “the essence of this concept is planning and recruiting employees and affecting them in such a way that they achieve economic, ecological and social goals in the enterprise, thus contributing to balancing inter-generational needs” [26] (pp. 8–9).

Until recently, it was considered that Sustainable HRM as a concept was still undefined and has not yet received much attention from scholars [27–31]. Despite the increasingly important role management plays, “the history of research on Sustainable HRM is still at the pioneering if not emerging phase. It is only in the past decade that we observe an increase in publications on sustainability and HRM (...)” [24] (p. 225). However, in recent years there has been an increased interest in Sustainable HRM. The evidence of scholarly and academic interest in Corporate Sustainability and Human Resource Management are: The edited volume by Ehnert et al., together with the special issues in journals such as Human Resource Management 51 (6), Personnel Psychology 67 (4), Journal of Organizational Behavior 34 (2), Organization 20 (3), and Management Review 23 (3), have devoted attention to Corporate Sustainability and HRM [17].

The issues raised in the research on Sustainable HRM focus on the question of whether the concept of sustainable human resource management is important in achieving sustainable development of an enterprise [32] (p. 91). The results of this study have shown that enterprises in the West Pomeranian Province, Poland, actually use the concept of the sustainable management of human resources in business management to achieve sustainable development.

Other issues undertaken in the research concern the implementation of Sustainable HRM in a SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) context in Lithuania. The results of the research (case study) showed that despite the fact that the company’s owner tried to implement some Sustainable HRM practices that were mainly related to work-life balance and health management issues, these practices were not sufficient and did not solve crucial problems such as job burnouts, lack of expertise, retention of employees, limited career development, and weak leadership, which are the issues that many authors distinguish as challenges that stop SMEs from achieving a better performance in the long run [33].

Noteworthy at this point is also a study conducted in Finnish companies on how Finnish top managers actually construct the meaning of Sustainable HRM. According to the results of the research, Sustainable HRM is organized into four (interconnected) main dimensions: Justice and equality, transparent HR practices, profitability, and employee well-being. The analysis also reveals how these dimensions are linked to different stakeholder groups. Thus, Sustainable HRM seems to bring the people and respect for humanity back to the human resource management and widen the future HR perspective to include both internal and external stakeholders. It also embraces more employee-oriented thinking in organizations, turning the leadership in a more responsible direction [34].

# Results of the literature review

Results of the literature review indicate that Sustainable Human Resource Management plays a significant and positive role in achieving organizational outcomes. Moreover, via the strength of the HRM system, it exerts an additional impact upon employees and external stakeholders [35].

Sustainable HRM practices enhance profit maximization for the organization and at the same time reduce the negative harmful influence on employees, their families, and communities [36]. The beneficial role of Sustainable HRM varies therefore with regards to the organization, the employees, and the society.

The positive influence Sustainable HRM has on the organization can be observed in the growth of the overall value of the organization’s worth [37–40], as well as in the increase of national and international competitiveness [41]. Those improved results can be attributed to the impact Sustainable HRM has on the employees. It can be observed that Sustainable HRM leads to improved employee engagement [42], increased employee satisfaction, and therefore higher organizational loyalty [43], HR quality boost [44], motivation growth [40, 44], employee development, and enhanced work efficiency [40].

Sustainable HRM is beneficial for the organization and for the employees, but it also positively affects other stakeholder groups. The general effect Sustainable HRM has on the society as a whole can be characterized as a contribution to the activities of the societies. Sustainable HRM incorporates activities directed towards improving communities and neighbourhoods. Additionally, it allows creating sustainable career pathways for the younger generations to become transitional on the job market and secure a better future [45].

Sustainable HRM is at times considered a new humanistic paradigm in management, which, although sometimes recognized as an alternative to the economic one, does not separate itself from the necessity of generating profit by an enterprise [5,21,32].

The direct effect of implementing the concept of Sustainable HRM is shaping sustainable human resources, i.e., highly qualified employees who understand and apply the principles of sustainable development in their work. This concept includes both: Managers setting directions at all levels of the company, as well as employees employed in non-managerial positions [20,46].

# Functions of Sustainable Human Resource Management

Sustainable Human Resource Management is assigned numerous functions in an organization. E. Cohen, S. Taylor, and M. Muller-Camen [47] claim that it:

- Supports the organization’s sustainable development strategy;
- Emphasizes fair treatment, development, and the well-being of employees;
- Contributes to building the skills, value, and trust of employees and increases their engagement in sustainable development;
- Focuses on the well-being of the internal (employees) and external (all entities interested in the functioning of the organization) stakeholders;
- Supports environmentally-friendly organizational practices.

# 1.3. Sustainable Management Research Model

One of the first attempts to capture the complexity of the concept of Sustainable Human Resource Management is the holistic model by Peggy De Prins. According to De Prins [19], Sustainable HRM focuses on the optimal use and respect of human capital in the organization in which the clear relationship between the organization’s strategic policies and the environment in which it operates is built. The model assumes four aspects of Sustainable HRM [48] (pp. 15–17): Sociological, psychological, ecological, and strategic. On the basis of the De Prins model and the Sustainable HRM aspects included in it, a research model was built that indicates the double role of HR departments, consisting in carrying out activities in the area of the three mentioned aspects and introducing them into the company’s strategy. This model is the basis in the study.

The Sustainable HRM framework, including all of those aspects, is depicted in the figure below and developed next.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

The psychological perspective focuses on the employee and, in particular, on what one deems important. If assumed that people play a key role in creating a lasting competitive advantage, then the knowledge about and promoting of what motivates them to work should be of significant importance for the organization [18]. An important role in this aspect of Sustainable HRM is played by: Work–life balance, autonomy, self-development, and a balanced career. An example of the latter will be used to study the psychological aspect of Sustainable HRM. A balanced career is different from the traditional career path, as 20th century enterprises mostly applied the economic paradigm in management.

The new career model, based on the idea of careers as actions, as means of learning, and as boundary-less entities, has replaced the prior model of careers as structures, as means of earning, and as constrained entities. This new concept of career has gained the name of a balanced career. Its source lies in the more commonly used concept of human sustainability.

An exemplary definition was provided by Carl Holling, who defined human sustainability as: “the capacity to create, test and maintain adaptive capability” [49] (p. 390). Holling’s definition is related to the operationalization of the concept of employability by Van der Heijde and Van der Heijden and reads: “The capacity of continuously fulfilling, acquiring or creating of work through the optimal use of competences” [50] (p. 453). The latter suggests an important responsibility of the individual employee in creating, testing, and maintaining his or her own work capacity or ability. On a similar note, Oldham and Hackman [51] stressed the increasing importance of personal initiative of workers to successfully progress or adjust one’s work capacity or ability across time by shaping or customizing their jobs in order to protect their sustainability at work (for example, via job crafting) [52].

In the view of the above, the concept of sustainable careers could be perceived as ‘sequences of job opportunities that go beyond the boundaries of single employment settings’ [53].

The sociological approach aims to make HRM activities more of a social practice. The interests and commitment of the three elements—the employee, the employer, and the society—are closely related in this perspective. Issues such as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) or social issues such as employee diversity, age, gender, nationality or ethnicity, disability, etc. are of great importance in this approach.

Socially responsible human resource management manifests itself in the treatment of employees as important stakeholders of the enterprise [54]. Diversity management will be used to study the social aspect of Sustainable HRM.

Diversity is often defined as any significant difference that distinguishes one individual from another—a description that encompasses a broad range of overt and hidden qualities. Researchers classify diversity characteristics into four areas:

- Personality (traits, skills and abilities),
- internal (gender, race, ethnicity, IQ, sexual orientation),
- external (culture, nationality, religion, marital or parental status), and
- organizational (position, department, union/non-union) [54].

Organizational policies formulated to manage diversity aim to implement initiatives, activities, and practices that recognize, promote, or encourage the differences between groups or people. These elements are seen as positive values that warrant development to achieve social integration, which can also boost productivity of the company and support the democratization of access to opportunities [55].

Diversity means the dissimilarity, variety, and individuality that emerges from various differences between people. Diversity of individual abilities, experiences, competencies, and qualifications of human resources contributes to the success factor in organizations, which enables entrepreneurial strategies of increasing flexibility and continuous learning. Managing Diversity is more than a scheme. It is an attitude and a new understanding of how enterprises function and how to manage human resources in a sustainable way. Creating and applying effective diversity management concepts is one of the main challenges in modern organizations [56].

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

Human resource management involves planning, integration, and actions to achieve effective management of all employees. Diversity can be included in the set of human management practices, guaranteeing an alignment between the strategies of human resources and diversity management goals.

The ecological perspective concerns those aspects of HRM that can help make an organization “greener” (environmentally-friendly). This includes activities such as employee training in sustainable development or stimulation of pro-environmental behaviours that create employee competences. The wide spectrum of the definition of “green” HRM is shown in Table 1.

Employees, employers, customers, and regulatory stakeholders can be stimulants of green HRM. The literature also indicates three strategies used by employers to stimulate green behaviour [61]. They are as follows:

1. Mobilizing employees to implement sustainability in basic operations and at every stage and level of their business;
2. Holding employees accountable for applying sustainable practices in their work and encouraging them to further such practices in pay incentives;
3. Equipping employees with tools and training them to develop for further improvements.

The authors focusing on the issue of “green” HRM point to a number of ecological practices that can be applied in the area of human resource management at all individual stages of the human resource process [62] as:

- Including tasks related to environmental protection in job descriptions,
- Taking into account green competences as a component of the requirements profile at each workplace,
- Preference in the recruitment and selection process of candidates with competences and experience in implementing ecological projects,
- Encouraging the development of “green” competences and offering environmental training for employees and managers,
- Inclusion of ecological criteria in the periodic assessment of employees,
- Sharing knowledge in relation to environmental initiatives and programs and rewarding for their implementation, and
- Encouraging ecological behaviour during the performance of professional tasks (i.e., limiting the use of paper in the office, waste segregation).

An element of green HRM is also creating a green workplace called “green collars”. These are positions that help reduce the negative impact on the natural environment by improving the ecological quality of products, services, and technological processes [61].

Green HR practices should be implemented in a precisely planned HR strategy as part of the overall strategy concept. It is also important to study the company’s strategy and culture, because they determine the effectiveness and efficiency of green HRM.

The strategic perspective of Sustainable HRM explores the links between sustainable and strategic HRM. This approach highlights the impact that sustainable HRM has on traditional HR spheres, such

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

as recruitment and selection, employee rotation, aspects of evaluation, and employment opportunities within the organization. The task of HR is to achieve organizational goals that not only bring monetary benefits [19]. The main assumptions of this approach are the belief that people create a lasting competitive advantage and that achieving it enables sustainable management of human resources. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that related policies are still under review and analysis.

The Human Resource Planning Society defines five key knowledge areas for HR practitioners [22]:

- HR strategy and planning,
- leadership development,
- talent management,
- organizational effectiveness, and
- building a strategic HR function.

Losey et al. [63] described numerous opportunities in the realm of sustainability for HR to bring important operational competencies and to exert strategic leadership.

The model presented in Figure 1 will be verified in an empirical study relating to enterprises in Podlasie. To this end, the main hypothesis was formulated and adopted. It reads as follows: In enterprises operating in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, there is a relationship between the use of sustainable development practices by HR departments and their introduction to the company’s development strategy. The main hypothesis will be verified in a following empirical study.

# 2. Materials and Methods

# 2.1. Research Area and Research Population

The location of the research and selection of the research sample is purposeful, as the Podlaskie Voivodeship, located in the north-eastern part of Poland, is unique in the scale of the country in the perspective of natural, social, and economic scale. Its character is determined by areas of natural value. The legally protected areas with special natural values are built of the total area of national parks, nature reserves, landscape parks, protected landscape areas, documentation stands, ecological lands, and nature and landscape complexes. Taking into account the entire area of NATURA 2000, at least 40% of the area of the Podlaskie Voivodeship is covered by some form of nature protection. Those are unique places, on a European scale, barely changed by human activity.

Podlaskie Voivodeship, compared to other regions in Poland, is the least industrialized. Its share in domestic industrial production is only about 1.7%.

The main sectors of the economy of the Podlaskie Voivodeship are also closely related to the specificity of the region, which is characterized by high air quality and rich natural resources, used.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

# 2.1. Economic Sectors of the Podlaskie Voivodeship

The main sectors of the economy of the Podlaskie Voivodeship are also closely related to the specificity of the region, which is characterized by high air quality and rich natural resources, used in a sustainable way. Branches of the Podlaskie Voivodeship, in which the region has above average potential, include [64]:

- Agri-food sector and sectors connected with it by the value chain,
- metal and machine industry, boatbuilding, and sectors related to it by the value chain,
- medical sector and life sciences and sectors related to it by the value chain, and
- eco-innovation, environmental sciences, and sectors related to it by the value chain (including renewable energy sources, resource-efficient construction, and efficient wood processing).

The Podlasie region is also unique in terms of culture and religions. For centuries, Podlasie served as both a political and national border, where the Polish, Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian ethnos intertwined. Companies in the Podlaskie Voivodeship operate in a religious plurality which stems from the area’s location and history. Its multinational character provided a solid background for the creation of distinct systems of values and attitudes [65]. Podlasie is one of the most religiously diverse regions in Poland. The Catholic and Orthodox congregations constitute 77% and 13.5% of all inhabitants of Podlaskie Voivodeship, respectively (in some districts, for example in the Hajnowski district, over 80% of the inhabitants are Orthodox Church believers) [65].

The research was conducted on a group of 73 participants of MBA studies at the Janski University in Łomża, one of the three centres of economic life in the region. The research included students of two editions of the studies—2019 and 2020. The study group is dominated by men (66%) and people with over 10 years of work experience (53%). All participants acquired higher education, which is a formal requirement for candidates for MBA studies.

# 2.2. Research Tool

The technique of a survey was used. The research tool was constructed on the basis of a questionnaire used on Dutch company managers with regards to the application of sustainable human resource management [39]. It consists of a record and 24 statements relating to four aspects of sustainable human resource management (6 for each aspect): Social, psychological, environmental, and strategic.

The type and intensity of activities related to diversity management (social aspect) were identified on the basis of six statements concerning undertaking activities for older workers (1), various age groups (2), people with disabilities (3), various cultural groups (4), religious groups (5), and women (6).

The psychological aspect (the possibility for an employee to pursue a sustainable professional career) was diagnosed on the basis of 6 statements claiming that: Employees are treated as a key resource of the organization (1), they are provided with a job consistent with their interests and talents (2), coaching (3) and professional development (4) are available, the company covers the costs of training (5), and monitors the progress in employee behaviour towards sustainable development (6).

Inclusion of ecological issues in human resource management by enterprises was diagnosed on the basis of the assessment of statements concerning: The company’s taking into account the pro-ecological attitudes of job candidates (1) and during employee assessment (2), using public transport by employees (3) and compensating employees for their costs resulting from this (4), the use of ecological cars by the company (5), as well as the company’s canteen offering organic food (6).

Activities reflecting the strategic aspect related to the practice and introduction of Sustainable HRM to the company’s strategy were diagnosed on the basis of the following statements: The HR department is involved in creating a sustainable development policy (1), the HR department has introduced sustainability into the company’s action plan (2), the HR department has financial resources and human capital to initiate and promote actions for sustainability (3), declarations of respondents that they see the benefits of taking initiatives for sustainability (4) and their organization could be considered a model in this respect (5), and sustainability is an opportunity for the HR department.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

to prove its strategic position in the company (6). It can be stated that these statements relate to the conscious (4 and 6) and behavioural (1, 2, 3, 5) aspects.

The responses were scaled using the seven-point Likert scale, on the basis of which the respondents assessed whether the action described in the statement was carried out in their company. The extreme values of the scale are “definitely no” (1) and “definitely yes” (7). The Cronbach’s alpha for the individual scales of the questionnaire is: 0.87; 0.87; 0.84; 0.89.

The statements included in the questionnaire made it possible to answer the questions of whether and what activities for Sustainable HRM are undertaken, according to the respondents, in their companies, and what is the relationship between activities undertaken by HR departments in the area of diversity management (social aspect), enabling the development of sustainable professional career (psychological aspect) as well as promoting pro-ecological behaviour (ecological aspect) and strategic HR activities. The answer to the above questions also allowed us to verify the research hypothesis.

# 2.3. Selection and Application of Statistical Methods

In the first step, the skewness of the distributions was calculated (Tables 1–4). The absolute value of the obtained results was interpreted as follows [66]: 0–0.2 very weak asymmetry (distribution close to symmetric); 0.2–0.4 weak distribution asymmetry; 0.4–0.6 asymmetry of distribution strong; above 0.8, the asymmetry of distribution is very strong. As in most of the statements, the distributions of the answers were asymmetric and the skewness coefficient ranged from moderate to very strong, the calculation of the arithmetic mean and standard deviations was omitted in favour of median and mode. The basis for drawing conclusions about the implementation by the company’s HR department of individual types of activities in the field of sustainable development was the analysis of the distribution of answer variants given by the respondents (Figures 1–4). It was assumed that the selection of the answers “rather yes” (5), “yes” (6), and “definitely yes” (7) proves that the HR department undertook such actions, and selecting the answers “definitely no” (1), “no” (2), “probably not” (3), and “don’t know” (4) suggest that no such action is taken. On this basis, it was determined whether and what activities related to diversity management, building a sustainable professional career for employees, and shaping pro-ecological attitudes are practised in enterprises represented by MBA course students, and what activities related to sustainable human resource management are introduced by the HR department to the company’s strategy. The relationship between taking actions related to the social, psychological, and environmental aspects in the area of HRM and the strategic aspect was calculated using the Spearman correlation coefficient. The obtained absolute values of the correlation coefficient were interpreted as follows [67]: r < 0.3, weak correlation; r < 0.5, moderate correlation; up to r < 0.7, high correlation; to r < 0.9, very high correlation; r < 1, the correlation is almost complete. In order to find out which variables (dimensions) significantly explain the shaping of the variables that make up the strategic aspect, regression models (multiple regression) were constructed. The calculations were made using the Statistica TIBCO 13.3 statistical package.

# Figure 2. The social aspect—undertaking activities for the benefit of various groups of employees.

Activities that make up the diversity management in an organization are practiced in at least some enterprises. When assessing individual statements on a seven-point scale, the respondents rarely chose the extreme answers (1 and 7) and the middle answer (4). In the case of statements 1, 2, 3, and 6, more than half of the respondents indicated that actions for specific groups of employees are undertaken in their enterprises (median 5). They concern activities for older workers, various age groups, people with disabilities, and women. In three groups, the mode was 6 (answer “yes”). On the other hand, when assessing activities for various cultural (statement 4) and religious (statement 5) groups, less than half (slightly more than 1/3) of respondents indicated that they were undertaken in their enterprises. The median was 4 and 3, respectively, and the mode was 3.

# 3.1.2. The Psychological Aspect

Detailed results concerning the possibility of pursuing a sustainable professional career by employees (psychological aspect) are presented in Table 3 and Figure 3. According to the respondents, their enterprises undertake activities enabling them to pursue a sustainable professional career. This applies in particular to creating opportunities for professional development (statement 4), incurring related costs by the company (statement 5), and treating employees.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

as a key resource of the organization (statement 1). In each of these statements, the distributions are strongly asymmetric (left-sided asymmetry—the percentage of affirmative answers is over 85%) and the median and mode were 6. The number of people choosing the affirmative answer definitely prevailed (78%) in the assessment of statement 2, concerning providing employees with work in line with their interests and talents, as well. However, the mode and median in the assessment of this statement were equal to 5, which means that at least half of the respondents answered “rather yes”. It was also the most frequently given answer. In the assessment of statements 3 (providing employees with coaching) and 6 (monitoring employees’ progress in behaviours for sustainable development), yes also prevailed (59% each), however, the asymmetry in the distribution of responses is smaller, and the most frequently chosen answer was “rather yes”—mode 5. When assessing practices used in the field of sustainable career development, the respondents rarely chose the extremely negative answer (only statements 5 and 6—4 and 3%, respectively) or the middle answer (from 0 to 13%).

# Figure 4. The ecological aspect—undertaking practices enabling employees to develop pro-ecological behaviours.

The analysis of the results shows a right-hand asymmetry of the distribution of variants of answers to most questions (except statement 3). The respondents most often stated that the pro-ecological practices indicated in the questionnaire were not undertaken in their enterprises or that they had a problem with an unambiguous response to particular statements (answer “hard to say”). Mode in all statements (except for 3) is 2 (answer “no”). Positive answers (from “rather yes” to “definitely yes”) did not prevail in the assessment of any of the statements.

The respondents most often (42%) indicated that employees in their enterprises use public transport to travel to work (statement 3). According to the respondents, the least frequently used practice (15% of positive answers) was compensating employees for the costs of commuting to work by public transport. Less than 1/3 of the respondents stated that their enterprise takes into account ecological criteria both at the stage of recruitment and employee evaluation.

In the evaluation of all statements, except for statement 2, the variants with the answer “yes” dominated (from 65 to 85% of responses). The evaluation of statements 4 and 6 concerning the consciousness aspect was higher than the others, as evidenced by a very high value of skewness coefficients as well as a median and a mode of 6.

When assessing the activities related to the implementation of Sustainable HRM into the company’s strategy, the majority of respondents declared that they were undertaken in terms of statements 1, 3, and 5. The median in each of them was 5, i.e., half of the respondents indicated at least the answer “rather yes”. However, the detailed distribution of answer variants differed. The most frequently chosen variant in statement 1 was “yes”, in statement 5 “rather yes”, and in statement 3 the distribution of answers was bimodal—the most common answers were “rather yes” and “yes”.

The weakest asymmetry of the distribution and the lowest median were observed in the assessment of statement 2 (introducing sustainability into the company’s action plan). The median was 4, and affirmative answers were slightly less than half of the total (48%). At the same time, a high percentage (21%) of respondents had a problem with an unambiguous assessment of this statement, thus selecting the middle value on the scale.

Empty fields in the table indicate no correlation or weak correlations, which were not included in the analysis.

All the observed correlations between the individual statements that make up the strategic aspect and the others are positive, most often moderate, and strong in several cases. The highest number of correlations was observed between the strategic and psychological aspects, and the least—between the strategic and environmental ones.

# 3.2.1. The Strategic Aspect and the Social Aspect

Strong correlations were observed between strategic statements 2 and 5 (“HR has introduced sustainability into the company’s action plan”; “I think my organization could be a model for other organizations when it comes to promoting sustainability activities”) and social statements 1 and 2 (actions for older workers and different age groups), as well as between strategic statement 4 (“I see benefits for the company from taking initiatives for sustainability”) and the social statement 1. The other observed correlations are moderate.

# 3.2.2. The Strategic Aspect and the Psychological Aspect

Correlations exist between most of the statements that make up both the strategic and psychological aspects. A strong positive relationship was observed between statements 4–6 of the strategic aspect (noticing the benefits of taking actions for sustainability, the organization can be a model in this field, an opportunity for the HR department to raise its strategic position) and the psychological statement 1 (treating employees as a key resource in the organization), between strategic statements 4 and 6 and psychological statement 5 (covering the costs of training by the company) and between strategic statements 5 and 6 and psychological statements 6 (monitoring employees’ progress in sustainable development behaviour). The remaining observed correlations are of moderate strength.

# 3.2.3. The Strategic Aspect and the Ecological Aspect

Out of the 6 statements that make up the strategic aspect, only 3 correlate with selected statements that make up the ecological aspect. The strength of the correlation is weak to moderate. Strategic statement 1 (involvement of the HR department in creating sustainable development policy) is correlated with statements 1–3 and 5–6 that make up the ecological aspect. Strategic statement 2 (introducing sustainability into a company’s action plan) correlates with environmental statements 1–4, and strategic statement 5 (organization as a model for promoting sustainability activities) with environmental statements 1 and 2.

Summarizing the analysis of the correlation between the strategic aspect of Sustainable HRM and the social, psychological, and ecological aspect, one can observe an emerging tendency that correlations occur more often and with greater power between these variants of answers, constituting particular aspects in which enterprises take specific actions, which confirms the usefulness of the adopted research model.

# 3.3. Multiple Regression of the Strategic Aspect in Relation to the Social, Psychological, and Ecological Aspects

In order to establish the relationship between the variables forming the individual Sustainable HRM dimensions, regression models were constructed. Six regression models, in which the dependent variables were individual questions concerning the strategic aspect, while the independent variables were questions concerning the social, psychological, and ecological aspect, were examined. Regression models for dependent variables strategic (i − 1,..., 6) are described by the equation:

STi = α0 +∑αj ∗ SOj +∑αj+6 ∗ Pj +∑αj+12 ∗ Ej

where ST—Strategic; SO—Social; P—Psychological; E—Ecological.

The normality of the rest of the regression model was checked in each case. Based on the scattering plots of the model residuals with respect to the predicted residuals, it was concluded that the residuals were homoscedastic and non-correlated, and the existence of outliers in the model was checked on the basis of Cook’s distance. Analysis of the PLOTS of predicted residual values for all models showed that they are constructed correctly. The residuals in the model have normal distributions, and residual homoscedasticity is present. Cook’s distance analysis also shows that there are no outliers in the individual models.

The only significant variable that influences the Strategic Aspect 1 is the Psychological 3 aspect of providing employees with coaching. R2 in the model is 0.55, and the p-value in Fisher’s significance test is 0.00011.

The Strategic aspect 2 is influenced by the Social aspect 1. The Fisher test shows that the model is statistically significant, with p-value 0.00011 and R2 for the model 0.55.

The factor with a statistically significant impact on the Strategic aspect 3 is the Ecological aspect 3. The model as a whole is statistically significant, as evidenced by the p-value in the Fisher test p = 0.0052. R2 in the model is 0.45.

In model 4, the factors significantly influencing the Strategic 4 variable are the Psychological 1, Psychological 4, Psychological 5, and Ecological 1 aspects, where the p-value in Fisher’s significance test is p < 0.0000 and R2 is 0.69.

In the regression model 5, the Strategic 5 variable is significantly influenced by Social 1 and Psychological 6 aspects. R2 in the model is 0.61, while the p-value in the model significance test is 0.0001.

In the last constructed regression model, the Strategic 6 variable is significantly influenced by the Psychological 1 and Psychological 4 variables. R2 in the model is 0.57, while the p-value in the Fisher significance test is 0.0003.

To sum up, there were 18 independent variables (Social 1–6, Psychological 1–6, Ecological 1–6) analysed. The dependent variables (Strategic 1–6) are influenced by 11 independent ones. Ten of them explain well how only one aspect is developing. On the other hand, Social 1 explains well the shaping of two aspects (strategic 2 and 5). Moreover, the Psychological 4 aspect explains well the shaping of Strategic 4 and 6 aspects.

# 4. Conclusions and Discussion

The research model adopted in this research has been positively verified, indicating the dual role of the HR department in taking actions in the field of diversity management and developing a sustainable career as well as introducing those actions into the organization’s strategy.

On the basis of the conducted analysis, it can be concluded that in the surveyed companies, there are moderate and strong correlations between taking actions for various groups of employees and sustainable career development and their introduction to the company’s strategy. Additionally, on the basis of the constructed regression models, it was determined which of the analysed aspects (variables creating the social, psychological, and ecological aspect) significantly affect the strategic aspect. Thus, the adopted research model turned out to be useful in relation to the study of the relationship between the social, psychological, and ecological aspect and the strategic aspect, pointing to the dual role of HR departments. The adopted research model also allowed us to indicate which activities, to the greatest extent, contribute to increasing the effectiveness of HR departments in realizing Sustainable HRM endeavours.

When analysing the results obtained in terms of particular aspects of HRM, it can be noticed that they often relate to activities resulting from the existing legal solutions. This applies, inter alia, to activities undertaken for the benefit of various employee groups. By law, elderly, adolescent, disabled, and women employees are entitled to special protection.

In terms of solutions related to the development of a sustainable professional career of employees, attention should be paid to the economic interest of the organization and certain customary solutions. In recent years, the labour market in Poland has taken on the character of an employee’s market. Due to the difficulty of obtaining qualified employees, employers were forced to incur greater expenditure on employee training.

Podlasie is a relatively poor region. This also applies to companies operating there. This is the most likely explanation for the lack of results indicating the undertaking of pro-ecological activities included in the study. The purchase of green cars or subsidies for employees using public transport are additional costs, which may comprise an impossible barrier for many companies. An additional problem arises in the use of public transport by employees. Some of the smaller towns have rather poor infrastructure and transportation connection, and using their own means of transport is often the only possible means to travel to work. Regarding the statement about organic food offered in canteens, two factors may have influenced the distribution of the response value. Some enterprises, especially smaller ones, may not have their own canteens. Secondly, certified organic food is more expensive than non-organic, which can also be a barrier for companies.

The results of this part of the research are not unique, as research conducted among Finnish top managers showed that, contrary to the prior green HRM literature, ecological responsibility was largely ignored [34]. Finland, like Poland, has a restrictive legal system with regard to environmental protection, and this may mean that the environmental aspect has automatically become part of the mentality of Finnish companies. Podlaskie is a region whose land is mostly categorized as Natura 2000 areas. This means that entrepreneurs are obliged now to respect strict environmental protection standards. Consequently, it is likely that they are convinced that their compliance with applicable legal norms meets their environmental obligations. However, this is a hypothesis that should be verified in further research.

On the other hand, another possible explanation for the low environmental aspect correlation can be attributed to the historic disregard for environmental matters. There is a limited amount of

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8987

research conducted so far covering the environmental problems in Central Europe. Š. Waisova [68] considered environmental governance in the Visegard Group (V4). The group includes four Central European countries: Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and The Czech Republic. The Visegrad countries have a common communist heritage. All were previously regimes with an economic emphasis on the metallurgic industry, mining, and intensive centralized agriculture. Environmental protection and the interest in environmental changes and threats were very low on the priority list for many years in those countries. Because of their geopolitical situation, history, and physical geography, Poland and Hungary in particular are linked to environmental issues that go beyond Central Europe and call for far wider environmental action. Perhaps partially due to the historical footprint, Polish organizations might correlate the lowest with the environmental aspect. However, this hypothesis should be verified in further research.

Existing research on Sustainable HRM includes research by K. Piwowar-Sulej [69] on the development of future competencies of industrial engineers in Poland. This group is responsible for the implementation of Industry 4.0 concept and cleaner production in the country. As K. Piwowar-Sulej’s research suggests, industrial companies in Poland tend to be short-sighted when developing the potential of their engineers. The author concludes that the HR development practices focus mainly on current and ongoing needs, there is a lack of employee participation in the process of making training-related decisions, and the environmental sustainability remains a neglected area of knowledge in terms of training. This also could be one of the factors contributing to the low correlation to the environmental aspect in this research.

Other existing research relates to the role of HR department managers and was done by K. Drela [32]. The results of her research confirmed that HR managers of enterprises operating in the area of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship play a very active role in managing the initiatives related to sustainable development, and in introducing sustainability measures into corporate strategies. The results obtained by K. Drela further confirm and strengthen the role of HR in Corporate Sustainability.

As existing research results are not coherent, it seems worth consulting a wider-group research, encompassing varied employee groups and industry sectors to obtain a more comprehensive view on a national scale.

The limitations of the research group were also a limitation for this research. The research group represented only a part of the organizations operating in Podlasie. Furthermore, the research group was comprised of MBA students only. Hence, it encompassed only some members of the HR departments of the researched organizations. Therefore, one of the further research ideas include conducting the research with a bigger research group of Podlasie companies, and thus creating a more complete database for the country.

Moreover, further research could also focus on other regions within the country to contribute to a wider data collection. The research model created in this research has wide applications, as it can be used in research without geographical limitations. It can also be utilized in varied sectors (public or business) and branches of the economy. What is more, the research in particular regions could be repeated on a regular basis. The results thereof could serve as the basis for following the process of Corporate Sustainability implementation.

Corporate sustainability confronts managers with tensions between complex economic, environmental, and social issues. Drawing on the literature on managerial cognition, corporate sustainability, and strategic paradoxes, we develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We propose two cognitive frames—a business case frame and a paradoxical frame—and explore how differences between them in cognitive content and structure influence the three stages of the sensemaking process—that is, managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues. We explain how the two frames lead to differences in the breadth and depth of scanning, differences in issue interpretations in terms of sense of control and issue valence, and different types of responses that managers consider with regard to sustainability issues. By considering alternative cognitive frames, our argument contributes to a better understanding of managerial decision making regarding ambiguous sustainability issues, and it develops the underlying cognitive determinants of the stance that managers adopt on sustainability issues. This argument offers a cognitive explanation for why managers rarely push for radical change when faced with complex and ambiguous issues, such as sustainability, that are characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects.

Corporate sustainability requires managers to simultaneously address widely diverging but interconnected concerns for the natural environment, social welfare, and economic prosperity (Bansal, 2002; Gladwin, Kennelly, & Krause, 1995; Maon, Lindgreen, & Swaen, 2008). As a consequence, corporate decision makers “face a great deal of ambiguity in understanding the issues, the implications of these issues for their organizations, and ways to respond to these issues” (Sharma, 2000: 683). The question of how managers make sense of such ambiguous cues from their organizational context has increasingly been addressed from a cognitive perspective (for overviews see Hodgkinson & Healey, 2008; Porac & Thomas, 2002; Walsh, 1995). Through cognitive frames, which act as “cognitive filters that admit certain bits of information into the strategizing process while excluding others” (Porac & Thomas, 2002: 178), managers imbue ambiguous cues with meaning, which leads them to consider specific strategic responses (Weick, 1995).

Several authors have applied a cognitive lens to the analysis of corporate sustainability and related concepts, such as corporate social responsibility or corporate citizenship (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Maon et al., 2008; Sharma, 2000; Sharma, Pablo, & Vredenburg, 1999).

detailed analysis of the effects that cognitive frames with different content and structure have on managers’ sensemaking of the ambiguities around sustainability is still lacking (Angus-Leppan, Benn, & Young, 2010; Byrch, Kearins, Milne, & Morgan, 2007; Zietsma & Vertinsky, 1999). In particular, the strong focus on business case thinking (Carroll & Shabana, 2010) that permeates research on corporate sustainability (Bansal, 2005; Gao & Bansal, 2013; Hahn, Figge, Pinkse, & Preuss, 2010) has resulted in a situation where managerial responses to sustainability issues are conceptualized along an opportunity/threat dichotomy (Andersson Bateman, 2000; Sharma, 2000) dominated by economic objectives of the firm. In contrast, our aim is to generate a better understanding of the underlying cognitive determinants of different responses to sustainability issues that managers consider.

Drawing on the literature on managerial cognition, corporate sustainability, and strategic paradoxes (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005), we develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We propose two cognitive frames—a business case frame and a paradoxical frame—to explore how differences in cognitive content and structure influence the three stages of the sensemaking process—that is, scanning, interpreting, and responding (Daft & Weick, 1984; Thomas, Clark, & Gioia, 1993). The two frames are based on contrasting views of the relationship between the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability and result in different decision-making stances on sustainability issues. We propose that managers with a business case frame focus on environmental and social aspects that align with economic objectives and, thus, interpret sustainability issues univalently as either positive or negative for their business; hence, they adopt a pragmatic stance on sustainability issues, with a propensity to pursue narrow but workable responses along existing routines and solutions. In contrast, with their awareness of multiple and conflicting economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability issues, managers with a paradoxical frame develop more ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues; as a consequence, they adopt a prudent stance, where they consider more comprehensive responses, but because of their higher awareness of risk and tensions, they move forward slowly and carefully.

As our main contribution, we advance theorizing about managerial decision making by considering the effects of alternative cognitive frames on the sensemaking process of sustainability issues. Our examination of the differences in content and structure of managers’ cognitive frames offers a more sophisticated understanding of the responses to sustainability issues they consider. We offer testable propositions on the effects of the two frames on managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues. Our argument results in a cognitive explanation for why managers—owing to the predispositions and limitations inherent in both frames—rarely push for radical change in the face of the immense challenges that sustainability presents. More generally, our plea to consider a greater cognitive diversity contributes to a better understanding of how managers make sense of ambiguous issues that are characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects.

We organize the article as follows. We first develop the business case frame and the paradoxical frame with regard to their content and structure. We then develop propositions on how the two frames influence managerial sensemaking of sustainability issues, as well as on the most important factors that moderate these effects. In concluding the article we discuss key implications and offer avenues for future research.

# COGNITIVE FRAMING AND MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING

Decision makers operate in turbulent organizational contexts with complex and ambiguous signals. According to cognitive categorization theory, individuals use cognitive heuristics to make sense of such complex situations (Mervis & Rosch, 1981; Rosch, 1975). As complexity increases, sensemaking shifts from being perception based to being category based, since people’s “cognitive processing becomes schema-driven . . . and they . . . assign a handful of their direct perceptions to types, categories, stereotypes, and schemas” (Weick, 2010: 541). Correspondingly, research on managerial cognition suggests that managers interpret and make sense of ambiguous and complex signals.

through cognitive frames (for overviews see Hodgkinson & Healey, 2008; Porac & Thomas, 2002; Walsh, 1995). A cognitive frame is a “mental template that individuals impose on an information environment to give it form and meaning” (Walsh, 1995: 281). These frames are produced and reproduced by individuals through labeling objects and situations according to observed attributes.

Because human rationality is bounded, managers do not achieve a complete understanding of strategic situations; rather, they use cognitive frames to “develop subjective representations of the environment that, in turn, drive their strategic decisions and subsequent firm action” (Nadkarni & Barr, 2008: 1395). Through cognitive frames managers reduce complexity and ambiguity by selectively organizing and interpreting signals from the organizational context (Dutton & Jackson, 1987). At the same time, cognitive framing occurs “on the basis of past learning and categorization” (Mervis & Rosch, 1981: 89) and, thus, is self-referring and retrospective, which results in a confirmatory bias that directs attention toward signals that fit existing frames and away from signals that are inconsistent with these frames (Palich & Bagby, 1995). Hence, cognitive framing can also limit decision makers’ understanding of a situation since it “may encourage stereotypic thinking; subvert controlled information processing; fill data gaps with typical but perhaps inaccurate information; prompt one to ignore discrepant and possibly important information; discourage disconfirmation of the existing knowledge structure; and inhibit creative problem solving” (Walsh, 1995: 282).

Following Walsh (1995), we distinguish between the content and the structure of a cognitive frame. Cognitive content “consists of the things he or she knows, assumes and believes,” while cognitive structure denotes “how the content is arranged, connected or studied in the executive’s mind” (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996: 57). The content of a cognitive frame relates to a particular domain, such as corporate strategy making (Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994) or entrepreneurship (Shepherd, 1999). Within a domain, frame content captures a person’s ascription of attributes to objects and events, where an “attribute is any basis a person uses to distinguish or group objects and events” (Scott, Osgood, & Peterson, 1979: 36). Attributes that serve to differentiate objects and events into categories are said to have high cue validity (Dutton & Jackson, 1987). With regard to the structure of a cognitive frame, Bartunek, Gordon, and Weathersby suggested that the two primary dimensions are “differentiation—the ability to perceive several dimensions in a stimulus array—and integration—the development of complex connections among the differentiated characteristics” (1983: 274). Differentiation captures the number of elements within a frame, and integration describes the degree of interconnectedness among these elements (Walsh, 1995). Taken together, structure and content of a particular cognitive frame lead to a particular interpretation of a situation and, in turn, to a particular managerial response (Tikkanen, Lamberg, Parvinen, & Kallunki, 2005).

# COGNITIVE FRAMING IN MANAGERIAL DECISION MAKING ON SUSTAINABILITY

Corporate sustainability “refers to a company’s activities . . . demonstrating the inclusion of social and environmental concerns in business operations and in interactions with stakeholders” (van Marrewijk & Werre, 2003: 107). Corporate sustainability deals with a multitude of demands and objectives at organizational and societal levels that appear desirable in isolation but are “inextricably connected and internally interdependent” (Bansal, 2002: 123). It therefore produces a decision-making context with highly ambiguous signals, where decision making strongly depends on the frame managers use (Bogner & Barr, 2000; Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994; Kaplan, 2008). First, from the perspective of sustainability, firms need to address economic as well as environmental and social outcomes, which have to be achieved simultaneously (Elkington, 1997; Gao & Bansal, 2013). This need to address various desirable but interdependent outcomes simultaneously leads to a risk of unintended consequences, since a solution to one issue could be detrimental to that of another (Newton, 2002). Second, sustainability suggests that “business firms are expected to improve the general welfare of society” (Schwartz & Carroll, 2008: 168). This reference to multidimensional outcomes at the societal level complicates the objective function of the firm (Jensen, 2001), because it comes in addition to financial performance goals at the organizational level. Because of a strong focus on intergenerational

fairness (WCED, 1987), sustainability also “emphasizes the long-term nature of the benefit that business is expected to provide to society” (Schwartz & Carroll, 2008: 163), as opposed to the oftentimes short-term focus of managerial decision making (Held, 2001; Slawinski & Bansal, 2012). Third, sustainability involves the simultaneous recognition of various and often conflicting demands of a wider set of stakeholders (Clarkson, 1995; Maon et al., 2008), who apply decision logics that are different from those of managers and shareholders (Hahn, in press).

Overall, sustainability confronts managers with situations in which they need to simultaneously address multiple desirable but conflicting economic, environmental, and social outcomes at firm and societal levels that operate in different time frames and follow different logics. At the same time, firms and managers are being criticized for their reluctance to adopt radical responses to address sustainability concerns (Whiteman, Walker, & Perego, 2013). To gain greater insights into corporate sustainability decision making, it is therefore critical to understand which cognitive frames managers use to cognitively process these ambiguities (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Maon et al., 2008; Sharma, 2000; Sharma et al., 1999).

# Business Case Frame and Paradoxical Frame

Many of the ambiguities that surround sustainability stem from the interrelated yet conflicting nature of economic, environmental, and social outcomes (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). We develop two cognitive frames that reflect decision makers’ assumptions regarding the relationship of these aspects of sustainability on the basis of work by Smith and colleagues (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005), who suggest two approaches for managers to deal with ambiguities. The first approach is based on an alignment logic and reflects the “belief in a unitary truth [which] means inconsistencies cannot fundamentally coexist” (Smith & Tushman, 2005: 525). It holds that managers deal with ambiguities by trying to eliminate tensions—that is, they seek situations with a fit between various factors and look for contingencies that reconcile any inconsistencies (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Such a need to eliminate tensions resonates with the business case for corporate sustainability, which argues for an alignment of social and environmental outcomes with financial performance (Carroll & Shabana, 2010; Salzmann, Ionescu-Somers, & Steger, 2005). We therefore label the first cognitive frame the business case frame.

The second approach of Smith and colleagues stipulates that in complex organizational contexts tensions and inconsistencies are highly salient and cannot be eliminated (Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). It emphasizes that by using paradoxical thinking managers accept tensions and accommodate conflicting yet interrelated economic, environmental, and social concerns, rather than eliminate them (Gao & Bansal, 2013; Smith & Lewis, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Accordingly, we label the second cognitive frame the paradoxical frame (Miron-Spektor, Gino, & Argote, 2011; Smith & Tushman, 2005). Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the two frames.

The two frames represent ideal types (Doty & Glick, 1994) in the sense of accentuated abstractions of how managers conceive of the relationship between and among the economic, environmental, and social aspects of sustainability. Representing the end points of a continuum, the two ideal-type frames conceptualize this relationship by either aligning environmental and social aspects with the economic dimension (business case frame) or by accepting and accommodating the interrelated yet contradictory nature of all three aspects (paradoxical frame). Since ideal types rarely exist in pure form, the actual frames of decision makers will lie between the end points and resemble the ideal types to different degrees (Doty & Glick, 1994). Actual frames thus consist of different combinations of the underlying constructs—that is, frame content and structure—of the two ideal-type frames.

Content. The content of the two frames is defined by the attributes decision makers use when they make sense of ambiguous cues and differs with regard to the dominance and diversity of these attributes. As developed above, the business case frame follows an alignment logic, which puts economic attributes first.1 Social and

1 Alignment can be based on different rationales, depending on which kinds of attributes dominate the content of a cognitive frame. Conceptually speaking, an ecological case frame or a social case frame, where environmental or social attributes dominate, respectively, would also follow an

# Characteristics of the Business Case Frame and the Paradoxical Frame

|Frame Characteristics|Business Case Frame|Paradoxical Frame|
|---|---|---|
|Content|Exclusive focus on business attributes|Combination of multiple attributes with different rationales|
|Structure|Simple|Complex|
|Differentiation|Low number of frame elements|High number of frame elements|
|Integration|Low degree of connectedness with singular focus on economic means-ends relationships|High degree of connectedness with a plurality of reinforcing, neutral, and conflicting relationships|
|Implicit goal|Improve economic performance at the organizational level|Address economic, environmental, and social concerns at organizational and societal levels|
|Underlying logic|Business case thinking: Alignment of environmental and social concerns with economic objectives|Paradoxical thinking: Juxtaposition of economic, environmental, and social concerns, even if contradictory|
|Treatment of tensions|Elimination|Acceptance|

Environmental aspects are only taken into account when they can be aligned with financial contradictions (Smith & Tushman, 2005: 533)—to accommodate competing yet interrelated economic, environmental, and social concerns that reside at different levels and operate in different logics and time frames (Byrch et al., 2007; Gao & Bansal, 2013). However, since the paradoxical frame does not systematically emphasize one sustainability dimension over any other, it does not offer unequivocal guidance on which aspect of a sustainability issue to prioritize.

Structure. The differences in content and underlying logic between the two frames also influence the frames’ structure, both with regard to the number of salient frame elements (i.e., the degree of differentiation) and the complexity and multitude of connections between these elements (i.e., the degree of integration). For the business case frame, the strong focus on economic attributes results in comparatively low degrees of differentiation and integration. Differentiation is low because the economic focus limits the number of attributes represented. Integration is also low because, owing to its emphasis on aligning environmental and social concerns with financial performance, this frame only considers connections between frame elements that are based on hierarchical means-ends relationships. Other, more complex relations, where social and environmental aspects do not align with financial performance, are not taken into account. However, the consideration of only a limited set of connections does allow managers with a business case frame to eliminate inconsistencies and tensions (Smith & Tushman, 2005).

Lewis, 2011; Weick, 1995) and to reduce com- complexity and ambiguity of the issue (Levinthal & Rerup, 2006; Porac & Rosa, 1996). A paradoxical frame has a more complex structure. The inclusiveness of this frame results in a higher degree of differentiation since it accommodates frame elements covering all three sustainability dimensions. While the high degree of differentiation refers to the inclusion of a wide variety of attributes, this frame also has a higher degree of integration since it takes into account different reinforcing, neutral, and conflicting connections between and among sustainability dimensions.

# Relationship Between the Two Frames

As noted above, the business case frame and the paradoxical frame represent two ideal-type conceptualizations of how managers relate economic, environmental, and social concerns to each other. They represent the end points of a continuum, with a full alignment with economic objectives at the one end and a combination of interrelated yet conflicting economic, environmental, and social concerns at the other end. Although as ideal types the business case frame and the paradoxical frame are distinct, actual frames represent different combinations of content and structure of the two ideal types (see Figure 1). Starting with the business case frame at the one extreme, once a frame starts to include salient environmental and social attributes, in addition to economic attributes, its content gets more diverse and its structure more differentiated (upward move in Figure 1). With the number of frame elements increasing, the number of possible connections between elements grows disproportionately. The higher the number and the greater the diversity of frame elements, the more complex and diverse the interconnections. Hence, the cognitive frame has a higher degree of integration, which will eventually result in the paradoxical frame at the other extreme (rightward move in Figure 1). The more a frame is rooted in an alignment logic (business case frame), the greater its focus but the lower its complexity. In contrast, the more a frame uses paradoxical thinking (paradoxical frame), the higher its complexity but the lower its focus.

We propose that these two ideal-type frames are useful heuristic devices to understand managerial decision making in a sustainability context. We now develop the consequences of each frame for the process of managerial sensemaking of sustainability issues. Exploring the consequences of the two cognitive frames provides a more comprehensive understanding of managerial cognition on ambiguities around sustainability (Walsh, 1995).

# SENSEMAKING OF CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY WITH THE BUSINESS CASE FRAME AND THE PARADOXICAL FRAME

Sensemaking occurs as a sequence of three core processes: scanning, interpreting, and responding (Daft & Weick, 1984; Thomas et al., 1993). Below we develop the differences in terms of managerial scanning, interpreting, and responding with regard to sustainability issues depending on whether decision makers hold a business case frame or a paradoxical frame. In the scanning phase decision makers reduce the amount and complexity of information, and, depending on the frame they hold, notice different aspects of a situation, in turn leading to differences in their information processing and interpretation of the situation. In the interpretation phase any given situation may be understood as relevant by some but perceived as irrelevant or completely overlooked by others (Barr & Huff, 1997). Assigning more or less relevance and specific meaning to the information then has consequences for the managers’ strategic response.

# Scanning

“Scanning involves information gathering; it usually is considered an antecedent to interpretation and action” (Thomas et al., 1993: 240). Because of their cognitive limitations, decision makers are exposed to more information than they can process (Mintzberg, 1973); hence, “executives can perceive only a selected portion of the environment” (Das & Teng, 1999: 764). Decision makers scan information according to the relevance they assign to it based on their cognitive frames (Hambrick, 1982; Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). Owing to the confirmatory bias of cognitive framing, they selectively notice information that conforms to their cognitive frames and ignore information that contradicts these frames (Nickerson, 1998; Palich & Bagby, 1995). They also fill gaps with frame-consistent information and tend to miss extreme or highly surprising information because it escapes their cognitive categories (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982).

Important aspects of scanning refer to the depth and breadth of the information that managers collect (Beyer et al., 1997; Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997; Walsh, 1988) on sustainability issues (Mazutis, 2013). Information collection operates on a continuum between, at one extreme, focused search, where decision makers are looking for specific information with a clear purpose in mind, and, at the other extreme, general browsing through information, “without a particular problem to solve or question to answer” (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997: 83). Regarding the breadth of perceived aspects, Beyer and colleagues found that “the more restricted the observational goals of decision makers, the more selective their perceptions will be” (1997: 720). Similarly, the more managers attend to selected targets and previously formed hypotheses about the relationship between different aspects, the more “they might overlook information and evidence that may prove the opposite” (Das & Teng, 1999: 762). That is, a priori objectives and hypotheses selectively highlight particular cues from the organizational context (Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988).

The business case frame, with its content built on economic attributes and its structure based on an alignment logic, provides managers with strong direction but, at the same time, restricts observational goals. We thus expect managers with a business case frame to perceive a rather narrow portion of the information on a sustainability issue. They will more easily absorb information they perceive as having business relevance and that is structured similar to other business information, which is very often expressed in quantitative terms (Daft & Weick, 1984). For instance, the publication of the “Stern Review” attracted managerial attention because it presented monetary estimates of the economic damage caused by climate change. Crucially, the report presented climate change as a business opportunity, stressing the benefits of early action as a way to prevent the costs of remaining inactive (Stern, 2006).

Decision makers with cognitive frames of low complexity also tend to collect information from fewer selected sources (Karlins, 1967; Stabell, 1978). Accordingly, managers with a business case frame will limit their attention to sustainability-related claims of stakeholders closely related to the market environment, since these will be perceived as more powerful and relevant for business (Mitchell, Agle, & Wood, 1997). People tend to stereotype information depending on its source (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982), so decision makers with a business case frame will attend less to environmental and social issues brought forward by stakeholders having no direct impact.

pact on their business. For instance, in the 1970s General Motors’ upper management did not consider many suggestions for smaller, less pollut-ing cars because they were brought forward by groups outside the scope of the executives’ focus (Wright, 1979). Consequently, managers with a business case frame will not take full notice of the multitude of sustainability issues and claims that arise in their organizational contexts. The more the frames of decision makers focus on economic attributes and an alignment logic, the more decision makers tend to perceive issues only once these have progressed to later stages of the issue life cycle—that is, when actors with direct business relevance, such as regulators or competitors, have adopted the issue (Mahon & Waddock, 1992; Wartick & Mahon, 1994).

While the business case frame limits the breadth of managerial scanning, it enables managers to approach decision situations with known objectives (Das & Teng, 1999). Following an alignment logic, managers probe the environmental and social aspects they notice for potential economic benefits. With this narrow focus the business case frame provides clear direction and reduces uncertainties regarding which aspects managers should look for (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). The clear focus on the business relevance of sustainability issues allows managers to employ highly formalized and clearly structured search routines to collect detailed information (Das & Teng, 1999). Consequently, we expect that managers with a business case frame will be more likely to collect detailed information on how selected sustainability issues contribute to financial performance. Overall, we argue that the business case frame will lead managers to notice rather few sustainability issues but to seek detailed information, based on readily available, quantitative information at advanced stages of the issue life cycle, on how selected aspects of these issues relate to financial outcomes (see Figure 2).

# Proposition 1a:

The more business case oriented their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to notice a narrow range of sustainability issues based on focused search with little breadth, but with detailed information on how these issues relate to economic objectives.

The paradoxical frame does not direct decision makers toward clearly defined objectives and previously formed hypotheses about one specific type of relationship between different sustainability aspects. Rather, we expect managers with this frame to have a less selective perception of sustainability issues (Beyer et al., 1997). With their more complex frame structure and frame content comprising more diverse economic, environmental, and social attributes, decision makers will scan more broadly and attend to a wider range of aspects of sustainability issues, even if they are contradictory. Moreover, as Stabell argued, decision makers with complex frames will tend “to combine the information from a wide variety of information sources as the individual is able to generate perspectives that can integrate such a diversity of information” (1997: 720). Decision makers with a paradoxical frame will thus gather more diverse information on sustainability issues—that is, information related to economic, environmental, and social aspects—irrespective of immediate financial implications (Byrch et al., 2007). Because they hold a more complex conceptualization of their business (Crilly & Sloan, 2012), they will gather quantitative and qualitative, as well as financial and nonfinancial, information. They will also take note of opinions held by a wider range of stakeholders (Daft & Lengel, 1986; Wong, Ormiston, & Tetlock, 2011) and notice signals from diffuse sources with little or no immediate relevance.

2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 471

diate business relevance, as well as from earlier stages of the issue life cycle (Halme, 2002; Wartick & Mahon, 1994). Since the structure of the paradoxical frame encompasses conflicting relations between different sustainability dimensions, decision makers will be more likely to notice redundant and inconsistent information. Their information collection will be less structured and less formalized, because increasing formalization “constrains the information that decision makers can take into account” (Heidmann, Schäffer, & Strahringer, 2008: 246). For instance, biodiversity represents an issue that is still at an early stage in its life cycle, and managers struggle with how to make sense of it (Financial Times, 2012). Since biodiversity relates to many different ecological processes, managers need to scan beyond traditional business sources to comprehend the complexity of the issue. Hence, the CEO of global cement firm Holcim initiated a partnership in 2007 with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), an environmental NGO dedicated to biodiversity, to collect independent expert opinion on the relevance of biodiversity for Holcim (Imboden, Gross, Meynell, Richards, & Stalmans, 2010).

However, the paradoxical frame does not emphasize one sustainability dimension over any other, so it does not provide an unequivocal direction for information collection. Scanning might be broad, but also rather vague, since breadth comes at the expense of detailed information search (Das & Teng, 1999). With their complex and broad frame, managers may perceive too many issues and aspects as potentially relevant (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). Owing to their limited cognitive capacities (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982), decision makers cannot collect, process, and store detailed information on a wide range of sustainability aspects, as well as on the complex interconnections between them; hence, uncertainties will remain. While decision makers can cope with tensions and uncertainties through paradoxical thinking, their scanning will remain inconclusive. Overall, we expect that the less their cognitive frame is focused on alignment, the wider the variety of aspects of numerous sustainability issues managers will notice but the less they will be able to collect detailed information on the various aspects of these issues and their interrelations (see Figure 2).

# Proposition 1b:

The more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to notice a wide range of aspects of numerous sustainability issues based on broad browsing, but with a lack of detailed information.

Since cognitive frames are acquired and learned through a manager’s career history (Hodgkinson & Johnson, 1994; Porac & Thomas, 2002), we expect that the functional background of decision makers will influence their scanning of strategic issues (Beyer et al., 1997; Sutcliffe & Huber, 1998; Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997; Walsh, 1988). According to previous research, functional background influences the breadth and depth of scanning, because managers with different functional backgrounds favor different search modes (Beyer et al., 1997). Managers with a background in internally oriented functions, such as engineering, accounting, and finance, have the tendency to be more task oriented and to focus more on internal efficiency (Hambrick & Mason, 1984), as well as on unidimensional and clearly structured outcomes (Thomas & Simerly, 1994). They are thus more likely to perform focused search in a structured and formalized manner (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). Managers from externally oriented functions, such as marketing, research, and product development (Hambrick & Mason, 1984), are more often exposed to situations where stakeholder demands are in conflict (Maon et al., 2008). Hence, they tend to be “more adept at recognizing the multiple demands of their stakeholders [and the] competing interests of their constituents” (Thomas & Simerly, 1994: 962). These managers are more familiar with collecting information through broad and less structured browsing (Vandenbosch & Huff, 1997). We therefore expect that managers with a background in externally oriented functions will tend to scan more broadly but in less detail, while those with an internally oriented functional background will tend to scan less broadly but in more detail (as indicated by the arrows in Figure 2).

# Proposition 2a:

Decision makers with a background in externally oriented functions will scan more broadly but with less detail, which will weaken the effects of the business case frame on scanning.

# Proposition 2b

Decision makers with a background in internally oriented functions will scan less broadly but with more detail, which will weaken the effects of the paradoxical frame on scanning.

Managers’ perceptions of ambiguous cues from the organizational context are not only constrained by their cognitive capacities and personal characteristics but also by situational factors. When dealing with conflicting information and disparate stakeholder interests, managers usually do so under time pressure and resource limitations (Mann & Tan, 1993). Hence, scholars often argue that a greater availability of resources will enhance managers’ ability to collect more detailed and broader information on sustainability issues, since collecting and processing information on a broad range of sustainability issues is time consuming and costly (Bansal, 2005; Bowen, 2002; Sharma, 2000). Additional time and resources “can facilitate search activity which is not necessarily problem-related” (Bowen, 2002: 311) and can provide the latitude to perform searches on aspects and issues that may not have an immediate payoff (Levinthal & March, 1981). However, we argue that the effect of resource availability on managerial scanning of sustainability issues will not be categorical. The breadth of scanning by managers with a business case frame is not primarily limited by a lack of time or resources but, rather, by the focus of the frame content on economic attributes and by its alignment structure. Even with abundant resources, these managers are not likely to perform a broader search. They will still fail to notice information on sustainability issues that is presented in nonfinancial, qualitative terms and that has an ambiguous relation to financial outcomes. Conversely, the information search of managers with a paradoxical frame is limited by their capacity to collect and process detailed information on a broad range of sustainability issues. Part of this limitation will be due to their limited cognitive capacities to handle large amounts of information (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). However, the availability of additional time and resources will allow these managers to collect more detailed information on the broad range of sustainability issues they have noticed. We therefore suggest the following relation between resource availability and scanning (see the dotted curve in Figure 2).

# Proposition 3

The availability of additional time and resources will enable decision makers with a paradoxical frame to scan in more detail but will not increase the breadth of scanning of decision makers with a business case frame.

# Interpreting

“Interpretation is the act of carving out meaning from ambiguous cues and is the very core of the sensemaking process” (Porac & Thomas, 2002: 178). As research on strategic issue diagnosis suggests (Dutton & Duncan, 1987; Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Thomas et al., 1993), managers interpret strategic issues by assessing different aspects of those issues against the categories of their cognitive frames. Individuals with different cognitive frames will attach different labels to information in order to understand it and will interpret information differently (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Weick, Sutcliffe, & Obstfeld, 2005). Accordingly, we expect that decision makers with a business case frame will interpret the ambiguities of sustainability issues differently from decision makers with a paradoxical frame.

Managers commonly interpret strategic issues in terms of two dimensions: sense of control over the issue and valence of the issue—that is, their evaluation of the issue as positive or negative (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Plambeck & Weber, 2010). The perceived sense of control reflects the extent to which a manager believes “in his or her ability to effect a change, in a desired direction” (Greenberger & Strasser, 1986: 165). Sense of control is neither a stable personality trait, since it can change over time and differ according to the issue or situation at hand, nor is it objective (Greenberger & Strasser, 1986). Rather, it represents a subjective perception and may even be an illusion (Langer, 1975). With regard to the valence of an issue, in previous work on strategic issue diagnosis, researchers tended to assume that decision makers usually classify an issue as either positive or negative (Chattopadhyay, Glick, & Huber, 2001; Dutton & Jackson, 1987; George, Chattopadhyay, Sitkin, & Barden, 2006; Jackson & Dutton, 1988; Sharma, 2000; Thomas et al., 1993). More recently, how-

2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 473

ever, organizational scholars have devoted attention to ambivalent interpretations of strategic issues (Fong, 2006; Gilbert, 2006; Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010). While univalent interpretations denote an issue as being clearly positive or negative, ambivalent interpretations attach competing positive and negative evaluations to various aspects of an issue (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010).

We argue that managers’ cognitive frames will play an important role in their perceived sense of control and valence of sustainability issues. Their perceived sense of control depends on what information is available to them (Thomas et al., 1993) and how that information is collected (Das & Teng, 1999). “High levels of information use among top managers will be positively related to their interpretation of strategic issues as controllable” (Thomas et al., 1993: 243). Moreover, the more managers believe they understand cause-and-effect relationships between different aspects of an issue, the higher their sense of control will be (Sharma et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 1993).

With their frame content focused on economic attributes and frame structure based on an alignment logic, managers with a business case frame will have the clear goal of identifying and gaining a detailed understanding of sustainability issues that contribute to economic objectives. Consequently, we expect managers with a business case frame to perceive a high sense of control over the few sustainability issues they have noticed. The sense of control will be heightened by their highly structured and formalized search and assessment routines, which have a clear problem focus (Das & Teng, 1999).

Since they will systematically probe into how sustainability issues relate to financial performance, they will tend to be confident about their ability to understand the nature of this cause-and-effect relationship. As an example, Royal Dutch/Shell managers defended their plans for oil drilling in the Arctic against criticism from environmental NGOs and competitors by highlighting their positive evaluation in terms of business opportunities and their ability to control potential spills. Through a spokesperson, Shell’s top managers argued that “at Shell, we believe the Arctic has significant untapped potential and will play an increasingly important role in meeting the energy challenge” and emphasized their sense of control by stating that “our experience working in rigorous and challenging conditions in the Arctic means that we are qualified to do the job right—to explore for offshore oil and gas in Alaska in a very safe and careful way” (The Guardian, 2012: 35).

Based on “a feeling that no stone has been left unturned” (Thomas et al., 1993: 243), they will have a high sense of mastery and control over sustainability issues.

Decision makers assess issue valence by evaluating those aspects of an issue they have noticed against the categories of their cognitive frame (Petty, Briñol, & DeMarree, 2007). Rudolph and Popp (2007) found that individuals with strong directional goals tend to interpret issues univalently—that is, as either clearly positive or clearly negative. Because of the strong direction decision makers with a paradoxical frame will no-

Decision makers notice a wide range of aspects of a sustainability issue. This broad and inclusive approach will increase their sense of control over sustainability issues, since they believe they will not have missed any important dimension of the problem (Das & Teng, 1999). On the other hand, because of the more complex structure of their frame, decision makers will accept that there are tensions and conflicts between different economic, environmental, and social aspects that can never be fully resolved (Hahn, Pinkse, Preuss, & Figge, in press; Smith & Lewis, 2011). This heightened awareness of conflict will lower their sense of control over the issue (Das & Teng, 1999). Overall, then, we expect decision makers with a paradoxical frame to perceive a moderate sense of control over sustainability issues.

The greater diversity of the paradoxical frame also affects the valence of the evaluation of sustainability issues. “Ambivalent evaluations are likely to arise when executives examine more diverse aspects of an issue, which itself is in part driven by the [cognitive] frameworks employed in the process” (Plambeck & Weber, 2010: 692). Research in environmental psychology (Castro, Garrido, Reis, & Menezes, 2009; Costarelli & Colloca, 2004) shows that the multidimensionality of sustainability issues spurs ambivalent issue interpretations. For instance, domestic waste recycling has been found to simultaneously induce both positive evaluations and negative evaluations—for example, doubts about the overall effect of personal efforts when others do not recycle as well (Castro et al., 2009). With a very low sense of control, decision makers will perceive issues to be beyond their own influence, which will lead them to disengage from the issue and fall back on simpler univalent assessments. With a very high sense of control, decision makers will also evaluate issues univalently because they are overly confident that they can master an issue with existing resources.

routines and fail to consider alternatives (Miller, 1993). Overall, we expect managers with a paradoxical frame, and the resulting moderate sense of control, to experience enough control to handle diverse and competing aspects of an issue, but not enough control to rely excessively on routine evaluations. As a result, such managers will more likely apply distinct and competing positive and negative evaluations simultaneously (see Figure 3).

# Proposition 4b:

The more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to perceive a moderate sense of control over a wide range of sustainability issues and to interpret these issues ambivalently.

Since managerial sensemaking of strategic issues is embedded in an organizational context, organizational identity has been suggested as a critical factor affecting interpretation (Bundy, Shropshire, & Buchholtz, 2013). Organizational identity represents the shared beliefs about the central, distinctive, and enduring features of an organization (Albert & Whetten, 1985). It guides and filters individuals’ interpretation of strategic issues, shaping the meanings given to an issue (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991; Walsh, 1995). Organizational identity defines what aspects decision makers see as positive or negative and what are seen as legitimate interpretations (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991). We therefore expect that the effects of the business case frame and the paradoxical frame on issue valence will be moderated by organizational identity.

A homogeneous identity leads to a single uncontested conceptualization of what is central, distinctive, and enduring about the organization. With its strong self-reinforcing dynamic (Fiol, 2002), a homogeneous identity keeps organizational members focused on organizational goals (Pratt & Foreman, 2000). In the case of a unitary “business” identity (Albert & Whetten, 1985), the “competitive business model in which success is measured in terms of above-market returns and ever-increasing growth rates is more deeply ingrained in . . . beliefs and practices” (Hamilton & Gioia, 2009: 448). Decision makers are primed by such existing routines and are therefore less likely to integrate a diverse set of aspects in their interpretation of strategic issues (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues that include nonbusiness aspects tend to be delegitimized. In contrast, a heterogeneous identity (Gioia, Schultz, & Corley, 2000; Pratt & Foreman, 2000) admits more diverse aspects and, thus, makes ambivalent evaluations more likely (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Organizations with heterogeneous conceptualizations of their central, distinctive, and enduring features accommodate multiple interpretations (Gioia et al., 2000) and tend to have more complex relationships with a wide spectrum of external stakeholders (Brickson, 2005). In such organizations decision makers are more likely to integrate conflicting sustainability aspects in their issue evaluations, because their organization’s identity allows for attending to a wide variety of competing stakeholder demands (Hamilton & Gioia, 2009).

# Proposition 5a:

Decision makers in organizations with a homogeneous business identity are less likely to interpret sustainability issues ambivalently, which will weaken the effects of the paradoxical frame on interpretation.

# Proposition 5b:

Decision makers in organizations with a heterogeneous identity are more likely to interpret sustainability issues ambivalently, which will weaken the effects of the business case frame on interpretation.

Given the role of resource availability as an important contextual factor in strategic issue diagnosis (Dutton & Duncan, 1987), we expect resource constraints to also moderate the influence of cognitive frames on the interpretation of sustainability issues. Resource constraints influence both managerial sense of control and issue valence. In cases where “resources are abundant, decision makers are more likely to feel a sense of control . . . with respect to an issue, than when organizational resources are limited” (Denison, Dutton, Kahn, & Hart, 1996: 459), because they have the means available to deal with the issue adequately (Jackson & Dutton, 1988). In contrast, with limited resources, decision makers feel constrained by their context in the choices they can make and, thus, experience a loss of control (George et al., 2006; Jackson & Dutton, 1988). A lack of resources also makes ambivalent interpretations of strategic issues less likely, since managers tend to lack the time and resources to investi-

gate a greater diversity of aspects of the issue (Plambeck & Weber, 2010).

We expect that resource constraints will particularly influence the interpretation of sustainability issues under a paradoxical frame. Having only a moderate sense of control to start with, decision makers’ sense of control will be further reduced by resource constraints, since these individuals lack time and resources to process the broad range of aspects they perceive. In addition, in times of economic distress, financial aspects are more likely to come to the fore owing to increased shareholder pressure. This will reduce managers’ leeway to consider a wider range of environmental and social aspects that potentially conflict with financial performance. Managers will therefore be forced to take sides and interpret sustainability issues less ambivalently. However, they will feel that this more univalent interpretation is imposed on them rather than being the result of their own reasoning, which will further reduce their sense of control. In contrast, when managers with a business case frame operate under resource constraints, they will still seek univalent interpretations. Resource constraints tend to reinforce their reliance on routine procedures to ascertain the business relevance of sustainability issues in order to maintain control (George et al., 2006). Hence, resource constraints will affect such managers to a lesser degree. They will continue to settle univalently for either positive or negative evaluations, even with a low sense of control (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010). We therefore suggest the following relationship between resource availability and managerial interpretation of sustainability issues (see the dotted curve in Figure 3).

# Proposition 6:

A lack of time and resources will induce decision makers with a paradoxical frame to perceive a lower sense of control over sustainability issues and to interpret sustainability issues more univalently but will not affect the interpretation of decision makers with a business case frame.

# Responding

Once managers have interpreted ambiguous sustainability issues based on their cognitive frame, they will act on that basis. While the cognition of an individual decision maker alone will not determine organizational responses to sustainability issues, we expect that different cognitive frames will lead managers to adopt different decision-making stances. We define stance as a decision maker’s rationalized mental attitude toward an issue, which predisposes the individual to act in certain ways. We argue that the different effects we expect for the two frames with regard to depth and breadth of scanning (Mazutis, 2013) and issue interpretation in terms of sense of control and issue valence (Chattopadhyay et al., 2001; Plambeck & Weber, 2009) will result in different decision-making stances on sustainability issues—that is, either a pragmatic stance or prudent stance. We further characterize these two stances by discussing the scope, novelty, swiftness, and riskiness (Plambeck & Weber, 2009) these different types of responses entail.

As developed above, managers with a business case frame focus in detail on selected aspects of sustainability issues to understand their relevance for economic objectives. Based on focused search routines, they develop a high sense of control over the few sustainability issues they perceive and tend to evaluate these issues univalently as either clearly positive or negative for their business. Consequently, we expect these managers to consider responses that either actively approach an issue—in the case of a positive evaluation—or actively avoid it—in the case of a negative evaluation (Cacioppo, Gardner, & Berntson, 1999). To develop these responses, they refer to existing solutions that have been successfully applied to similarly interpreted issues (Ocasio, 1997): they “access common solutions when faced with common situations that are clearly positive or negative” (Plambeck & Weber, 2009: 998). Being based on incremental adaptations of routine response patterns to positive or negative business issues, the responses these managers consider will be limited in scope. This narrow focus on business routines will enable decision makers to simplify complex sustainability issues (Porac & Rosa, 1996) and to come up with swift responses once they have evaluated an issue as being relevant for economic objectives (Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).

The search for responses to sustainability issues that are in the vicinity of existing solutions also reduces the perceived riskiness and novelty of these responses (Plambeck & Weber,

2014 Hahn, Preuss, Pinkse, and Figge 477

With their high sense of control based on formalized search and assessment routines, as well as existing solutions (George et al., 2006), decision makers with a business case frame tend to underestimate the risk of the responses to sustainability issues that they consider. By relying on established routines to ascertain the profitability of environmental and social investments, such as formal investment appraisal procedures (Epstein & Roy, 2003), and by referring to known solutions, such as incremental improvements of existing technologies (Hart, 1995), they strongly believe in their ability to handle and control risk (Das & Teng, 1999). The higher their sense of control, not only the lower the perceived risk but also the greater the likelihood that risk will be underestimated and the more optimistic the forecasts managers will make about the outcomes of their responses to an issue (Durand, 2003; Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). Consequently, these decision makers will be willing to consider investments of considerable magnitude as long as these do not entail radical departures from established routines but rely on skills and solutions, which they perceive they are able to master.

When responding to regulatory pressure in the European Union for lower carbon emissions during the 2000s, top management of carmaker Volkswagen followed a pragmatic stance and developed the BlueMotion line of more fuel-efficient cars based on incremental improvements of its trusted diesel technology (Financial Times, 2007). This stance, however, came at the expense of developing alternative propulsion systems, such as electric vehicles, that required a departure from existing technologies. At the same time, the BlueMotion line was deployed swiftly across the entire model range, resulting in a large-scale response. Even if this reliance on incremental improvements of conventional technology was probably insufficient to meet more stringent emission regulations in the future, Volkswagen management seemed confident in its focus on responses with limited scope but high controllability (Financial Times, 2011).

Overall, we expect that holding a business case frame will induce a stance on sustainability issues that is characterized by pragmatism. With this stance decision makers prefer “workable” solutions to sustainability issues based on strategies that remain within existing technological systems, producing as little disruption as possible (Prasad & Elmes, 2005). On the one hand, such a stance is rather parochial, since managers only consider responding to those aspects of a sustainability issue for which they perceive immediate business relevance; they will discard other aspects and fail to develop a comprehensive perspective of the issue. On the other hand, their focus on workable solutions is more likely to lead to concrete measures and responses that are actually implemented, thus “proposing working solutions for seemingly insurmountable problems” (Prasad & Elmes, 2005: 850).

Proposition 7a: The more business case oriented their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to adopt a pragmatic stance on sustainability issues.

Building on their broad but less detailed scanning on a wide range of sustainability issues, managers with a paradoxical frame experience a moderate sense of control and develop ambivalent interpretations of sustainability issues that integrate positive as well as negative evaluations with regard to economic, environmental, and social outcomes. This ambivalence simultaneously activates response patterns for approaching positive and avoiding negative aspects (Cacioppo et al., 1999; Plambeck & Weber, 2009). Managers will consider not only environmental and social aspects that provide financial benefits but also aspects where such benefits are unclear, or even unlikely. Their cognitive ability to accommodate conflicting aspects enables them to consider responses with a broader scope that are internally consistent, but “may be inconsistent or contradictory across [responses]” (Smith, Binns, & Tushman, 2010: 449). However, the higher cognitive complexity associated with ambivalence impedes swift responses (Levinthal & Rerup, 2006; Porac & Rosa, 1996), since decision makers take more time to assess and integrate more diverse and potentially competing aspects of a sustainability issue (Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).

Because ambivalence activates a broad set of positive as well as negative evaluations of a sustainability issue simultaneously, managers with a paradoxical frame tend to perceive issues as unique. Consequently, they feel that these issues cannot be adequately addressed through existing solutions and routines, and this

triggers a search for alternative responses (March & Simon, 1958). During the search for alternative responses, the activation of different response patterns increases the “likelihood of finding multiple [yet competing] responses that match the issue” (Plambeck & Weber, 2009: 998). This brings together response repertoires that are usually applied separately—for instance, working with peripheral stakeholders, such as social activists (Hart & Sharma, 2004), while defending established business practices. While decision makers with a paradoxical frame perceive a greater novelty of the responses they consider, their tendency to see sustainability issues as unique problems also heightens the perceived riskiness of their responses (Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993). Managers with a paradoxical frame do not underestimate the riskiness of potential responses because they lack established routines and have only a moderate sense of control. Rather, they accept that there is some uncontrollable risk. To handle risk they avoid taking a stand on the issue too early and keep their options open (Das & Teng, 1999). Thus, while decision makers with a paradoxical frame see the need to consider novel and unusual responses that go beyond existing routines, they are aware of the risk that is associated with such responses. In particular, they are aware that addressing sustainability issues comprehensively entails conflict and undesired side effects. As research in environmental psychology has shown, this awareness of ambivalent effects of more comprehensive responses to sustainability issues lowers the propensity to take concrete action (Castro et al., 2009; Costarelli & Colloca, 2004).

Recent debates on sustainability issues in agribusiness—food security, biodiversity loss, and genetically modified seeds—illustrate the impact of ambivalence on the types of response decision makers consider. For example, Unilever’s sustainability manager recently conveyed an ambivalent position on organic agriculture by emphasizing a reluctance to go fully organic because this would jeopardize food production on the usual scale (NRC, 2013). Yet at the same time Unilever’s upper management pioneered novel sustainable agriculture practices (Whiteman et al., 2013). These have resulted in innovative practices for sustainable agriculture but have had limited business impact, since “it was difficult (at the time) to translate the treatments involving extreme reductions in fertilizers and pesticides into marketable stories” (Pretty et al., 2008: 57–58). Ambivalence on the part of Unilever’s management regarding organic farming led to innovative solutions going beyond using established routines, but these innovations were used on a small scale only.

Overall, we expect that holding a paradoxical frame will induce a stance on sustainability issues that is characterized by prudence. On the one hand, with their comprehensive view on sustainability issues, these managers will see the need to consider responses that break with established routines and business practices in order to achieve environmental and social benefits at the societal level. On the other hand, they will be aware of “the massive uncertainty and unpredictability, nonlinear interaction between system components, unknown thresholds, and complex dynamics in ecological and social systems” (Gladwin et al., 1995: 879) and, hence, tend to approach sustainability issues by moving slowly and carefully (Das & Teng, 1999). Decision makers with a paradoxical frame might even perceive sustainability issues as overly problematic, which would prevent them from envisaging workable solutions and assuming responsibilities for their practical implementation (Kiesler & Sproull, 1982).

# Proposition 7b

The more paradoxical their cognitive frame, the more likely decision makers are to adopt a prudent stance on sustainability issues.

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Our main objective in this article is to develop a cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability. We advance theoretical understanding of the stance managers take on sustainability issues by proposing how two ideal-type cognitive frames, with their differences in content and structure, affect the stages of the sensemaking process of ambiguous issues. In previous research scholars have underlined the importance of managerial cognition and sensemaking of sustainability (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Byrch et al., 2007; Sharma, 2000; Sharma et al., 1999); we add to this literature by offering a more fine-grained understanding of the role individual cognition plays in managerial decision making on corporate sustainability.

ing a wider variety of alternative cognitive frames, we advance research in corporate sustainability, which so far has almost exclusively relied on business case thinking (Bansal, 2005; Gao & Bansal, 2013; Hahn et al., 2010).

As our main contribution, we advance theorizing about managerial decision making on sustainability issues. Building on previous work on the role of interpretation of sustainability issues in explaining strategic choice (Sharma, 2000), we uncover the effects of differences in cognitive frames on the underlying sensemaking process that links cognition with a manager’s decision-making stance. This cognitive framing perspective on corporate sustainability connects to a number of key aspects of the debate on managerial interpretations of and responses to sustainability issues. For instance, while the strategic management literature has recently drawn attention to the role of ambivalent issue interpretations (Plambeck & Weber, 2009, 2010), the corresponding debate in the sustainability literature has remained within an opportunity/threat dichotomy (Andersson & Bateman, 2000; Sharma, 2000). We advance this field of research not only by introducing ambivalent managerial interpretations of sustainability issues but also by elaborating on the cognitive determinants of univalent and ambivalent interpretations. In previous research on the antecedents of managers’ ambivalent interpretation of strategic issues, scholars have focused on organizational factors (Plambeck & Weber, 2010). Our cognitive framing perspective adds individual-level factors to the picture. While Barr, Stimpert, and Huff (1992) found that decision makers’ cognitive frames link cues from the organizational context to managerial decision making, we explain how differences in the content and structure of a manager’s frame act at the different stages of the sensemaking process.

As another important implication, we add to research on the different types of responses managers consider with regard to sustainability issues. In this context, a manager’s sense of control and perception of risk have been discussed as key determinants of the choice of different responses (George et al., 2006; Thomas et al., 1993) and of associated decision-making biases (Das & Teng, 1999; Kiesler & Sproull, 1982). Our analysis of the effects of differences in frame content and frame structure sheds new light on the sometimes contradictory implications that have resulted from the application of different theoretical lenses to managerial risk and perceptions of control (Chattopadhyay et al., 2001; George et al., 2006). We suggest that with different cognitive frames managers’ sense of control over an issue may stem from fundamentally different sources. Likewise, we expect managers to perceive and deal with the riskiness of potential responses differently, depending on which of the two frames they hold. These cognitively determined differences have important implications for managerial decision making on ambiguous sustainability issues. The pragmatic and prudent stances that we expect to be associated with the business case frame and the paradoxical frame, respectively, suggest that commonly used classifications of issue responses along general classifications, such as the reactive, defensive, accommodative, and proactive (RDAP) scale (Clarkson, 1995; Wartick & Cochran, 1985), may be too simplistic. Managers with a pragmatic stance favor responses of limited scope based on established routines and practices, which considerably limits their proactiveness, yet their propensity to develop workable solutions can potentially bring about large-scale change. Managers with a prudent stance may consider unusual and more radical departures from established routines, yet they are hampered in their ability to implement workable solutions because of their ambivalence and higher awareness of risk and tensions. The often-bemoaned reluctance of firms and their managers to address in a radical fashion the immense challenges that sustainability presents (Whiteman et al., 2013) may thus be rooted in the cognitive predispositions and limitations inherent in both frames. Owing to their pragmatic stance, managers with a business case frame rarely consider deviating from established routines but rely instead on incrementalism; paradoxically minded managers may well see the need to consider bolder responses to sustainability issues but shy away from such endeavors since they are hampered by ambivalence and prudence.

This argument highlights the need to address the interplay of the two cognitive types, since both business case and paradoxical frames have their role to play in bringing about change but may operate at different stages. Because they go beyond a focus on economic attributes alone, the relatively few managers with a more

paradoxical frame might act as pioneers to pro- propose comprehensive responses that depart from existing routines. However, the translation of these responses into practice may well require managers with a more business case– oriented frame, who are cognitively predisposed to re- ducing the complexity of sustainability issues to a level that enables the implementation of these novel practices at a large scale. Neither of the two frames alone will be sufficient to bring about managerial responses that measure up to the immense challenges sustainability presents.

The interplay of different cognitive types has various practical and theoretical implications. With regard to managerial practice, in the nascent field of sustainable human resource management (Ehnert, 2009), the composition of teams of different cognitive types may play an important role in the management of sustainability issues. Mirroring findings on the combination of different cognitive styles in the composition of successful innovation teams (Miron-Spektor, Erez, & Naveh, 2011), teams dominated by either business case–minded or paradoxical types may be less successful in implementing innovative responses to sustainability challenges than mixed teams. By avoiding a strong bias in such teams toward one of the two cognitive types, firms can make sure they remain aware of the complexity of sustainability issues (due to the presence of paradoxical types) without losing sight of the need to implement workable solutions (due to the presence of business case types).

Our argument also has theoretical implications for the growing body of literature on hybrid organizations. While this literature conceptualizes conflicting financial and social goals in terms of competing institutional logics (Battilana & Dorado, 2010; Pache & Santos, 2013), our focus on the interplay of different cognitive types highlights the relevance of individual-level factors when organizations face competing demands. Our argument suggests that the presence of decision makers who accept competing financial, environmental, and social objectives through paradoxical thinking (Smith, Gonin, & Besharov, 2013) might not be sufficient. Rather, the coexistence and the interplay of different cognitive types, where some are aware of tensions but others are not, appear to play a critical role not only for the management of corporate sustainability in for-profit firms but also for the successful implementation of hybrid business models.

Finally, we believe that addressing a greater cognitive diversity of managers promises considerable further insights into the nature and contingencies of managerial responses to issues other than sustainability that are also characterized by conflicting yet interrelated aspects and where the debate is also dominated by a business case perspective. For instance, diversity in organizations represents a complex issue that scholars and managers alike often frame as having business value (Herring, 2009; Robinson & Dechant, 1997). Here, too, business benefits are unclear (Cox & Blake, 1991), and critical voices call for approaches that go beyond business case thinking (O’Leary & Weath- ington, 2006). We expect that considering alter- native frames on such an issue will shed new light on how and why decision makers approach diversity issues in different ways.

We propose two ideal-type cognitive frames through which individuals make sense of sus- tainability issues, based on different views on how economic, environmental, and social di- mensions relate to each other, a key debate in corporate sustainability (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). However, we acknowledge that frames can be based on various rationales (Zietsma & Vertinsky, 1999). Cognitive perspectives that cor- respond to other debates within the corporate sustainability literature will result in alterna- tive ideal-type frames and promise further in- sights into the effects of frame content and struc- ture on managerial responses to sustainability issues. While not being exhaustive, Table 2 of- fers a starting point for exploring such alterna- tive frames. One set of frames may form around governance issues, exploring the question of who is responsible for taking action to address sustainability concerns—for example, private sector versus state (Matten & Crane, 2005; Rein- hardt, Stavins, & Vietor, 2008). Other frame sets could relate to the discussion of different moti- vations to take action on sustainability—for ex- ample, altruism versus (enlightened) self- interest (Bansal & Roth, 2000; Jensen, 2001)— or could address the different time dimensions that are being discussed in the sustainability litera- ture—for example, present generations versus future generations (Held, 2001; Slawinski & Bansal, 2012).

We contribute to the discussion of alternative cognitive frames by going beyond a descriptive typology (Zietsma & Vertinsky, 1999) to address in detail the effects of differences in frame content and structure. However, we do not suggest that any particular frame automatically determines the sensemaking of decision makers. Rather, we expect that the effects of managers’ cognitive frames on their decision making will be moderated by a range of personal, situational, and contextual factors. We propose that the effects of the two frames on scanning and interpretation will be attenuated by the functional background of managers and by organizational identity, respectively. In addition, our argument on the availability of resources illustrates that not all frames are susceptible to contextual factors. Some cognitive constraints, as in the case of narrow scanning by business case–minded decision makers, cannot be simply overcome by providing abundant resources, whereas in other instances—for example, with the sense of control of paradoxically minded managers—resource constraints prevail over cognitive predispositions. The moderators we propose provide only an initial step toward understanding the various factors that influence the role of cognitive frames. We are aware that there are further relevant moderating factors, beyond the individual- and the organizational-level factors we address, providing ample opportunities for future research into a cognitive framing perspective on managerial sensemaking of ambiguous issues. It would be particularly fruitful to address the moderating role of institutional factors since these prime and trigger cognitive frames (Weber & Glynn, 2006). Future research could thus investigate how multiple, competing institutional logics (Besharov & Smith, 2014; Jay, 2013) moderate the effect of cognitive frames on sustainability decision making.

Another relevant question for future research refers to the origin of cognitive frames. Since managers’ frames “do not spring up randomly, but rather are the encoding of their prior history” (Kaplan & Tripsas, 2008: 791), we would expect that a range of factors at personal, organizational, and institutional levels will influence the formation of cognitive content and structure. With regard to personal background, researchers have argued that personality traits, such as need for closure (Webster & Kruglanski, 1994) and tolerance for ambiguity (Furnham & Ribchester, 1995), play an important role in sensemaking under conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity (McKenzie, Woolf, van Winkelen, & Morgan, 2009). With regard to the organization as a context for managerial decision making (Gioia & Thomas, 1996; Weick, 1979), the influence of organizational structure on managers’ cognition (Hannaway, 1985) may differ between centralized and decentralized organizations (Pugh et al., 1963). Moreover, since managers’ cognitive frames are shaped by the particular institutional fields they have been exposed to (Weber & Glynn, 2006), dominant and contested institutional logics (Purdy & Gray, 2009; Reay & Hinings, 2009) may prime different cues and privilege certain frames over others (Weber & Glynn, 2006). Future research into the antecedents of the business case frame and the paradoxical frame will help us to understand who the managers are that are more likely to adopt a pragmatic or a prudent stance on sustainability issues.

Our focus on cognition at the individual level raises the question of how different cognitive frames and the resulting decision-making.

stances relate to organizational action (Dutton & Jackson, 1987; Thomas et al., 1993). We see at least two key aspects at the interface between individual cognition and organizational action that merit further investigation: the activation of frames and the dominance of frames. A better understanding of the factors that trigger a stronger or weaker activation of the two frames promises relevant insights. Such factors may be found within the organization—for instance, in an organizational climate of participation (Tesluk, Vance, & Mathieu, 1999) and creativity (Ekvall, 1996)— or outside the organization—in major regulative, technological, or economic discontinuities (Griffith, 1999; Tushman, Newman, & Romanelli, 1986). Moreover, since managerial cognition is a social process within an organizational context (Daft & Weick, 1984), individual frames will only translate into organizational action when they are transformed “into the organization’s predominant collective frames” (Kaplan, 2008: 730). Collective cognitive frames are the outcome of a political process where organizational members compete over the dominant interpretation of an issue (Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991). Future research could address the factors that enable decision makers to translate their own cognitive frame into the dominant collective frame. Overall, further development of the cognitive framing perspective may result in a more comprehensive theory that establishes a connection among individual history, cognition, and agency.

We believe that our cognitive framing perspective and our propositions provide ample opportunities for future empirical studies. Given the nascent state of research into tensions and cognitive diversity in sustainability, scholars may find it most fruitful to use both quantitative and qualitative methods (Edmondson & McManus, 2007). However, testing our propositions through quantitative research presupposes the development of measurement scales for the business case frame and the paradoxical frame. To gain insights into the cognitive processes of decision makers who use business case frames or paradoxical frames, (semi-)qualitative methods, such as interviews, content analyses, and exploratory case studies, will be particularly suitable (Grégoire, Barr, & Shepherd, 2010; Lüscher & Lewis, 2008).

In conclusion, we believe that a cognitive framing perspective offers a better understanding of managerial decision making on sustainability issues by recognizing the importance of a greater cognitive diversity of managers with regard to the content and structure of their frames. Our goal in this research, therefore, has not been to advocate a specific cognitive frame but, rather, to pave the way for the consideration of different cognitive perspectives on complex and ambiguous issues, such as corporate sustainability.

# Abstract

Green shared vision (GSV) has provided a research prototype for past green management research topics; however, few studies have examined the confusion related to environmental issues among employees. Therefore, to fill the aforementioned research gap, this study used psychological ownership theory and expectancy–valence theory to establish a research framework for GSV. This study explored the relationships of GSV with employee green confusion (EGC) and employee environmental performance (EEP) as well as the mediating effect of green product psychological ownership (GPPO) on these relationships. The research results indicate that GSV positively affects GPPO, EGC, and EEP. Moreover, GSV also influences behavior and performance through personal psychological processes. Thus, if an enterprise wishes to establish GSV, it must adopt a series of supporting measures, including improving members’ GPPO, to effectively reduce EGC and improve EEP to realize the goal of sustainable development.

# 1. Introduction

Corporate strategies worldwide are affected by environmental management issues [1]. When enterprises support environmental protection and actively participate in environmental management, they not only pursue corporate values but also improve their image by complying with environmental regulations [2]. Enterprises should embrace the philosophy of sustainability with a creative mind in this environmentalistic age [3, 4]. In general, shared visions are developed at the organizational, group, or individual levels to generate motivation for achieving transformation from a present status to a desirable end status [5]. When the organizational planner has a strong vision, the sustainable development of a company is promoted [6]. Obtaining a better understanding of the driving forces behind the phenomena might help new companies to integrate resources and enhance their corporate performance [7]. A corporate shared vision is a key factor affecting the competitive advantage of a corporation over other entities. Currently, sustainable development has become an important issue worldwide. The pursuit and achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) has become a trend for companies. Therefore, corporate sustainability has become a major topic.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

Corporate sustainability refers to decreasing the waste of natural resources (especially nonrenewable resources) to zero during enterprise operational activities to reduce the damage caused by corporate activities on society or the environment [8]. Corporate sustainability has become an indispensable strategy for many companies today [9 – 11]. Such strategies are gradually being integrated into company activities and culture, whether with respect to the corporate system (including operations), strategies, organizational systems, or stakeholders (internal and external as well as social and environmental) [12]. Corporate sustainability has become the basis of sustainable success [13]. When employees and organizations have different values, implementing a developed sustainability plan is difficult [14]. Employees are the core resource of an enterprise [15]. Employees play an important role in maintaining the competitive advantage of an organization. They also determine the performance of the organization [16]. A company’s ability to achieve a competitive advantage is related to its ability to employ excellent talent [17].

Given the aforementioned information, employees play an important role when designing sustainable development strategies for an enterprise. The occurrence of employee green confusion (EGC) cannot be ruled out when employees promote green shared vision (GSV). However, studies on green confusion have not focused on the views of an enterprise’s employees. Most of these studies have examined consumer orientation and have focused on the effects of greenwash on consumers, such as the effects of greenwash on green consumer confusion and green trust [18] as well as environmental and product perceptions [19]. Thus, employee orientation related to confusion in the field of corporate sustainability has been rarely discussed. To fill this research gap, the present study proposes a new concept called EGC. This study refers to the definition of Chen and Chang [18] to define EGC as the confusion of employees regarding the environmental characteristics of company products or services. The present study developed an integral framework of employee environmental performance (EEP). It also investigated the relationships of GSV with EGC and EEP as well as the mediating effects of green product psychological ownership (GPPO) on these relationships. Environmentalism is an important corporate issue today, and EEP is critical to corporate sustainability. This research enables a better understanding of the effects of a shared vision and various types of integration on corporate management.

Studies have rarely used a theoretical basis to explore the effect of organizational members’ psychological processes on the organization’s environmental management performance [1, 20 – 26]. This study investigated the effect of GSV on GPPO, EGC, and EEP by focusing on company staff and using psychological ownership (PO) theory and expected price theory. We used the obtained findings to fill the research gap on EGC issues in corporate sustainability research. This study proposes a comprehensive conceptual structure to explore the effect of company members’ psychological processes regarding the company’s green issues on the company’s green management performance.

# 2. Literature Review and Hypothesis Development

# 2.1. Negative Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Employee Green Confusion (EGC)

Given the global trend of concern for environmental issues, existing strict environmental regulations, and customers’ perception of the environment, companies must develop suitable legal strategies to gain valuable resources [27, 28]. A collective strategic direction can be encapsulated in a shared vision, which guides company members’ actions according to a certain approach [29]. A shared vision can also be used to encourage corporate employees to exhibit excellent performance [30]. A shared vision is a key aspect of strategic management for a company because it indicates the unique objective, general direction, and practices of the company [31]. The method used by an organization to develop a shared vision has become the primary focus of environmental management research. The concept of GSV is defined on the basis of environmental friendliness and sustainable development [24]. Managers establish clear and common environmental goals for future organizational development, which enables the organization to supervise the green behavior and performance of employees as well as minimize EGC.

Staff confusion may occur when a company provides excessively similar, excessively complex, or an excessive amount of product or service information regarding SDGs. The larger the amount of information processed by an individual, the higher is their likelihood of experiencing information overload [32]. Information overload creates confusion [33], and EGC may affect a company’s SDGs. This research refers to the definition of EGC provided by Chen and Chang [18], who stated that EGC refers to employees’ inability to correctly understand the environmental characteristics of their company’s products and services as well as the characteristics of its environmental policy during information processing. Therefore, companies must formulate a clear green common vision and effectively obtain employee recognition to encourage the green behavior and performance of employees [24, 34, 35]. GSV can encourage the green behavior and performance of employees, effectively develop employee recognition, and eliminate EGC. GSV is negatively related to EGC. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:

Hypothesis 1 (H1). GSV is negatively associated with EGC.

# 2.2. Positive Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)

Currently, many companies are facing challenges caused by the rise of global environmental awareness, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and increasing consumer environmental awareness. To ensure that valuable resources are obtained legally, an organization must formulate a suitable legal strategy [27, 28]. A carefully planned and designed company vision facilitates employees’ actions and decisions and inspires them to move toward a shared vision [36]. A shared vision is a common future goal set by an organization’s manager for the development of the organization. It conveys the norms and beliefs of the company to members. A shared vision can motivate employees to perform [30] and exceed expectations related to their work performance [34].

When an organization proactively performs environmental actions, its long-term goals with respect to corporate greening are conveyed to its staff [37]. Environmental improvement performance depends on whether a shared vision exists between staff and managers, especially when environmental strategies require intensive staff engagement [38]. Above all, the process of combining corporate environmental performance and strategy is profoundly affected by the shared vision [39]. A shared vision can reduce the adverse effects caused by senior team members setting different goals and having conflicting views [40, 41]. Moreover, such a vision can prevent the fragmentation of a team.

Team members must establish a shared vision, and continual interaction, practice, and reflection can improve team performance [42]. With regard to EEP, organization managers can influence green purchasing behavior [43], promote environmental market-oriented strategies [44], and encourage

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

employees to have a responsible attitude toward environmental issues [ 45 ]. Organizations should always encourage members who possess good intentions, especially those who adopt a responsible attitude toward environmental issues. This step would enable employees to perform responsible actions when environmental problems arise.

Employees play an important role in promoting green management in an enterprise. Paillé and Meija-Morelos [ 46 ] defined EEP as the performance of employees’ compliance with company norms, and their interaction and communication based on personal environmental knowledge to relevant stakeholders. Expectancy–valence theory is a cognitive motivation theory that connects the energy of an individual’s motivation or willingness to strive for goals and expectations and obtain the expected value of the incentives to a specific purpose [47].

According to expectancy–valence theory, the choice, performance, and continuity of organization members’ achievement behaviors are affected by expectations and values [48], which results in individuals investing increased efforts to obtain expected values [49 ]. When a company develops a suitable GSV, the GSV motivates employees to strive for goals and values that contribute to employee behavior. Related research has indicated that a shared vision is crucial for enhancing employee environmental behavior [24,34,35,50]. Consequently, the following hypothesis is proposed:

# Hypothesis 2 (H2). GSV is positively associated with EEP.

# 2.3. Effects of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)

Psychological Ownership (PO) refers to the relationship between a person and an object that is closely connected with the self [ 51 ]. The concept of ownership is partially based on the research of consumer behavior regarding the extended self and possession [ 52 ,53 ]. Isaacs [ 54 ] indicated that the thoughts in a person’s mind become a part of them. For an individual, when property is accepted in the mind, it becomes “mine” [55]. Legal ownership can provide an opportunity for individuals to assimilate themselves into a company and become part of it, which can enhance the emergence of ownership as a mental status [56]. Because ownership connects possessors to targets, when employees link work with emotion, their connection with the work becomes closer. Furthermore, positive attitudes and thoughts are generated to further promote work performance [57 ]. Ownership is a mental status experienced by humans in which people consider themselves to own a target (nonmaterial or material in nature) completely or partially [ 58]. According to Pierce et al. [58 ], PO refers to a personal sense of possession held by an individual for an immaterial or material object (“this is mine!”). Due to PO, an individual is willing to take responsibility or sacrifice for their organization [59].

For the sustainable development of an enterprise, the degree of PO of company members for their company’s green products affects their behavior and attitude as well as the company’s green management performance. GPPO occurs when a company member has a psychological sense of ownership for the company’s green products, treats the products as subject matter, generates positive attitudes and thoughts, and is willing to engage in off-role behavior and take risks for this behavior such as dedication and sacrifice [ 35 ]. Therefore, for companies that are moving toward sustainable development, the degree of GPPO affects employees’ behavior, attitudes, and organizational green management performance. Furthermore, when a company employee has strong GPPO, they would exhibit a positive attitude and positive ideas, be willing to take risks for the company, and make additional efforts and sacrifices [35].

# 2.3.1. Positive Effects of Green Shared Vision (GSV) on Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)

Personal PO in organizations mainly originates from the four motivations of human needs: (1) Efficacy and effectance, (2) self-identity, (3) having a place, and (4) stimulation. Of these motivations, stimulation needs are incentives for PO. Efficacy and effectance indicate that individuals can successfully

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

exercise control and appear to have a sense of ownership, which is used as a source of attaining satisfaction. Self-Identity represents the personal experience of biasing the subject matter, and as a part of self-extension, the most important thing is to own. Such holdings symbolize a kind of identity and are interpreted by others. Having a place refers to the need for personal space, which motivates individuals to control their surroundings and invest in them. Stimulation drives individuals to use, care about, and maintain objects. Thus, people are motivated to achieve stimulating needs and meet awakening requirements [58–61].

Many factors influence the formation of PO. These factors influence not only the formation of PO and work characteristics but also the company culture, attitude of high-level managers, company’s goals and vision, and reputation of the company [62]. A common vision conveys an organization’s members’ common goals and ambitions for the organization [29, 63]. Moreover, it represents the organization’s vision, mission, and core values [64, 65]. Thus, when a company promotes sustainable development and formulates a GSV, this expresses to employees the goal and value of their efforts and strengthens their personal ownership and PO of the target green product. Chiu et al. [62] proposed that a company’s goals and vision affect PO. Moreover, according to Chang [35], GSV contributes to GPPO. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 3 (H3).

GSV is positively associated with GPPO.

# 2.3.2. Effect of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO) on Employee Green Confusion (EGC) and Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)

PO affects individuals’ attitudes, motivations, and behaviors. Furthermore, PO causes a person to exhibit a stance, sense of responsibility, and self-concept beyond the norms [66]. When an organization’s members have PO for their organization, they tend to exhibit more responsibility for their roles, take greater care of the organization, and adopt a protective attitude toward the organization [67]. Moreover, they may be willing to take risks or make personal sacrifices for the organization [59] and the subject matter of PO [59]. When members of an organization have PO for a certain subject matter, they may exhibit positive attitudes toward the organization [68]. Research has indicated that PO is an important predictor of the status of members of organizations [56, 58, 66, 69, 70]. Studies have indicated that factors such as the work performance and satisfaction of work can be predicted by organization-based PO [58, 59, 71, 72].

The PO of green products can predict individuals’ organizational citizenship behavior for the environment [35]. When PO is assigned to a certain subject matter, employees tend to regard it as a social entity, be psychologically related to it, be willing to take risks for it, and generate positive attitudes and behaviors toward it. In general, according to PO theory, GPPO refers to the PO generated by employees of a company for its green products when they regard the products as a subject matter. GPPO enables a company’s employees to exhibit positive attitudes and behaviors, and this contributes to organizational performance and encourages employees to actively search for information regarding company products, services, and related environmental policies that they did not understand initially. To maintain GPPO, employees become more willing to follow relevant environmental regulations and practices. Therefore, this study proposes the following hypotheses:

# Hypothesis 4 (H4).

GPPO is negatively associated with EGC.

# Hypothesis 5 (H5).

GPPO is positively associated with EEP.

# 2.3.3. Mediating Effects of Green Product Psychological Ownership (GPPO)

PO differs according to the motivation for possession. The feeling of possession is ubiquitous. Possession can be a tangible goal, an intangible goal, or a statutory but not legal form of ownership [73].

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

When the inner and psychological feelings possessed by an individual are integrated, and the members of the organization will be based on human instinct motivation, they may feel such ownership due to various factors in the organization and practice to further satisfy. In particular, when the target slowly becomes a part of the owner’s psychological identification, PO is generated [58].

According to PO theory, an individual’s PO of a certain subject matter originates from four demand motivations that include (1) efficacy and effectance, (2) self-identity, (3) having a place, and (4) stimulation [58 –61]. The psychological history of PO as well as the personal positive behaviors and attitudes are based on interpretations of the subject of PO. According to the theoretical perspective of expectation motivation, an individual’s positive performance and contribution are related to the desire to meet expectations [48, 49]. Consequently, when the underlying motivation of an individual’s PO meets the expected value, the individual would exhibit a highly positive behavior and attitude. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:

# Hypothesis 6a (H6a).

The relationship between the exposure to EGC and GSV is mediated by GPPO.

# Hypothesis 6b (H6b).

The relationship between the exposure to EEP and GSV is mediated by GPPO.

# 2.4. Negative Effects of Employee Green Confusion (EGC) on Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)

Companies are facing considerable pressure from relevant stakeholders, such as customers, business partners, and environmental organizations, to focus their policies on the environment [74] and develop, produce, and sell environmentally friendly products. Companies intending to achieve the goal of sustainable development may do well to formulate a GSV to promote all aspects of relevant environmental protection measures to create a green image of themselves [75 – 79]. Employees may experience information overload when an enterprise manager releases excessive information regarding the enterprise’s environmental regulations, products, or services to quickly respond to requests from relevant stakeholders, such as customers, environmental organizations, and governments.

Mitchell, Walsh, and Yamin [32] indicated that people exhibit different levels of information cognition and digestion when they process information. When the amount of information increases, the likelihood of information overload also increases. The release of a large amount of information can cause confusion among employees [32, 33] as well as make it difficult for employees to focus on the relevant environmental regulations promoted by the company and to interactively exchange environmental knowledge with relevant stakeholders. The aforementioned phenomenon of employee confusion is called EGC. When EGC occurs, employees’ interactions with their organization’s relevant norms and stakeholders are affected. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:

# Hypothesis 7 (H7).

EGC is negatively associated with EEP.

The research framework is illustrated in Figure 2.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

# Employee Green Confusion (EGC)

# Green Shared Vision (GSV)

# Psychological Ownership (GPPO)

# Employee Environmental Performance (EEP)

# 3. Methodology and Measurement

# 3.1. Data Collection and Sample

To verify the aforementioned hypotheses in the Taiwan production industry, a questionnaire survey was conducted. The study participants were staff members who worked in the information services, electronics, components manufacturing, computer and peripheral products, health care and biotech, communication equipment manufacturing, electronic products and components, equipment and machinery manufacturing, and software industries in Taiwan. The questionnaire survey sample was randomly selected from the “Business Directory of Taiwan.” The participants were leaders or managers of the manufacturing, research and development, environment, or marketing departments or members of environmental product development projects. To ensure a high degree of content validity in this research, two rounds of pretests were conducted.

Respondents from different industries and sectors were recruited in this study because such recruitment reduces common method variance problems. To effectively improve the response rate, reliability, and validity of the questionnaire, before the questionnaire was issued, we contacted the relevant companies by phone to determine whether they provided green products or related services and confirmed whether green products were their primary revenue source. We provided gifts to the respondents after they filled the questionnaire. On the first page of the questionnaire, the research objectives were explained, and informed consent was requested from the participants. The participants were then informed that the green products or related services provided by their company were the evaluation targets of the company’s GSV, EGC, EEP, and GPPO. We issued 750 formal questionnaires and obtained 475 valid questionnaires. Thus, the effective response rate was 63.33%. In this study, in order to effectively reduce the possible factors that MacKenzie and Podsakoff [80] pointed out that are likely to cause CMV, we can hide the respondent information, the design purpose of the item, and randomly sort the items when designing the questionnaire. Furthermore, as suggested by Cacioppo and Petty [81], the semantics and words used in the design of the questionnaire are closer to the background of respondents. This can improve the entire questionnaire design, and we can survey people in different industries or units. Afterwards, the CMV test was conducted through Harman’s one-factor test. The result indicated that the load of the first factor was 28.319%, which met the standard value below 50%. As a result, there was no serious CMV problem.

# 3.2. Measurements

This research framework questionnaire contains four measurement dimensions (the scale presented in Appendix A), including GSV [25], GPPO [35], EGC [18,82], and EEP [46], using a 7-point Likert scale. While this research questionnaire refers to the scale developed by related scholars, there may still be research biases. This research is further verified through exploratory factor analysis, principal component analysis, and orthogonal rotation with varimax. The verification result shows that Bartlett’s test of sphericity and the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) value all as stated by standard value [83] is suitable for exploratory factor analysis, with 17 items and 4 components. The component names are the same as the original construct, namely GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP (Table 1). Nunnally and Bernstein [84] suggested that the standard value of correlation coefficient (Cronbach’s α) should be more than 0.7 and each aspect meets the standard value. Consequently, the questionnaire of this research has good reliability.

The loadings (λ) of all the items of the four constructs are presented in Table 3. All the loadings were significant and exhibited suitable values in the measurement mode. The Cronbach’s α can be used as an index for determining the reliability (the standard value is 0.7) [85]. We verified the Cronbach’s α values according to the recommendations of researchers such as Williams and Hazer [86] and Anderson and Gerbing [87]. The Cronbach’s α values of all the constructs were more than 0.7, as presented in Table 4. Therefore, the measurement reliability is consistent with an acceptable standard value.

According to Fornell and Larcker [88], when the square root of the average variation extracted (AVE) of the facet is greater than the correlation coefficient of the model facet, it means that each variable has discriminative validity, as shown in Table 2. The AVE square roots of the models GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP in this study are greater than the correlation coefficient of all the constructs. Thus, sufficient discriminant validity existed between any two constructs in this research.

Henseler, Ringle, and Sarstedt [89] pointed out that the effect of the original Fornell and Larcker [88] discriminant validity test may be overestimated. Hence, this study further uses average heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) to calculate the correlation ratio between the four facets of EEP, EGC, GSV, and GPPO. The overall result shows that it meets the standard value (all less than 0.85), so this study has good discriminative validity (see Table 4). A construct’s convergent validity is acceptable if its AVE is greater than 0.5. The AVEs of GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP were 0.688, 0.726, 0.736, and 0.628, respectively, which are greater than 0.5. Thus, the constructs considered in this study had suitable convergent validity. Besides, Bagozzi and Yi [90] pointed out that the R-square of the observation variable is >0.5, which means that each observation variable is suitable for measuring each potential variable (Table 3). The aforementioned results indicated that the measurements in this study had acceptable validity and reliability.

# 4.2. Structural Model Results

The analysis of moment structure and structural equation modeling were performed to test the research hypotheses. The structural modeling results are presented in Figure 3. According to the results, the full model had an acceptable fit (NFI = 0.951, CFI = 0.968, GFI = 0.928, and RMSEA = 0.061). GSV exhibited direct effects on EGC (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = −0.504), EEP (p &lt; 0.01, standardized direct effect = 0.148; Figure 3), and GPPO (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = 0.426). GPPO exhibited direct effects on EGC (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = −0.37) and EEP (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = 0.452). Moreover, EGC exhibited a direct effect on EEP (p &lt; 0.001, standardized direct effect = −0.307). The study results indicated that H1, H3, H4, H5, and H7 were supported. Thus, GSV has a direct and positive effect on GPPO, EGC, and EEP. GPPO has a direct and significant relationship with EGC and EEP, and EGC has a direct effect on EEP. According to Baron and Kenny [91], who verified the mediating effects, GPPO partially mediates the relationships of GSV with EGC and EEP.

Figure 3. Full model results.

To ensure preciseness, we performed a percentile bootstrap procedure and a deviation correction percentile bootstrap procedure 5000 times with a 95% confidence interval to examine two mediating models [92]. According to the advice of Preacher and Hayes [93], we calculated the confidence interval of the upper and lower bounds to verify whether the indirect effects were significant. The bootstrap test results presented in Table 5 indicated that GPPO partially mediated the relationship between GSV and EGC (standard indirect effect = −0.145, Z = 4.394, p &lt; 0.001; 0 was not included in the 95% confidence interval) and between GSV and EEP (standard indirect effect = 0.141, Z = 4.7, p &lt; 0.001; 0 was not included in the 95% confidence interval). Thus, hypotheses 6a and 6b were confirmed. After exploring the indirect effects of the variables of the structural model, we further examined the obtained data and found two unexpected intermediary relationships: (1) the mediation effect of EGC on the relationship between GSV and EEP (standard indirect effect = 0.113, Z = 2.216, Z &gt; 1.96; 0 is not included in the 95% confidence interval) and (2) the distal mediation effects: GSV and EEP via GPPO and EGC (standard indirect effect = 0.145, Z = 1.986, Z &gt; 1.96; 0 was not included in the 95% confidence interval).

# 5. Conclusions and Implications

In this study, we investigated Taiwanese companies that engage in environmental protection. We examined the effect of psychological processes related to green issues on employees’ green management performance. This study verified the relationships among GSV, EEP, GPPO, and EGC through PO theory and expectancy–valence theory. By investigating GSV and the PO of green products, we came to understand the effect of psychological processes related to green issues. Green management performance is enhanced by reducing EGC and improving EEP.

The study results indicate the existence of associations in the concept of integration. For example, the psychological processes related to green issues affect EGC and EEP. In addition, this study indicates that the antecedents of PO strengthen the PO effect as well as the behaviors and attitudes of the parties. The combined insights obtained from PO theory and expected value theory can contribute to sustainable environmental development. The results indicate that GSV has a significant negative correlation with EGC and a significant positive correlation with EEP. Thus, developing a GSV for an enterprise is an important strategy for the enterprise to achieve sustainable development. GSV can strengthen the PO.

# 5.1. Theoretical Implications

Our research provides three academic contributions to the sustainable development of green management in the field of psychology. First, the empirical results verified the hypothesis that expectancy–valence theory incorporates PO. When results meet people’s expectations, they receive additional investment and compensation, strengthening the PO’s degree [49, 94]. The aforementioned contribution expands the original expected value theory to fields such as topic teaching and learning for young children [94–97], unemployment issues [47, 98], and physical and mental health issues [99], which enables research gaps in the field of business management to be filled. Moreover, few studies have examined confusion issues from the perspective of employees. Therefore, this study used the views of PO theory and expectancy–valence theory to establish a research framework for GSV to fill an existing research gap. Second, the empirical results of the past GSV research literature found that GSV contributes to employee’s proenvironmental behavior [100], green product development performance [34, 101, 102], and organizational citizenship behavior for the environment [35], especially focusing on employee behavior and product development performance. Finally, the study results indicate the effect of psychological process related to green issues on green management performance in an integrated conceptual framework. The expectation value theory and PO theory indicate that relationships exist among GSV, GPPO, EGC, and EEP. This finding expands the contribution of psychology to sustainable environmental development. This study also verified PO theory by examining the mediation effects of EGC and EEP on the relationship between GPPO and GSV. The results indicated that GSV enhances the degree of PO and positively affects GPPO. The research model expands the PO model and indicates that GSV is crucial for the formation of PO, reduces a company’s EGC, and improves a company’s EEP. Thus, GPPO is critical for corporate sustainability [35, 103].

# 5.2. Practical Implications

The research findings can help Taiwanese companies promote environmental sustainability. These findings also provide a reference to other Asian companies seeking to perform green management. The research results indicate that a relationship exists between GSV and GPPO in psychological processes related to green issues. Moreover, the results indicate that an organization’s green management performance is affected by its EGC and EEP. This study indicates that EGC and EEP are caused by GSV and GPPO. GSV is positively correlated with EEP, GPPO is negatively correlated with EGC and positively correlated with EEP, and EGC is negatively correlated with EEP. The aforementioned results indicate that psychological processes related to green issues improve an organization’s green management performance. We found that employees’ EEP is affected by their EGC. Therefore, this study proposes several steps for corporate management to reduce EGC and promote EEP. First, the head of the enterprise management class should formulate a GSV, express the goals and aspirations of the company’s sustainable development, and regularly discuss and reflect on the amendments to the GSV. The development of a shared vision for the organization would improve organizational performance and motivate members to work toward organizational goal [29, 42, 63, 104, 105]. Thus, companies should use psychological processes related to green issues for verifying the execution results and adopt an active GSV strategy to create employee GPPO in their business models. By using the aforementioned strategy, companies can reduce employees’ EGC and improve their EEP. In particular, companies should formulate an environmental development blueprint and develop incentive plans to encourage their employees to participate in the design and production of environmental products. A good practice is for employees to participate in the production process of environmentally friendly.

# 5.3. Limitations and Future Research

This study has certain limitations. First, the data analysis results unexpectedly revealed that EGC has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between GSV and EEP. The findings of this study provide preliminary concepts that should be verified using relevant studies. Second, this study analyzes the perspectives of expected value theory and psychological ownership theory and discusses the environmental behavior and performance of organizational employees. Future research can go further and use other theories. For example, the value theory can further strengthen the relationship between Psychological Processes of Green Issues and Green Management Performance through the exploration of Costs and benefits or the expectancy theory. Third, all the research participants were from Taiwan. The universality of the study results may be limited by differences in the national conditions, cultures, industrial scenarios, and economic structures between different countries. Therefore, the results of this study can be verified by conducting research in other countries and regions, such as Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. Finally, from the perspective of the company’s internal green management strategy, this study verifies that the psychological processes of company members related to green issues affect their GSV and GPPO. We also analyzed members’ environmental behavior and performance as well as excluding other behaviors and organizational characteristics that may disturb employees. In future research, we will be able to further explore the perceived organization’s support to the environment and the organization’s impact on the environment’s citizenship behavior [46]. Or, according to Chen, Chang, and Lin [24], starting from the green absorptive capacity of employees, further discuss the issues and determinants that affect employees’ environmental behavior and performance.

# 5.4. Conclusions

According to expectancy–valence theory, the psychological process related to green issues affect the background factors controlling the influence of GSV on company members. This study combined insights from PO theory and expectancy–valence theory and presented a psychological process structure. Due to the research gap related to the association between GSV and green management scope, this paper presents a framework that emphasizes how GSV affects the relationship between EGC and EEP through GPPO in the current environmental era. This research explored an extramental mechanism that illustrated the connection between GPPO and relevant variables. The research model indicates that EGC and EEP are affected by the exposure to GSV through an increase in GPPO. A Taiwanese employee sample was used to support the proposed hypotheses. This study provides many important

Sustainability 2020, 12, 10514

implications for guiding managers and decision-making authorities. According to the integrated model of the psychological process of green issues in this study, the assumptions of expected value theory and psychological ownership theory indicate the psychological process of employees’ motivation and psychological ownership. The overall process of an enterprise to effectively strengthen employees’ mentality of green issues is an important key to improving the organization’s green management performance. In the process of improving EEP, companies must not only strengthen the psychological process of employees’ green issues, but reducing EGC is also an important key. Effectively reducing EGC can enable employees to devote themselves to work and contribute to EEP. Therefore, companies should upgrade their GSV to enhance their employees’ GPPO and EEP and decrease their employees’ EGC to achieve corporate sustainability goals.

# Corporate sustainability disclosure’s importance in China: financial analysts’ perception

# Jhunru Zhang, Hadrian Geri Djajadikerta and Terri Trireksani

# Abstract

Purpose – Corporate sustainability in China has become a subject of increasing international concern. Corporate sustainability disclosure (CSD) is considered a useful tool to facilitate the empowerment and acknowledgement of stakeholders in the quest for sustainability. However, the degree of cultural and political influences for being sustainably orientated can be significantly different between countries. This study aims to examine the perception of financial analysts, as CSD report users, in China about the level of importance of various indicators of corporate sustainability described in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.

Design/methodology/approach – A set of questionnaires was developed based on GRI G4 guidelines to measure the perception of financial analysts in China on the level of importance of each sustainability indicator described in the GRI G4. A five-point Likert scale was used to measure the report users’ perceptions of each of the indicators.

Findings – The findings of this study increase our understanding of how Chinese CSD report users perceive corporate sustainability differently from the GRI guidelines. The main results show that the environmental aspect of sustainability was seen to be important in China, followed by the social and economic aspects. Indicator-wise, “water”, “effluents and waste”, “emissions”, “compliance” and “energy” were perceived as vital in the environmental category, while “customer health and safety”, “customer privacy” and “compliance” were considered significant in the social category.

Originality/value – This study addresses the need for differing corporate sustainability guidelines for different nations and cultures, specifically within the Chinese context. It also contributes to the corporate sustainability literature by adding to our understanding of how financial analysts in China, as CSD report users, perceive aspects of sustainability.

# 1. Introduction

While the economic development of China over the preceding decades has led to significant improvement in its national prosperity, it has also generated a considerable degree of concern about corporate sustainability. Corporate sustainability disclosures (CSD) are generally considered to be the most effective and efficient way for companies to facilitate the empowerment and acknowledgement of company stakeholders’ quest for sustainability and to inform the society about their sustainability performance (Qian et al., 2015). Because of the lack of comprehensive and effectively enforced CSD regulations, the growth of corporate sustainability practices in China extensively depends on voluntary disclosure practice (Zhang et al., 2015).

However, as Received 21 October 2018 Revised 8 July 2019 Accepted 14 July 2019 DOI 10.1108/SRJ-10-2018-0272 © Emerald Publishing Limited, ISSN 1747-1117 jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j

Recognised the importance of issuing corporate sustainability reports because of the severe environmental deterioration and significant social issues raised in tandem with the boost of the Chinese economy.

For example, the serious milk powder corporate scandals in mainland China have raised extreme concern regarding companies’ social responsibility: in 2008, Sanlu Group added melamine into the formula of milk powder to boost the protein content. Infants who consumed this product were highly likely to develop kidney stones or even an illness that was fatal if seriously affected. Sanlu Group was one of the largest milk powder manufacturers and sellers in China for over 15 continuous years, and it was once the biggest taxpayer. The revelation of the scandal caused the failure and bankruptcy of Sanlu, and, more importantly, it destroyed people’s confidence in the Chinese milk powder supply industry. The 300,000 victims triggered considerable social pressure, which consequently affected thousands of workers, causing them to lose their jobs (Nornha et al., 2013). Society, as a result, had to bear this significant social cost.

As such, the unique context in China provides a significant setting to examine CSD perception from its users’ end. The local Chinese community, in general, has relatively high societal acceptance towards CSD information. Under the Confucius perspective, maximising shareholders’ value and financial profit should not be the only goal of making corporations sustainable (Liu and Anbumozhi, 2009). Xia et al. (2009) emphasised the idea of righteousness before profits and stated that the fundamental value of ethics should reflect the business values. Hence, concerns and actions should always be closely related to all of the customers’, employees’ and shareholders’ values, and sustainability information is in favour for the general community as Confucian culture has been embedded in the basis of modern corporate sustainability in Chinese companies (Zhu and Yao, 2008).

In addition, Chinese enterprises are increasingly pressured by numerous stakeholders and by the general public to engage in social and environmental sustainability. In particular, in China, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) have made a great effort to promote corporate governance initiatives in past years. Ho (2013) indicates that the rapid growth of these markets is significantly influenced by two essential pieces of legislation: the Company Law and the Securities Law, enacted in 1993 and 1998, respectively. The Company Law provides the legal requirement for the transformation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into private or listed enterprises. To conform to the two legislations, the stock exchanges in China have implemented guidelines for their listed corporations to take responsibility for their stakeholders. The SZSE issued the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Guidelines for Listed Companies in 2006 and the SSE issued similar guidelines in 2008, and both stock exchanges begin to mandate CSR reporting in a subset of listed companies. However, the guidelines provide limited assistance to companies preparing for their disclosures. The lack of a prescribed reporting framework is, therefore, ambiguous and has led to large variations in reporting practice, such that users find the reports challenging to compare and use for decision-making (Zhang et al., 2015). In addition, sustainability information can be used for window-addressing and causes heterogeneous expectation among investors. The subsequent noise increases stock price volatility and decreases firm values (Orlitzky, 2013). Given the local community in China is in favour for CSD information, particularly under the sustainability promotional strategy by the state government, CSD reporting companies are likely to be inadequately guided by the existent guidelines and generating information that increases the dispersion of the market expectation. However, limited research has examined what is expected from primary stakeholders and how the reporting companies should address such expectations. As such, in this study, we focus on financial analysts’ perceived importance of CSD in the unique institutional setting of China.

# 2. Literature review and hypotheses development

# 2.1 The context of sustainability reporting in China

Sustainability reporting, which is also referred to as CSR reporting, focused solely on social issues at its very beginning stage in the early 1960s (Lin, 2010). Elkington (1994) suggested that there are six stages of CSD development, which include ignorance, awakening, denial, guilt reduction, displacement behaviour and tokenism, conversion and finally, integration. This was further extended and re-summarised by Dunphy et al. (2003). They developed more sophisticated concepts for each of the six stages of CSD development, which include rejection, non-responsiveness, compliance, efficiency, strategic proactivity and the sustaining corporation.

After the emergence of triple bottom line reporting, the number of companies that issued CSD increased, with different names to show different areas of focus. Reynolds and Yuthas (2008) explained this early stage of reporting sustainability as companies owing the duty to the society in which they are bonded with a social contract.

According to Freeman (1984), sustainability reporting is an approach for a company to identify its socially relevant behaviour, determine those to whom the company is accountable for its environmental and social performance and develop appropriate measures and reporting techniques. However, being sustainable or ecologically responsible is defined differently across cultures (Hofstede, 1980).

In China, CSD is mostly perceived to be a response to external government and public pressures on corporate management (Gao, 2009). The notion of corporate sustainability reporting was first proposed in 2006 in the amendment of the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China, Article 5 of the General Law. Later in 2006, in the Chinese Communist Party Sixth Plenary Session, a national plan proposal was made to create a harmonious Chinese society with a focus on being socially responsible, particularly for business enterprises (Gao, 2010).

As a response to the national plan, the SSE and SZSE issued social reporting guidelines in 2006 and 2008, respectively, to create an appropriate system for corporate sustainability reporting. According to the SSE guidelines Notice for Better Reporting 2008 Annual Reports, a subset of industries that were listed in the Chinese financial market, including the SSE corporate governance sector, firms with shares listed overseas and financial companies, were mandated to prepare CSR reports alongside the annual reports. However, despite the introductions of a number of policies after the two stock exchange markets announced their guidelines, the meaning and definition of corporate sustainability were never specified. The guidelines also did not provide any indication of how to prepare and what to include in a CSD. While the CSR guidelines in China have initiated systematics rule and approaches to report CSR, the coverage and the specificity of the reports are still less comprehensive than those formulated in the Western context (Nornha et al., 2013).

The board indications from the CSR guidelines in China are provided below:

“Listed companies are encouraged to disclose non-financial information in CSR reports.

Non-financial information should be based on the triple bottom line namely, economic, social and environmental information.

CSR reports should be endorsed by the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee.

Areas and circumstances in which listed companies should compulsorily disclose environmental information are indicated.

A new concept of social contribution value per share (SCVPS), a ratio used to measure the listed companies.” (Nornha et al., 2013, p. 32)

As suggested further by Nornha et al. (2013), the reporting companies could choose their own methods to calculate the related ratio under the guidelines, which was subjective and challenging for companies to follow. While the concept of corporate sustainability has become more commonly accepted in China, there has been no agreed-upon definition of it. Therefore, the standardisation and the regulations of corporate sustainability in China are in a great need of development (Bai et al., 2015).

# 2.2 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines in China

In China, the GRI (2013) guidelines are used as the basis of most sustainability reportings. In recent decades, GRI has attempted to provide comprehensive guidelines for CSD by setting indicators in corporate economic, environmental and social sustainability (Chauvey et al., 2015). Firms that adopt GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines need to report their strategy in the company profiles, explain their management approach as to how they address corporate sustainability practices and disclose their company sustainability (economic, environmental and social) performance (Hahn and Lulfs, 2013). GRI, overall, provides companies with information on how and what to report in CSD.

While GRI provides such comprehensive sets of guidelines on CSR, it ultimately aims to enhance companies’ information transparency and overall accountability. This has elevated the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to become the most commonly used framework internationally (Hahn and Lulfs, 2013). The KPMG Questionnaire into CSR (KPMG, 2008) examined the top 250 companies listed on the Fortune Global 500 and the 100 largest firms by revenue in 22 countries. The results showed that more than 75 per cent of companies from the Fortune Global 500 and 70 per cent of the 100 largest revenue firms applied the GRI. GRI is also considered practical for firms to use as report preparers are able to self-examine their own level of corporate sustainability performance.

As suggested by Brown et al. (2009), GRI is significant in terms of its “broad range of stakeholders” approach, as well as institutionalising multi-stakeholders on reporting and accountability. However, Drori et al. (2006) indicated that GRI is mostly presented by multinational companies on a global basis and international accounting firms have large influence on standardising the guidelines. Western multinational firms, therefore, help to set the agenda on corporate sustainability reporting based on their own interests (Vigneau et al., 2015). It is suggested that “the guidelines’ lack of universal applicability creates a perceived unfairness inherent in imposing Western standards of social behaviour and associated reporting practices” (Adams and McNicholas, 2007, p. 484).

Nevertheless, GRI remains highly authoritative globally because of its context, language, concepts and assumptions (Brown et al., 2009). It has a significant role to highlight the importance of corporate sustainability reporting and has led to new practices of corporate sustainability and responsibility (Vigneau et al., 2015). Hopkins (2004) also contends that the GRI guidelines include some aspects of the other popular environmental and social guidelines, such as the ISO 14000 and the global Sullivan principles.

# 2.3 Perceptions and motivations of sustainability in China

Early studies on the topic of perception of CSR in the Chinese context have broadly discussed the differential impact to measure CSR based on the Western and the Chinese definitions. Both Western and Chinese literature indicates that corporate sustainability is, to some degree, directly related to shareholders and companies values, as well as the need for the companies to be legitimate and ethical. Cultural differences have also created some different perceptions about corporate sustainability in the West and the East. Many studies, which were conducted in China, into Chinese culture and corporate sustainability, have explored the idea of profits from righteousness (Yi) principle, derived from Confucius.

Another stream of studies on CSR perception in China is generally focused on the potential of political interference and government intervention, and it examines the disclosure content to reveal the propensity for firms to report on government policies (Gao, 2011; Kuo et al., 2012; Li and Zhang, 2010; Marquis and Qian, 2014). Kuo et al. (2012), based on a content analysis of Chinese data obtained from CSR reports, found that environmental sensitivity and ownership structures distinguish corporate environmental disclosures. Sensitive industries and government-owned firms are found to be more committed to providing environmental disclosures than less-sensitive industries and non-government-owned firms. They were also highly engaged in energy saving, carbon reduction, research and application of new techniques – beneficial activities that assist China in dealing with the global warming issue. Kuo et al.’s (2012) study also suggested that the Chinese government has an important role in promoting corporate CSR engagement.

Marquis and Qian (2014) examined corporate strategic response to government signals through CSR disclosure. They examined 1,600 listed firms between 2006 and 2009, and their results supported the findings of Kuo et al. (2012) that the Chinese government’s signalling is a critical driver for corporate reporting, particularly for the SOEs that exert substantial political influence. Further, they found that the reporting companies are highly subjective to decoupling risk under specific monitoring mechanism. The expectation of policymakers drove the reported CSR practices.

Gao (2011) found that the listed companies in the Chinese financial market had, overall, a positive attitude to engage in CSR. Specifically, they found that SOEs have a higher tendency to engage in social issues through CSR than the non-SOEs. Gao (2011) suggested that political promotion on the ideology of CSR has important meanings for SOEs’ CSR engagement. Further, industrial firms were also found to have higher propensities on CSR than service industries.

Through a discussion of the interplay of the global and national societal pressures in China, Hofman et al. (2017) suggested that CSR practices by Chinese firms are highly “state-led” and “local-driven”. They discussed the multiplexity of the business system and its impact on the CSR concepts in the Chinese context. In particular, they examined the “authorisation capitalism” within the family owned small and medium firms, which suggested that the CSR engagement in these types of firms was oriented to local concern and driven by the local community’s perception of the CSR.

# 2.3.1 Users’ perceived importance of corporate sustainability disclosure in China

While existing literature in Chinese CSR has focused more on SOEs, there are also some limited studies that explore CSR practices at non-SOEs. Kuo et al. (2015), for example, suggested that there were no significant differences between environmental disclosure at SOEs and those at the privately owned enterprises. Based on an evaluation of 781 CSR reports between 2008 and 2010, they found the higher disclosure quality in CO2 and SO2 emission was predominantly because of the government-led national strategy; however, other social activities were better reported by privately owned firms.

From the theoretical point of view, signalling theory has been getting attention in corporate disclosure studies in recent years, because it assumes that people send and explain signals to reduce information asymmetry (Lin, 2010). The theory considers that information asymmetry typically exists in a capital market. Under this assumption, information obtained from the management level is considered as much more accurate and reliable than information obtained from the market (Shan and Taylor, 2014). Therefore, investors seek information transparency through corporate sustainability information; without it, they cannot respond quickly to make rational decisions about the most effective investment (Shan and Taylor, 2014). It is also assumed that CSD could lower companies’ capital costs (Li et al., 2013) as well as increase sales (Creyer, 1997), market share and brand value (Schaltegger and Burritt, 2005), because firms with a higher degree of sustainability engagement have.

higher propensity to outperform the non-sustainability performing firms (Dhaliwal et al., 2011).

Companies that disclose non-financial information signal their willingness to communicate with their stakeholders about sustainability issues that are unknown by the market (Yang, 2011), and companies produce stand-alone reports when the benefit of providing such disclosure outweighs the related costs. Companies with sound performance will deliver their positive image to the public and be distinguished examples among their peers.

The users of CSD, in general, include a broad range of company stakeholders, such as socially conscious customers, employees, non-governmental organisations, regulators, investors and financial analysts (Cordeiro and Tewari, 2015). In the context of China, signalling theory is relevant for evaluating the users’ perception of CSD in China because most of the ordinary companies in China have no experience and are not willing to disclose voluntary sustainability information (Shan and Taylor, 2014). However, they have increasingly received significant pressure from the public, the government and industrial associations, to disclose.

For companies that have produced sustainability reports, and those that plan to do so, it is still not clear which sustainability indicators are considered important to disclose by the report users in China. Only if users perceive a strong and significant relationship between relevant indicators in sustainability reports and long-term corporate performance, they will find the data in the reports as useful. Therefore, understanding users’ perceived importance of CSD is essential.

This provides motivations to us to assess the level of importance of the CSD in China from the users’ perspective. Considering that GRI guidelines are mostly used in China for sustainability reporting, in this study, we use sustainability indicators listed on the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines to evaluate users’ perceived importance of each of the indicators. Respondents in this study are asked to rate their perceived importance of each indicator using a five-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being “very unimportant”, 2 being “unimportant”, 3 being “neutral”, 4 being “important” and 5 being “very important”. The data are accordingly analysed to reflect the users’ perceived level of importance of the corporate environmental, economic and social information disclosures.

# 2.3.2 Chinese report users’ perspective on Global Reporting Initiative’s sustainability indicators.

While GRI guidelines are used as the basis of most sustainability reporting, there have been some concerns regarding the potentially different perceptions of the level of importance of the indicators listed on the GRI guidelines. Wang and Juslin (2009), for example, based on their literature study on terms of differences between the West and East contexts, claim that Western corporate sustainability concepts do not adapt well to the Chinese market, because they have rarely defined the primary reason for corporate sustainability. The ethic approach to the corporate sustainability concept does not take the Chinese reality and culture into consideration. They point out that corporate sustainability is a term that may be legitimately interpreted within the Chinese corporate culture. However, Confucianism and Taoism, which emphasise the “cultivation of virtue and morality, as well

as the core of its harmony notion” (Wang and Juslin, 2009, p. 446), offer a better understanding of corporate sustainability within the Chinese context. Accordingly, there may be some of the indicators listed on GRI guidelines that are not relevant within the Chinese context, and hence, they are not considered as necessary by the Chinese report users. This study tries to evaluate whether it is indeed some differences in the way Chinese report users’ perceived level of importance of sustainability information indicators listed in the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines than what are intended by the GRI by including the indicators in the GRI guidelines.

In this study, we use a Likert scale of 4 being “important” as the basis GRI score for each of the GRI indicators and compare it with the respondents’ mean values for each of the relevant indicators. A t-test is used to determine if there is any significant difference between two sets of scores, which indicates whether Chinese report users perceive the level of importance of sustainability information in GRI guidelines differently from what are intended by the GRI.

# 3. Hypotheses

Thus, the following set of hypotheses is proposed:

- H2. CSD users in China perceive the level of importance of sustainability information in GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines differently from what are intended by the GRI.
- H2A. CSD users in China perceive the importance of environmental information indicators in GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines differently from what are intended by the GRI.
- H2B. CSD users in China perceive the importance of economic information indicators in GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines differently from what are intended by the GRI.
- H2C. CSD users in China perceive the importance of social information indicators in GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines differently from what are intended by the GRI.

# 3.1 Methodology

# Questionnaire design

Billings and Halstead (2005) suggested that one of the best ways to obtain information about beliefs, behaviours, views and perceptions of individuals in the business world is to ask questions with closed ends. In this study, a Web-based questionnaire was designed based on sustainability indicators listed on the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. The scale of GRI has been validated by Chow and Chen (2012), in which corporate sustainability construct was modelled in social, environmental and economic dimensions.

To verify the measurement scale, they adopted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis in structural equation modelling and confirmed the validity of the proposed GRI model. While Chow and Chen (2012) address the partial concerns of the validity of GRI from the preparer’s end, their results are limited to interpret the perception from the report users. According to Brown and Deegan (1998), materiality within the sustainability report is used to be the way of potential organisational financial risks by address concerns from various stakeholders. It is imperative to consider corporate sustainability also from the report users’ perception.

In our data collection, each respondent was asked to rate their perceived importance of each indicator using a five-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being “very unimportant”, 2 being “unimportant”, 3 being “neutral”, 4 being “important” and 5 being “very important”. A five-point Likert scale was used because the scale is considered suitable to provide sufficient discrimination for most purposes and can be easily understood by respondents (Brace, 2004).

jSOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL j

As the questionnaire was designed based on the structure of GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, there were 11 questions about environmental disclosure, 4 questions about economic disclosure and 28 questions about social disclosure. The questions were translated into Chinese with the assistance of professional translators. To ensure the accuracy of the translation, we wrote emails to the first 30 respondents who left their contact details at the end in our pilot study. We asked about their understanding of our questionnaires with the Chinese version of GRI attached. Overall the respondents found the questionnaires are well written, and we decided to continue the full sample data collection. Discrepancies, reliability and validity were studied and tested in a pilot test, which involved 30 financial analysts from China. Appropriate adjustments were made to suit the terms used in China and the local dialect and expressions in the language.

# 3.2 Sample data

In this study, financial analysts were used as the target respondents as corporate sustainability information has always been one of the valuable inputs for financial analysts to evaluate and to predict firm value (Lin, 2010). Lin (2010) suggested that financial analysts are experts who assess corporate policies and performance on various issues of sustainability in China and that financial analysts are considered to be the prime CSD users who influence other investors extensively. A good corporate sustainability reputation captured by financial analysts could improve companies’ brand value and reputation, which in turn could enhance the appeal of firm’s products to consumers (Brown and Dacin, 1997) and lead to increased sales (Dhaliwal, et al., 2012).

Our sample responses were obtained in 2015, a time when President Xi initiated his leadership in China by imposing a higher degree of national sustainable development through the National Congress and the National Plan (Zhang et al., 2018). Our target respondents were the financial analysts who worked at securities organisations that were registered on the China Securities Regulatory Commission (www.csrc.gov.cn). To approach the financial analysts as our study’s respondents, we sent an email to 200 financial managers who worked at these registered security companies. Their contact information was obtained online. Each manager was also asked to distribute our Web-based survey URL to their financial analysts. We received 129 usable responses. Table I shows the demographic information of the respondents of the survey.

# 3.3 Data analysis

In this study, we build on and extend the work of Chow and Chen (2012). Chow and Chen (2012) have indicated the validity of the scale by GRI from the report preparers’ end. We did a validity test by applying the EFA to explore the perceived importance of corporate sustainability reporting from the report users’ perceptive. EFA is commonly used for interpreting self-reporting questionnaires which have been widely used in existing perception and motivation-based CSR research (Dincer and Dincer, 2012; Firmialy and Nainggolan, 2018; Hayton et al., 2004; Latif et al., 2018; Sheng and Chen, 2010). We performed EFA because it reduces a large number of reflective and latent measures into a smaller set (Hair et al., 1995); hence, it confirms the dimensions defined by the GRI and fosters our hypotheses testing in the later part of the study. EFA also provides the significance of validity for the construct under the GRI based on our questionnaires (Hayton et al., 2004).

To test our hypotheses, we adopted t-tests to confirm the level of importance based on our questionnaire results. t-tests are commonly used to determine if there is any significant difference between two sets of scores. A one-sample t-test is often considered when only a single sample of the participants and the questions are used to determine whether the

The mean of the population from which the sample is drawn is the same as the hypothesised mean (Hair et al., 1995). In this study, one-sample t-test was adopted because the mean value drawn from the users’ perceived importance of each type of sustainability disclosure was compared with the level of importance intended by GRI (i.e. the value of 4 as per the Likert scale used).

# 4. Results and analysis

# 4.1 Exploratory factor analysis

Based on the definition of the sustainability items from GRI, we prepared reflective indicators in the questionnaires in terms of environmental indicators, economic indicators, social indicators – labour and decent work, social indicators – human rights, social indicators – society and social indicators – product responsibility. The estimation of the EFA results is presented in Table II. Unsurprisingly, EFA reveals six underlying dimensions, which are consistent with the sustainability definition by GRI. We follow the similar approach of Latif et al. (2018) in the critical assumption of EFA. Firstly, our correlation matrix shows that all items were significant at p < 0.001 level. Interestingly, we detect that “environment grievance” in the environmental indicator construct has a relatively low factor loading of 0.134. One explanation is that there were limited ways of environmental grievance in the Chinese context because of the lack of government monitoring controls over corporate environmental performance (Chen et al., 2017). Additionally, our result also suggests the suitability of factors with Bartlett’s test of sphericity (x² = 3698.805, df = 946 and p < 0.01) that measures the probability of the correlation matrix with other components, where the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure is 0.849 at 0.01 significance level. Lastly, we accounted for 51.885 per cent of the variation in our data based on the six factors yielded from the scales based on EFA. We further performed a reliability test, in which our Cronbach’s alphas are substantially above the critical value of 0.7. Based on the results from EFA, our results overall show sufficient convergent validity in each construct, which allows us to perform the following t-tests for hypothesis testing.

# 4.2 Perceived importance of the environmental indicators

Table III presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for environmental indicators, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. Five indicators are found to be statistically significant at 0.01 level: “water”, “effluents and waste”, “emissions”, “compliance” and “energy” with mean values of 4.51, 4.48, 4.46, 4.35 and 4.20, respectively. The results suggest that CSD report users in China perceived these five indicators more important than what were intended by the GRI. The t-test for the other seven indicators shows no significant results. For “effluents and waste”, “emissions” and “compliance”, the perceptions of the respondents were consistent with the recent trend of carbon offsets and carbon emissions.

in many major cities in China, which has gradually gained significant international attention. Carbon offset refers to a monetary investment that abates greenhouse gas emission or sequesters carbon from the atmosphere, which is used to compensate for greenhouse gas emission from companies’ own activities. To combat severe air pollution, Beijing, for example, has had “APEC-blue” sky, because the government temporarily shut down the industrial area in Hebei. The overall mean value for environmental indicators is 4.20 (out of 5). Hence, H1A was supported, and the overall t-test result partly supported H2A.

# 4.3 Perceived importance of the economic indicators

Table IV presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for economic indicators, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. “indirect economic impacts” and “procurement practices” are found to be statistically significant at the 0.01 level, while “market presence” is found to be significant at the 0.05 level. The t-test for “economic performance” shows no significant result. Interestingly, the mean values for all four indicators are below the test value of 4, suggesting that all economic indicators were not perceived to be as important as they were intended to be in the GRI guidelines. The overall mean value for economic indicators is 3.79 (out of 5). Hence, both H1B and H2B were not supported.

and “Diversity and equal opportunity” are found to be statistically significant at 0.05 level, but their mean values are less than the t-test value, meaning that they are considered less important. The t-test for the other three indicators shows no significant results. The overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of labour practice and decent work is 3.98 (out of 5), which is very close to the test value of 4.

# 4.4.2 Social indicators – human rights

Table VI presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for social indicators in the sub-category of human rights, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. Nine out of the ten human rights indicators are found to be statistically significant at either the 0.05 or 0.01 level. However, the mean values show that some indicators are considered more important, while the others are considered less important. With regards to indicators that were perceived as more important than what were intended by GRI, “child labour” and “security practice” obtained higher mean values than the t-test value of 4. In contrast, “non-discrimination”, “freedom of association and collective bargaining”, “indigenous rights”, “investment”, “human rights grievance mechanisms”, “assessment” and “supplier human rights assessment” are perceived as less important by the CSD report users in China than they were intended to be by GRI. The t-test for “forced or compulsory labour” shows no significant result. The overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of human rights is 3.89 (out of 5), which is quite close to the test value of 4.

# 4.4.3 Social indicators – society

Table VII presents the mean values and the results from the t-test for social indicators in the sub-category of society, sorted by their mean values from the highest to the lowest. “Compliance” is found to be statistically significant at 0.01 level and it has a mean value of 4.16, indicating that the CSD report users in China perceived this indicator as more important than what was intended by the GRI. In contrast, “anti-competitive behaviour”, “public policy”, “local community” and “supplier assessment for impacts on society” are found to be statistically significant at either 0.01 or 0.1 level, but their mean values are less than the t-test value, meaning that they are considered less important. The t-test for the other two indicators shows no significant results. The overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of society is 3.91 (out of 5), which is quite close to the test value of 4.

Note: t-test at 95% confidence interval; significant at 0.05 level; significant at 0.01 level

Responsibility indicators are found to be statistically significant at either the 0.01 or 0.05 level. The mean values show that three indicators are considered more important, while one indicator is considered less important. “Customer health and safety”, “customer privacy” and “compliance” are found to be statistically significant at 0.01 level with mean values of 4.36, 4.31 and 4.25, respectively. These indicate that the CSD report users in China perceived this indicator as more important than what was intended by the GRI. On the other hand, “marketing communication” is found to be statistically significant at 0.05 level, but its mean value is less than the t-test value, meaning that it is considered less important. The t-test for “Product and service labelling” shows no significant result.

The overall mean value for social indicators in the sub-category of society is 4.17 (out of 5), which is higher than the test value of 4.

# 4.4.5 Overall social indicators

The overall mean value for social indicators is 3.96 (out of 5), which is very close to the t-test value of 4. Hence, H1C can be considered as supported, and the overall t-test result partly supported H2C, with various detailed results for the indicators.

# 4.5 Overall perceived importance of the sustainability disclosure

The overall mean value for all indicators of sustainability disclosure is 4.10 (out of 5), which is higher than the t-test value of 4. Hence, H1 is supported, and the overall t-test result partly supported H2, with various detailed results for the indicators.

# 5. Discussion

In general, our findings of the users’ perceived importance of CSD indicate that the importance of CSD perceived by the report users in China was partially different from what was intended by GRI. The degrees of difference varied across disclosure categories. Our findings show evidence that there are moderate differences in the Chinese report users’.

perceived importance of environmental, economic and social disclosures from what were intended by the GRI. Environmental disclosure, with an overall mean value of 4.20 (out of 5), was perceived as more important by the users than what was intended by the GRI. Social disclosure, with an overall mean value of 3.96 (out of 5) can be considered as having the same level of importance by the users as what was intended by the GRI and, lastly, economic disclosure with a mean value of 3.79 (out of 5), was perceived as less important by the users than what was intended by the GRI.

As shown in Table IX, our results overall show consistency with the existing literature in the context, whereas partial differences are apparent comparing with Western individualistic contexts. Looking closer, environmental indicators that received a high level of perceived importance often relate to the most publicly concerning issues, such as energy, water, emission, effluents and waste in environmental disclosure in China. The results are consistent with literature both in China and Western countries. Lu and Abeysekera (2017) and Chow and Chen (2012) both used Chinese data and found that effluents and waste, emission, compliance and energy are significant from report preparers’ end. In our case, as the data were collected in 2014, a series of promotion on the corporate sustainability development was fostered by President Xi because of the change in leadership. While there is no mandatory requirement on corporate sustainability reporting, environmental control such as carbon emission reduction and energy saving have been incorporated in the National Plan and have been continuously promoted in the national Congress Zhang et al. (2018). This can also be influenced by the 12th Five Year Sustainability Plan by the Chinese government, in which companies were encouraged to disclose use of material, energy consumption and general environmental performance. Although adherence to the plan is on a voluntary basis, seemingly users wanted to see information regarding these areas being disclosed in annual and sustainability reports.

With regard to social disclosure, it is notable that “product responsibility” indicators generally received a high level of perceived importance. Product responsibility is another area of concern in China, because of prior severe food product faults and the milk powder scandal in the community. In comparison with existing research (Chow and Chen, 2012; Lu and Abeysekera, 2017), product safety on customer health was broadly found as an essential factor perceived by report preparers. It is evident that the concerns and the fear of product safety in China are far from resolved. While other social items (e.g. occupational health and safety, employment, security practice, indigenous rights, investment and compliance) also show high consistency with prior literature, the majority of the social related sustainability information was not perceived importantly because of their exclusion from regulations and the voluntary nature in the Western context (Amaral and La Rovere, 2003; Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; Chow and Chen, 2012; Erol et al., 2009; Hussey et al., 2001; Lindgreen et al., 2009; Lu and Abeysekera, 2017).

Economic disclosure was perceived as less important in comparison with the other two types of disclosures. Information included in economic disclosure presents a measurement of the economic outcomes of a company and the effect and relevance of these outcomes on a broad range of stakeholders. As most of the economic disclosure can be obtained from the annual reports, it may be considered less relevant within the context of sustainability reporting, in comparison with the other two types of disclosures. However, economic disclosures were perceived to be much more important in the Western settings (Amaral and La Rovere, 2003; Baumgartner and Ebner, 2010; Erol et al., 2009; Hussey et al., 2001; Lindgreen et al., 2009; Murillo-Luna et al., 2008; Rueda-Manzanares et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2007). This is consistent without discussion in Section 2.1 that the Western context considers sustainability as a way to stretch the wealth creation, thereby producing the long-term sustainable economic performance (Zhang et al., 2018). In our results, we detected negative associations, which indicate that economic information is considered less attractive because the disclosures may have been released in financial reports.

# 6. Conclusion

This study provides some evidence of the Chinese report users’ perceptions on the importance of GRI indicators of sustainability disclosure. Because of the unique cultural and political background that influence companies in China, our results offer significant

relevance to existing research into China’s corporate sustainability or social responsibility practices and reporting mechanisms. We found that the Chinese concerns on corporate sustainability are partially different from the Western context-based literature, as well as that from the GRI. The national pursuit of sustainability development engaged by the government has an inevitable influence to change and lead corporate stakeholders’ perception of corporate sustainability. The government as a dominance among social actors has a substantial impact on societal acceptance towards corporates, which has gradually embedded in the Chinese culture. We urge future research to consider the political, cultural and policy impact on society’s expectation when analysing the scope and the extent of corporate sustainability reporting in the Chinese context, especially when comparing results again the Western-based studies.

Our study is subjected to the following limitations. Firstly, this study has limited the collection of its data from financial analysts in China who are considered as prime CSD users. It is suggested that future research may include other relevant report users to further enhance the findings. Secondly, respondents’ perceptions may change over time, and hence a follow-up survey may be necessary to measure the response in a long-run. Thirdly, the differences in the perceived importance of CSD in different countries is possible to be linked with the levels of their development. Because of the political system in China, corporate stakeholders’ perceptions may be considerably influenced by state government. Hence, it could be important for future research to address this concern by including multi-national perceptions for comparisons.

# Abstract

The purpose of this study is to analyze the connection between the sustainability performance and financial performance of Bangladeshi banks to explore the impact of the Bangladesh Environmental Risk Management Guideline. We analyzed all 56 scheduled commercial banks that are currently operating in Bangladesh under the guidelines of the Central Bank of Bangladesh. Data for the sample has been collected from publicly available reports such as annual, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, disclosed sustainability and financial information on the banks’ websites, including all bank branches, and data published from the Central Bank. Data has been analyzed using panel regression. Our results indicate that higher sustainability performance creates a higher financial performance, and that bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks. The analysis did not find, however, that higher financial performance influences the sustainability performance of the banks positively. Consequently, this research contributes to the research on legitimacy-driven behavior of Bangladeshi banks. This behavior rather leads to a reactive adoption of sustainability activities instead of proactive behavior.

# 1. Introduction

Recently, there has been an increasing number of calls for a more sustainable financial industry [1] that even motivated the Financial Stability Board of the G20 to establish a Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosure [2]. With the economic rise of many Asian countries, integrating sustainable finance into the financial industry of these countries is important to address environmental and social issues, such as environmental pollution [3] and inequality [4]. To address both organizational ethics and financial sector stability, several countries, among them China and Bangladesh, introduced financial industry sustainability policies in addition to voluntary codes of conduct implemented by the industry. These countries experience severe environmental issues, such as air and water pollution, that have significant effects on their population and therefore try to decrease lending to and investing in polluting industries as well as to increase financing of more environmentally friendly industries. Bangladesh Bank, for instance, introduced the Environmental Risk Management Guidelines (ERM) in 2011 [5] to engage the financial sector in green finance.

As financial sector sustainability regulations are relatively new, there is a lack of research about the effect of these policies on both the financial and the sustainability performance of the regulated industries. Furthermore, there is a gap in the knowledge about the connection between sustainability performance and the financial performance of banks in countries with such policies. Most of the studies published so far address the Chinese Green Credit Policy [6–10]. Those studies found a positive effect of green banking activities, such as green lending and the financial performance of the financial.

institutions. Studies addressing a South Asian country such as Bangladesh are sparse, and their results are controversial. However, they agree that sustainable banking, including corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting, is in an early phase in Bangladesh [11–15].

Though ERM has been introduced in 2011, only a few banks in Bangladesh even adopted green banking guidelines at this time [16]. However, Ahmed and Ahmed [17], for instance, found that the sustainability performance of Bangladeshi banks has increased since then. Nevertheless, they did not find a correlation between their environmental and financial performance. Other studies that addressed the lending business, however, found that integrating sustainability criteria into the lending business decreases the number of default loans and consequently has a positive impact on a lender’s financial performance [18]. Despite some research on sustainability in Bangladeshi banks, the question remains whether regulatory sustainability guidelines improve both the environmental and financial performance of the regulated banks.

We use legitimacy theory [19, 20] to explain why and how Bangladeshi banks adopt sustainability strategies and what the consequences are for their financial performance. The theory states that banks will adopt environmental regulations and increase their sustainability performance if there is outside pressure. Furthermore, the theory claims that external pressure is stronger for bigger banks than smaller banks. Finally, according to the theory, adopting guidelines because of legitimacy concerns will not lead to integration into the banks’ strategies. Consequently, our three research questions are whether higher sustainability performance increases financial performance, whether better financial performance leads to higher sustainability performance, and whether bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks.

To respond to the research questions, we analyzed all 56 regulated Bangladeshi banks between 2012 and 2016 based on their annual reports, CSR, or similar reports and on the information from their websites. In line with a study that addressed a similar question in China [8], an indicator system that consists of social and environmental sustainability indicators has been used to calculate a sustainability score (SS) for the banks. The score has been used as the independent variable to predict the financial performance of the banks as well as the dependent variable based on a lagged panel regression and Granger causality calculation [21].

The results of the study demonstrate that higher sustainability performance creates higher financial performance. However, the analysis did not find that higher financial performance influences the sustainability performance of the banks positively. Finally, we could show that bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks.

Following legitimacy theory, we conclude that the analyzed banks are rather reactive concerning their sustainability strategy and that they mainly respond to the institutional pressure of Bangladesh Bank because of legitimacy purposes. Instead of integrating sustainability aspects into their core business to decrease risks and to increase the opportunities of green banking, and consequently increase their financial performance, banks rather react in a stakeholder-oriented fashion to keep their legitimacy. Consistent with legitimacy theory, they are biased towards activities favorable to stakeholders instead of a strategic sustainability approach.

The study contributes to legitimacy theory in sustainable banking and its financial consequences. It demonstrates that increased sustainability performance has a positive effect on the financial performance of banks, as intended by Bangladesh Bank’s ERM, but that this information is not integrated into the banks’ business strategies. Furthermore, the research contributes to legitimacy theory by adding knowledge about the legitimacy-driven behavior of South Asian banks. Moreover, our results contribute to theory by suggesting that legitimacy-driven behavior might not lead to strategic corporate sustainability that addresses the main societal issues in a proactive way.

The remainder of the paper describes the background literature and the theory, followed by the presentation of the sample and methods. Finally, we report the results of the study and finish with a discussion and conclusions.

# 2. Background

Several studies have analyzed financial sustainability regulations and their impact on regulated banks. Most of these studies explore the impact of the Chinese Green Credit Guidelines. Some studies, however, also examine Bangladeshi banks with regard to their sustainability. In general, however, studies on this topic in South Asia are sparse. The following sections present an overview of empirical findings on banks and sustainability, financial sector sustainability regulations and policies, as well as theoretical findings on financial sector sustainability regulations and sustainability in banking.

Banks started integrating non-financial environmental and social aspects into their business during the 1980s. Firstly, they addressed internal environmental management [22], resulting in water, energy, and materials savings, as well as in lower emissions and high reputation [23]. As the second step, banks integrated environmental issues into lending, investing, asset management, and project finance [24]. Hence, they became CSR intermediaries [25] that influence the CSR of their clients, because higher corporate social performance (CSP) mitigates borrowers’ financial risks [26]. Consequently, voluntary sustainability codes of conduct, such as the United Nations Environmental Program Financial Initiative (UNEPFI), the UN Principles for Responsible Investing (UNPRI), and the Equator Principles have been instigated [27].

Sustainability risks, such as those caused by climate change or negative environmental impacts of commercial borrowers or investees, have a significant influence on the financial risk of credit and investment portfolios. Consequently, they have to be managed thoroughly [7, 28]. Therefore, many banks have implemented sustainable credit risk assessment procedures [29] and have been using environmental, social, and governance criteria to conduct responsible investments [30 – 32]. Some studies, however, suggest that the sustainability strategies of many banks are not substantially addressing their core business and the main societal issues [33].

For a long time, the pressure on the financial sector to perform well concerning the sustainability impact of their main products and services, such as lending and investing, has been lower than in many other industries (Weber et al., 2014). Studies have found, however, that environmental and sustainability reporting positively correlates with the size and the profitability of financial institutions [14, 34, 35]. Furthermore, the integration of environmental and sustainability issues into financial sector products and services has been increasing over time and has positive effects on the banks’ financial performance (Scholtens, 2008a).

Consequently, one of the motivations for integrating sustainability into the banking business is the correlation with the financial performance of banks. Igbudu and Garanti [36] suggest that sustainable banking increases the banks’ loyalty and corporate reputation, while a study in Germany identified a strong growth potential for social banking [37] and, therefore, a new market to tap into. Furthermore, studies found a positive connection between corporate social responsibility and financial performance in the banking sector [38, 39], between sustainability, measured by the membership in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), and efficiency [40], as well as between responsible investing and financial returns [41, 42]. However, Climent [43] found that ethical banks are less profitable than their conventional counterparts but that they have more substantial growth in their lending business.

Additionally, several studies suggest that banks are rather reactive and defensive concerning the incorporation of sustainability aspects into their core businesses [44, 45]. Many of them focus on short-term results and do not integrate sustainability into their core business [46]. The need for a sustainability culture [47] to develop capabilities and to provide resources to improve corporate sustainability performance, however, is not only a phenomenon in the financial industry but in all sectors [48 – 51]. Consequently, financial sector sustainability regulations should take into account that banks might not have the necessary capabilities and resources to implement the regulations efficiently in a way that increases their financial performance.

Though heavily regulated compared with other industrial sectors, the financial sector’s exposure to institutional pressure and regulations addressing sustainability [52], environmental, and societal risks [53, 54] is relatively small. Financial sector regulations focus mainly on risk-adjusted.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

financial capital provisions, financial risks, and guaranteeing the stability of the financial industry. Newer approaches, however, also address the impact of the financial sector on sustainable development and risks for the stability of the financial industry caused by sustainability risks, such as climate change [55]. Mainly, regulations and policies addressing the impact of climate change on the financial sector are discussed, for instance, by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures [56], but also in academia [57].

Financial sector sustainability regulations are implemented mainly for two reasons: (1) to increase green lending and investment and (2) to enhance the financial sector’s financial stability [7, 18, 58]. The financial sector sustainability regulation that is most frequently discussed in academic publications is the Chinese Green Credit Policy, introduced by the China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2012 [6]. Whether the Chinese regulation has achieved its goals is controversial. Zhao and Xu [59] state that the Green Credit Policy will increase green lending and consequently contribute to sustainable development. Additionally, studies that analyzed the sustainability performance of Chinese banks found that banks with a higher green lending ratio and higher sustainability performance are exposed to lower risks [7–9]. Jiguang and Zhiqun [60] are more critical and claim that additional regulations and internationalization is needed to promote green finance, particularly carbon finance. Similarly, another study asks for better implementation mechanisms to guarantee the success of the green credit policy [10]. A study that addresses financial industry sustainability regulations in South America from a macro perspective, however, found a positive effect of these regulations on the financial stability of the financial industry [58].

The need to increase capabilities to become more sustainable, even in the presence of regulations, is emphasized by two studies. They suggest that environmental risk management practices have to be improved to avoid a trade-off between the sustainability performance of banks and their financial performance [61,62].

A study that addresses the implementation problem in Bangladesh came to a similar conclusion. Though there is a potential for sustainable banking to have positive effects on banks’ financial performance, the necessary capabilities for sustainable banking, such as sustainable credit rating expertise and systems, are often missing [18]. Additionally, a study analyzing the situation in India suggests that the public sector banking industry addresses sustainability in a defensive and preventive way. The research indicates that banks adopt the regulatory norms but are not pro-active in addressing sustainable development in their business [45].

Positive impacts of sustainable banking on sustainable development, however, have been identified in a study analyzing Nigerian banks [63]. Similar to banks in China and Bangladesh, Nigerian banks are regulated through a sustainable banking policy overseen by the domestic banking regulator [55]. Hence, such regulations might change banks toward a direction where they contribute to sustainable development and reduce their financing of unsustainable businesses and projects [64].

Bangladesh Bank introduced the Environmental Risk Management (ERM) Guidelines for Banks and Financial Institutions in Bangladesh in 2011 [5]. Their goal is to incentivize banks to integrate environmental and social criteria into their credit risk management procedures and consequently to improve the environmental and social standards in Bangladesh’s industries. ERM introduced guidelines and tools to improve the sustainability assessment as well as refinancing schemes for environmentally sustainable projects [18]. Consequently, if adopted, the policy should influence the environmental sustainability performance of Bangladeshi banks. Several studies assessing the corporate sustainability performance of Bangladesh companies and banks, however, suggest that corporate sustainability and corporate sustainability reporting is on a low level compared to other countries.

One of the earliest studies, as well as newer research on corporate sustainability reporting in Bangladesh, state that both the quantity and the quality of environmental disclosures are poor compared to those in many other countries [34, 65], though many stakeholders in Bangladesh ask for transparent corporate reporting [66]. The reasons for the lack of disclosure are a shortage of resources, the exclusive

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

focus on profit, lack of legal requirements, lack of awareness and capacity, poor sustainability performance, and the fear of bad publicity [67]. Additionally, studies on the sustainability reporting of Bangladeshi banks echo these results [12]. Khan and Islam [13], for instance, found that only a few Bangladeshi banks address all the criteria proposed by the Global Reporting Initiative. For example, only a few banks conduct environmental disclosure [68]. A reason for these results might be low stakeholder pressure, particularly from the general public [15]. Since 2010, however, funds allocated to green banking are increasing in Bangladesh, though the absolute value is still low [11]. Finally, public commercial banks in Bangladesh adopted the ERM guideline and increased their green lending [16] as well as their sustainability activities [69]. To close the gap in the literature about the adoption of green banking regulations in South Asia, the objective of our study is to analyze the sustainability performance of Bangladeshi banks, the connection between their sustainability performance and financial performance, and the influence of the banks’ size and their sustainability performance.

# 3. Theory

The study is based on legitimacy theory [20]. In line with Suchman, we define legitimacy as a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of Bangladeshi banks are appropriate within the norms created by the regulator Bangladesh Bank. Related research found that legitimacy-based sustainability activities of firms are reactions to external pressure [70]. The emphasis here lies on reactive, meaning that corporations do not engage in sustainability activities as a proactive way to increase their business performance but as a reaction to stakeholder pressure or events. Consequently, activities decrease when pressure decreases [71].

Another implication based on legitimacy theory is that bigger institutions are more exposed to public pressure and therefore react more strongly [72]. In our study, we assume that bigger banks are more exposed to the influence of the public, including the regulator. Consequently, they conduct sustainability activities because of self-interest and normative approval [20]. Finally, in line with legitimacy theory, we hypothesize that banks report more about the environment than about social issues because the ERM mainly addresses environmental sustainability.

Sustainability activities triggered by legitimacy concerns, however, are not stable and do not address the core strategies and activities of banks but try to satisfy stakeholders. Therefore, we hypothesize that banks do not increase their sustainability activities even if they were able to improve their financial performance because of their sustainability activities. Hence, they do not follow a strategic corporate sustainability approach [73].

To summarize, our main hypotheses are (1) that Bangladeshi banks are reactive with regard to their sustainability activities, (2) that bigger banks perform a stronger reaction than smaller banks, (3) that Bangladeshi banks mainly focus on the environmental aspect of sustainability, and (4) that the financial success of sustainability activities does not lead to increased activities in the following year.

# 4. Materials and Methods

We analyzed all 56 scheduled commercial banks that are operating under the guidelines of the Central Bank of Bangladesh. Data for the sample was collected from publicly available reports, such as annual, sustainability, and CSR reports, disclosed sustainability and financial information on the banks’ websites, including all bank branches, as well as data published by the Bangladesh Bank. We conducted a document analysis using NVIVO software. The keywords are in line with similar studies [8,24] and are based on the criteria of the Global Reporting Initiative [74–76].

The sample consists of four types of banks, state-owned commercial banks (SOB), specialized development banks (SDB), private commercial banks (PCB), and foreign commercial banks (FCB) (see Table 1). Data was collected for the years between 2012 and 2016. The year 2016 was the year we found full disclosure for all banks in the sample at the time of gathering the data. The first year is the

Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

year of the implementation of the ERM guides. Only 22 out of the 56 banks, however, have published any information related to environmental, social, and sustainability aspects.

Financial data was gathered from the banks’ annual reports. We used total assets (TA), net profit after tax (NPAT), return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE) as key financial accounting indicators. In line with [19], TA was used to measure the size of the banks. The other indicators have been used by similar studies that address the link between sustainability performance and financial performance in the banking sector (see, for instance, [7,8,38,77]).

The analysis of the sustainability performance was conducted in line with earlier studies that analyzed the sustainability performance of banks [8]. It is based on the framework of the Global Reporting Initiative [74]. The analysis assessed the presence of strategies, activities, products, and services in the categories of social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services. The latter were assessed because they are addressed by the ERM. If an indicator was mentioned, a bank achieved a value 1 for the indicator. Otherwise, it achieved the value 0.

To analyze Granger causality [21], we used panel regression models with one-year lags for sustainability performance and financial performance, respectively. As the Hausman test [78] was significant, we used fixed-effects models. To control for accuracy of the regression, we used bootstrapping [79].

# 5. Results

We start by presenting the major financial and sustainability indicators of the banks in the sample, split by banking types (see Table 2). In line with Bangladesh Bank, we distinguished between conventional commercial banks, foreign commercial banks, Islamic banks, specialized banks, and state-owned commercial banks.

Table 3 presents the percentage of banks that mentioned at least one of the respective sustainability indicators and the average per category. The results suggest an increase in disclosure over time and that environmental indicators are mentioned more often than social and green products and services indicators.

The three categories, social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services, were tested for homogeneity using Cronbach’s alpha [80]. All three categories achieved a value higher than 0.8, with αsocial = 0.87, αenvironment = 0.87, and αgreen = 0.85. Consequently, based on the disclosure of the indicators, a sustainability score was calculated for each bank. First, we calculated the sum of the values for environmental, social, and green indicators. Then, the banks’ results were divided by the maximum achievable value to standardize the values for the banks’ performance in the respective category. Lastly, a sustainability score (SS) was calculated using the average of the environmental, social, and green scores. As a result, SS is an equally weighted combination of the environmental, social, and green products and services scores. The descriptive statistics of the categories and SS are presented in Table 4.

# Test Statistics

To control for differences between government banks and other banks as well as between domestic banks and international banks, we conducted t-tests with SS as the dependent variable. We found a statistically significant difference between domestic and international banks with regard to their SS performance (df = 278, t = 3.274, p = 0.001). Domestic banks performed better with regard to the sustainability score than international banks (𝑥domestic = 0.435, 𝑥international = 0.338). The t-test for government-owned banks and other banks did not result in a statistically significant difference between these two groups (df = 278, t = −1.097, p = 0.274).

Secondly, we tested the difference between the three categories: social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services. The results of the Hotelling Test [82] indicate a significant difference between the three categories (T2 = 1871, F = 619.2, p < 0.0001). Environmental sustainability achieves the highest average, with social sustainability as the second-highest category, followed by green products and services (𝑥environment = 0.61, 𝑥social = 0.41, 𝑥green products = 0.24).

As the next step, we analyzed the change in the sustainability performance SS as well as of the three sustainability sub-groups over time, as we assumed that the introduction of the ERM created a change with regard to the banks’ sustainability performance. The change over time is presented in Figure 1, suggesting a slight increase in all three sustainability fields over time.

|2014|0.6|
|2015|0.7|
|2016|0.8|

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

We tested the increase of the sustainability performance over time using an ANOVA for repeated measurement with the year and the banks as factors and the sustainability score as the dependent variable. The results of the ANOVA show that the change of the sustainability score over time is significant (F = 24.86, df = 4, p < 0.0001) and that there is a significant difference in the sustainability score between the banks (F = 12.83, df = 55, p < 0.0001). Additionally, the full model is significant (F = 13.65, df = 59, p < 0.0001) and explains 79 percent of the total variance.

In addition, Figure 1 shows that the development over time is very similar for all three categories. As tested above, the environmental sustainability category has the highest value before social sustainability and green products and services.

As the next step, we conducted a fixed-effects panel regression (see above for the Haussman test indicating fixed effects). The financial indicators and the sustainability score were used as independent and time-lagged dependent variables, respectively, to analyze cause and effect between the sustainability score and the financial performance using Granger causality (see Table 5). To control for accuracy, we used bootstrapping with 50 replications. The results of the one-year time lags are presented in Table 6. Two- and three-year time lags did not suggest different results but are based on fewer data.

# Table 6. Panel regression with time lag with the sustainability score and financial indicators as independent and dependent variables.

| |Sustainability Score|ROE|−0.004|0.099|0.712|
| |ROE|Sustainability Score|2.13|0.20|0.0130|

The results show significant regressions for SS predicting the lagged financial indicators. The higher SS, the higher the financial indicators of the banks. The coefficients are positive and significant. Concerning the ability of the financial indicators to predict SS, only total assets, the indicator for the size of the banks, can predict the sustainability performance of a bank. There are no significant regressions for the other financial indicators as independent variables. Hence, the sustainability indicator is able to predict the financial performance, but financial indicators are not able to predict the sustainability performance of banks.

To test these findings for robustness, we used bootstrapping with 50 repetitions [79] and added the bank type as specified in Table 1 to the panel regressions. The results are presented in Table 7.

The results presented in Table 7 indicate that the regression is robust. The same regression is significant after 50 bootstrapping repetitions. Furthermore, we did not find significant impacts of the type of bank on the prediction of the financial or the sustainability performance. The only significant coefficient for the type of bank is for the prediction of the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio, because state-owned banks have a higher NPL ratio than other banks.

# 6. Discussion

This study analyzed the connection between sustainability performance and the financial performance of Bangladeshi banks. We used panel regressions with one-year time lags and both financial indicators and a sustainability score SS as dependent and independent lagged variables, respectively. The analysis of all scheduled commercial banks in Bangladesh found that a higher SS performance leads to better financial performance one year later. However, the study also suggests that better financial performance does not lead to higher sustainability performance in the following year. The results shine a light on organizational ethics and sustainability in the Bangladeshi banking industry.

Concerning the type of sustainability performance, our results indicate that all three, social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and green products and services, have been increasing in parallel over time. Environmental sustainability and green products and services, however, are not growing stronger than social sustainability, as could have been expected after the introduction of the ERM guidelines. Finally, we found that bigger banks perform better with regard to sustainability than smaller banks.

The following sections will discuss the results based on legitimacy theory [20]. According to this theory, the banks in our sample should react to institutional pressure reactively. They do not engage in sustainability activities proactively as would be predicted by strategic CSR [73].

The institutional pressure conducted through the ERM guidelines drives Bangladeshi banks to become more sustainable. They want to take the opportunity of the lower-cost capital provision by Bangladesh Bank and wish to avoid the adverse effects on their legitimacy of not reacting to the.

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 7999

guidelines. This reaction increases the banks’ sustainability performance and finally improves their financial performance, as found in many other studies [8,38].

The somewhat surprising result that increased financial performance does not improve sustainability performance can also be interpreted based on legitimacy theory. The banks in the sample react to outside factors and perform socially desired sustainability activities in return for approval of their business activities. However, they do not strategically internalize sustainability. If they did, the additional financial returns would lead to increased sustainability activities in the following year. In our study, however, we only found an impact of the sustainability performance on the lagged financial performance and not the other way around as, for instance, Waddock and Graves [83] report.

We also found a strong connection between the size of the banks, measured by their total assets, and their sustainability performance. This result is also in line with the legitimacy theory [19, 20], stating that bigger organizations are more exposed to public pressure and therefore invest more in their reputation [84] and stakeholder relations [85]. Additionally, Alberici and Querci [35] found that the quality of environmental activities of finance organizations increases with their size.

Similar to Islam and Kokubu [85], we found a general increase in all three types of sustainability activities. Again, legitimacy-based activities are rather reactive and general instead of addressing particular business activities and trying to improve their sustainability performance. Instead, the Bangladeshi banks address prevailing societal norms asking for corporate sustainability in general instead of specific actions that are connected to the banks’ business. Therefore, we also found only a few banks that have implemented green financial products and services.

Concerning organizational ethics and sustainability in South Asia, the results suggest that regulatorily induced sustainability activities have a positive effect on Bangladeshi banks. Some studies in other world regions came to similar conclusions, for instance, in China [7, 86], but also in North America and Europe [87]. The missing connection between financial performance and sustainability performance at a later stage, however, seems to be specific for the Bangladesh sample. Waddock and Graves [83] established this connection and explained it with the institutional impact on both corporate sustainability performance and financial performance. Furthermore, they explain the positive impact of the sustainability performance on financial performance with the good management theory [88, 89]. Hence, it seems that sustainability is not a part of good management in Bangladeshi banks yet and that the banks in the sample do not realize that they can create additional value through sustainability approaches [90].

Another interesting issue related to corporate sustainability in South Asia is that environmental sustainability is more often mentioned by the banks in the sample than social sustainability. However, topics such as inclusion and equality are a top priority in many South Asian countries [4, 91]. The latter includes stakeholder engagement, community building, social inclusion, and so on. These issues should be at the core of sustainable banking in Bangladesh and other South Asian countries. However, an earlier study by Khan and Islam [13] suggests a similar result. Hence, it looks like there has not been much change in addressing social sustainability issues. As expected, the Bangladesh ERM did not improve this situation but only influenced the environmental performance of the banks. As Bangladeshi banks seem to have reputational motivations to integrate sustainability into their business, regulations addressing social sustainability might lead to an improvement in this regard.

Overall, it looks like the Bangladeshi banking sector has been increasing its sustainability performance between 2012 and 2016. One reason for this development might be the ERM that has been introduced in 2012. Because of the correlation between sustainability performance and financial performance, it not only contributes to improving the industry’s environmental and social performance, but also to its financial performance. This finding is in line with the goals of the ERM and other financial industry sustainability regulations, such as the Chinese Green Credit Policy [7–10]. However, to increase the influence of the banking industry on sustainable development, a more long-term sustainability orientation is needed [92] that is supported by investments in sustainability performance.

# 7. Conclusions

The results of our study contribute to legitimacy theory by showing that legitimacy is not only a driver for CSR reporting but also for CSR-related activities. The banks in our sample have implemented some sustainability activities because external stakeholders expect this behavior. However, the activities are reactive and not firmly connected to the banks’ businesses. Green financial products and services, for instance, are not growing more than general social and environmental sustainability activities.

Our practical contribution addresses strategic sustainability in banking. The results suggest that banks should not only follow sustainability regulations but that they need to develop a strategy to benefit from the sustainable business approach. With regards to regulators, our results suggest that they should also offer training and tools to enable banks to build the necessary capacity to implement sustainability into their businesses.

Our research was limited with regard to data gathering. We only used publicly available data. Future research might use data from the banks that is gathered through interviews, portfolio analyses, as well as product and services analyses. Furthermore, the impacts of the sustainability performance on the environment and society should be analyzed in future research to explore the sustainability effects of financial sustainability regulations. This analysis should be done from a stakeholder perspective.

# Determinants of corporate sustainability performance – evidence from Brazilian panel data

# Vicente Lima Crisostomo, Fatima de Souza Freire and Maria Rafaela De Oliveira Freitas

# Abstract

Purpose – Over the past two decades, there has been an increasing interest on corporate social responsibility by a number of constituencies – corporate managers, research scholars, policymakers and investors. In this context, corporate sustainability performance (CSP) has been a central focus of attention. This paper aims to analyze CSP determinants in Brazil, an important emerging market. Firm CSP is proxied by the membership to the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) which comprises environmental, social, economic and governance issues.

Design/methodology/approach – Logit panel data models are estimated for a sample of 2,685 firm-year observations in the period of 2006-2015.

Findings – Results show that firms operating in environmental risky industries tend to be leading CSP firms in Brazil which might be a positive consequence of the Brazilian environmental legislation that could be forcing such firms to be more committed to environmental issues. High ownership concentration reduces the probability of a firm’s membership to the ISE index signaling that large controlling blockholders may not see sustainability and governance concerns as relevant. Larger Brazilian firms and the ones with more growth opportunities tend to be CSP leaders. Additionally, the financial crisis of 2007-2009 had a negative effect on CSP in Brazil.

Practical implications – The implications of the present findings may be of interest to academics and firms’ stakeholders. The fact that firms from environmental risky industries exhibit higher concerns with CSP, probably because of the Brazilian environmental rules that has advanced in the past decades, show the prominence of policymakers in the critical scenario of environmental issues. When designing regulation, policymakers should be conscious of the importance of social issues and pay attention to all ways available to foster firm sustainability concerns. The additional evidence that dominant shareholders do not appear to see CSP as a relevant concern in Brazil points out an agency conflict in which large blockholders’ interests may be prevailing over other stakeholders’ interests. That is important to academics who study the role played by ownership structure on firm’s policies. Furthermore, larger firms, as well as the ones with more growth opportunities, seem to invest in CSP, possibly for seeing it as a way to generate competitive advantage.

Originality/value – As per the authors’ knowledge this is the first paper to point out the relevance of industry environmental sensitivity over firm’s commitment to sustainability issues in Brazil. Additional evidence is provided on the negative effect of ownership concentration on the probability of firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index using a longer period as well as robust logit panel data model estimates compared to previous studies. Unlike previous works, the paper analyzes the complexity of a sustainability index in the Brazilian market. Such index comprises corporate social responsibility, sustainability and corporate governance concerns. This set of concerns makes it a complex index and requires a deeper rationale for the determinants of CSP as proxied by the membership to it, under the stakeholder and agency theoretical frameworks.

and governance concerns cooperatively (Harrison et al., 2010). This range of stakeholders goes beyond the ones taken into account by the agency theory – shareholders, managers and creditors – and has caused a growing concern for firms about their operation, sustainability and relation with all stakeholders as predicted under the stakeholder theoretical framework. This means that the firm should not only worry about value creation for shareholders but also about the welfare of all social groups and the adequate interaction with the environment (Freeman and Phillips, 2002; Tullberg, 2013).

Corporate social responsibility (CSR) actions and the awareness to sustainability issues as a whole have been considered as able to improve firm’s reputation, with possible benefits on firm’s value, although the results are still inconclusive (Freeman et al., 2004; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Park et al., 2014). In this context, the assessment of corporate sustainability performance (CSP), taking into account environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) concerns, by specialized institutions has become usual, highlighting the importance given to social concerns and long-term sustainability of firms by market institutions (Chen and Nainggolan, 2018; Statman, 2006). The Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) of BM&FBOVESPA which comprises ESG issues of the Brazilian firm was launched in 2005 (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015).

The motivating factors that drive corporate sustainability policy at the firm level have been highlighted as an important topic of research that requires additional attention (Dam and Scholtens, 2012; Aguilera et al., 2007). Undertaking such research in emerging economies has also been highlighted as necessary (Ziegler and Schröder, 2010). In this regard, this work intends to advance research in the emerging markets framework by studying Brazil, an emerging economy with increasing international visibility, characterized by high private benefits of control, high ownership concentration and low protection of minority shareholders which favors the prevalence of controlling shareholders’ interests (Dyck and Zingales, 2004; La Porta et al., 1998). Besides, Brazil has faced some institutional advances in environmental protection in recent decades although there is still much to be done (Tollefson, 2016).

Under the Brazilian environmental legislation, Law 10.165/2000 categorized industries’ environmental risk and enforced government environmental control. At this moment, it is important to assess whether these institutional advances observed in the Brazilian environmental legislation have been able to produce effects on the firm level.

This research aims to analyze firm’s attributes that are related to social and sustainability policies of Brazilian firms, focusing on firm’s environmental risk and ownership concentration. In this regard, more recently, ownership structure has been suggested to play a role on firm’s social and sustainability policies because of distinct shareholders’ interests and the diversity in institutional contexts (Dam and Scholtens, 2012; Aguilera et al., 2007; Li and Zhang, 2010), as well as the environmental risk of firm’s activities (Adams, 2002; Crifo et al., 2015; Hackston and Milne, 1996). Additionally, the study also searches for the effect of the financial crisis (2007-2009) on CSP and its eventual recovery in the aftermath.

To achieve this purpose, logistic regression models were estimated for a panel data set of 327 Brazilian listed firms, in a total of 2,685 firm-year observations, in the period of 2006-2015. The annual membership to the ISE of BM&FBOVESPA is used as proxy for higher CSP.

The results show that firm’s membership to an environmental risky industry, according the Brazilian environmental law, is able to improve firm’s CSP. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries are leading CSP firms in Brazil given that they present higher probability to be a component of the ISE sustainability index. The findings also indicate that CSP proxied by the membership to the ISE sustainability index is adversely affected by high ownership concentration. This reveals the presence of an agency conflict in which dominant shareholders’ interests prevail over CSP, given that the presence of such shareholders lowers the probability that the firm becomes member of the annual Brazilian ISE. It is worth

mentioning that the negative effect of voting ownership concentration disappears with the presence of more large shareholders, taken into account by the voting ownership held by the four and five largest shareholders, signaling a possible contest power from other large shareholders who may favor CSR. Furthermore, other firm attributes also increase firm CSP, firm size and firm growth opportunities in Brazil.

The present work offers insights on the determinants of firm’s social and sustainability policies in an important emerging market (Brazil). The research builds on stakeholder and agency theories by investigating the possible effect of industry environmental risk and ownership concentration on CSP as proxied by firm’s membership to the Brazilian firm ISE. The study contributes to the literature that deals with firm membership to sustainability indices set by capital markets as a proxy for social and sustainability performance (Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Crisostomo and Oliveira, 2016; Artiach et al., 2010). Specifically, the paper complements prior studies in the Brazilian market about CSP determinants by taking into account the industry environmental risk, using a larger variety of proxies for ownership concentration, extending the period of study and using panel data methodology that provides even more robust results and allows better analysis on the CSP determinants.

# 2. Background and hypotheses

# 2.1 The assessment of corporate sustainability

Literature suggests that firms actions related to sustainability are associated with ethical, environmental and economic criteria of a firm’s decision-making process to ensure business continuity, while corporate social policy may be more associated to the willingness of the firm to undertake actions that benefit stakeholders (Van Marrewijk and Werre, 2003). As a whole, corporate social and sustainability concerns integrate business ethics and stakeholder management, being all associated and complementary concepts under development (Sarkar and Searcy, 2016; Carroll and Shabana, 2010). Conceptual questions apart, assessing the degree of attention that a firm directs to social and sustainability concerns is a complex task and there is still no agreement on how it should be done. In fact, there are a variety of measures used in this context trying to adequately evaluate firm’s social and sustainability concerns (Griffin and Mahon, 1997; Orlitzky et al., 2003).

The assessment of CSP as a whole may take into account firm sustainability, firm social concerns, business ethics, stakeholder management and environmental issues. Specialized institutions have worked on it and created indices that intend to convey information about the level of firms’ CSP (Statman, 2006). Examples of such indices are the ones created by market institutions like the Dow Jones Sustainability Index of the New York Stock Exchange; the FTSE-4Good in the London Stock Exchange; the Johannesburg Index in South Africa; and the Brazilian ISE set up by the Brazilian stock market.

# 2.2 The Brazilian corporate sustainability index

The ISE index is a theoretical portfolio, composed by up to 40 firms that are included into it based on an assessment process conducted by the ISE Advisory Committee. This committee is composed by 11 institutions, being headed by the Sa˜ o Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&FBOVESPA) (Cunha and Samanez, 2013; BM&FBOVESPA, 2015). The information used in the assessment process is supplied by the company through a questionnaire. A firm that intends to participate in the ISE assessment process must fulfill the following requirements (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015):

- the firm must be among the 200 most traded in the stock market in the past year;
- the firm must have been traded in at least 50 per cent of the stock exchange sessions in the preceding year;

# 2.2 ISE Assessment Process

The firm must comply with the criteria endorsed by the ISE Advisory Committee Executive Council.

The ISE assessment process comprises seven areas or axes, related to both CSR and sustainability, distributed along the questionnaire:

- The axis “general information” (14 per cent of the questions) assesses how the firm behaves in relation to global agreements and whether the firm publishes social reports.
- The axis “nature of the product” (9.5 per cent of the questions) requires information about the risks and damages for human health associated with the firm’s products.
- The axis “corporate governance” (17 per cent of the questions) intends to evaluate shareholders relationships and the quality of the firm’s corporate governance system.
- The axis “financial-economics” (10 per cent of the questions) captures information about firm’s strategic planning, risk management and financial performance.
- The axis “social” (14 per cent of the questions) tries to assess firm’s relations with workers, suppliers and clients.
- The axis “climate change” (25 per cent of the questions) appraises whether the company is actually committed to policies for climate change prevention.
- The axis “environmental” (14 per cent of the questions) assesses firm’s concern with the natural environmental through the analysis of the number of problems with environmental licenses, or criminal prosecution because of environmental crimes.

Invited firms respond the ISE questionnaire in a voluntary manner. Firm assessment is based on quantitative and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analysis is based on the questionnaire score, in which all CSP axes have the same weight, with specific criteria and indicators in each axis. The qualitative analysis is based on the checking of supporting documents that are also requested from companies. Then, cluster analysis is run with the purpose of identifying groups of firms with similar CSP and make up firm ranking to compose the ISE portfolio that integrates up to the 40 best performing firms (BM&FBOVESPA, 2015).

# 2.3 Determinants of Corporate Sustainability Performance

The determinants of CSP are analyzed under distinct theoretical frameworks. Some firm’s attributes have been seen as able to affect CSP. Among such factors are, for example, firm size, profitability and leverage. More recently, agency conflicts, firm industry environmental risk as well as growth opportunities have also been considered.

There is evidence that ownership structure moderates agency conflicts among the main firm stakeholders. For instance, agency conflicts between shareholders and managers are moderated by ownership structure (Shleifer and Vishny, 1986; Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). Furthermore, there is evidence that ownership structure matters for firm value and performance as well as for firm strategic and financial policies (Allen and Phillips, 2000; Goergen and Renneboog, 2001; Schiantarelli and Sembenelli, 2000). Thus, it is plausible to suggest that ownership structure may also influence firm’s sustainability policy (Aguilera et al., 2007).

Research in different markets signals that ownership structure characteristics may matter for firm’s sustainability policy, under distinct arguments, although with inconclusive results (Faller and zu Knyphausen-Aufseß, 2016). For example, there is a positive effect of high firm ownership concentration in hands of the main shareholder on CSR in Spain (Godos Dı´ez et al., 2012). Equity ownership held by individual shareholder types has also received special attention. Institutional investors have a positive effect on CSR in USA.

(Harjoto and Jo, 2008). Government ownership favors CSR in Singapore and Malaysia (Eng and Mak, 2003; Said et al., 2009). In USA, internal ownership has a negative impact on CSR (Barnea and Rubin, 2010) and non-state ownership has an adverse effect on CSR in China (Li and Zhang, 2010). In Europe, ownership concentration held by the main shareholder is also detrimental to CSR (Lopez-Iturriaga and Lopez-de-Foronda, 2011). Ownership structure playing a role on firm’s policies is closely linked to the agency theory given that its influence may raise or minimize agency conflicts.

Firm controlling shareholders, who are common in high ownership concentrated firms, are interested in improving firm reputation which may be obtained from social and sustainability policies according to the legitimacy and stakeholder theoretical approaches (Chiu and Sharfman, 2011). Thus, they may use social and sustainability policy to achieve this goal by prioritizing social and sustainability elements that may be more favorable to their purpose.

High concentrated ownership, frequently associated to a reduced number of controlling shareholders, may promote the exacerbation of private benefits of control (Riyanto and Toolsema, 2008) and may also be detrimental to the adoption of good corporate governance practices under the argument that controlling shareholders benefit from weaker corporate governance (La Porta et al., 1998; Bozec and Bozec, 2007; Renders and Gaeremynck, 2012).

Sustainability indices, as is the case of ISE in Brazil, have corporate governance as a very relevant component as mentioned above (Section 2.2). In this context, high ownership concentration may also be negative to public firm accountability that tends to improve with a decrease in ownership concentration and more shareholders pressuring for better firm accountability in the opposite direction of high ownership concentration (Li and Zhang, 2010).

Although stakeholders theorists claim the value creation capacity of social and sustainability performance, such capacity for value creation is still uncertain (Husted and Allen, 2007). This doubtful value creation capacity of firm’s social and sustainability activities may discourage controlling shareholders to undertake social and sustainability policies. Besides, corporate governance which is not a priority for dominant blockholders is really important in the ISE sustainability index. Thus, it seems plausible to propose the hypothesis that dominant shareholders of the Brazilian firm are looking for private benefits of control and do not prioritize the improvement of firm sustainability in its entirety. This rationale leads to the proposal that voting ownership concentration is negative to CSP as proxied by the membership to the ISE sustainability index in the following terms:

# H1.

Ownership concentration has an adverse effect on the probability of the firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index which signals firm CSP.

Firm’s commitment to social and sustainability issues have been proposed to be favorable to firm’s image and reputation under the legitimacy and stakeholder theoretical frameworks (Bebbington et al., 2008; Michelon, 2011). Nowadays, environmental concerns are relevant for firm’s external valuation, and this reality has motivated more complete firm sustainability disclosure (Crifo et al., 2015; Bouten et al., 2011). In fact, empirical research has proposed and found evidence on the influence that environmental activities have on corporate reputation (D’Souza et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2012).

Firms from environmental risky industries have more complex relation with the natural environment and external stakeholders tend to be more focused on such firms’ concerns on environmental issues (Hackston and Milne, 1996; Adams, 2002; Patten, 2002; Campbell, 2003). Because of this higher vulnerability to environmental concerns and pressure from stakeholders, firms with activities that are more aggressive to the natural environment will try to signal stakeholders that they follow adequate sustainable practices through adequate sustainability disclosure (Campbell, 2003; Liu and Anbumozhi, 2009; Dyduch and Krasodomska, 2017).

In Brazil, it is important to evaluate the role played by firm industry environmental risk on CSP, given the raising relevance devoted to this issue since the enactment of important legal instruments. It is important to mention the Brazilian Environmental Policy Law 6,938/1981 (revised by Law 10,165/2000), and the Brazilian Constitution/1988 are influential legal

instruments that highlighted the importance of firm environmental concerns. Both these influential legal instruments highlighted the importance of firms’ environmental concerns. The enactment of Law 10.165/2000 was a threshold for firms’ environmental concerns in Brazil by stratifying firm industry under environmental risk layers (low, medium and high), establishing the Control and Environmental Inspection Fee for all firms from stratified sectors, and also by compelling stratified firms to report annual activities to the government.

Firm’s relation with the government and with the natural environment is crucial under the stakeholder theoretical framework. Thus, together with increasing social pressures, Brazilian institutional setting has faced advances in environmental legislation to impose stricter rules on firms in relation with the natural environment. The advances in legal rules, associated with local and international social pressures, tend to force firms to be more committed to environmental, social and sustainability issues which may also be reflected in the search for higher CSP and positive visibility through the presence in sustainability indices as proposed in the following hypothesis:

# H2.

Firms from environmental risky industries are more prone to have higher CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.

The stakeholder theory proposes the virtuous cycle between social responsibility and firm performance under the rationale that social responsibility actions are able to create value for the firm because society has a positive sensitivity to this type of corporate action (Freeman et al., 2004; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Stakeholder theorists indeed contend that under the perspective that the firm must be concerned with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, the company must look for maximizing not only shareholders’ interests but also all other stakeholders’ interests, which may be achieved through the commitment to ESG issues that are related to a wider range of stakeholders. They advocate that such commitment is able to foster the virtuous cycle between social responsibility and firm’s performance.

In fact, prior research on the relationship between CSP and firm profitability has seen it as dynamic with results revealing profitability as a determinant of CSP and also the opposite (Garcia-Castro et al., 2010; McGuirre et al., 1988). Thus, firm’s perspective is expanded by integrating an ethical and responsible conduct (Harrison et al., 2010). Such ethical conduct has been seen as able to improve firm’s image and create value in the mid- and long-run by promoting a virtuous cycle between firm and its stakeholders, favoring firm’s market share and competitive advantage (Waddock and Graves, 1997; Orlitzky et al., 2003).

The argument about the effect of profitability on sustainability is associated with the fact that firms with higher profitability, under the financial slack resources theoretical framework, tend to have more funds available to undertake social and environmental actions (Husted and Salazar, 2006; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Following this argument, it seems appropriate to hypothesize that profitability contributes to higher CSP:

# H3.

Profitability has a positive effect on CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.

Firm size has often been suggested as able to moderate firm social and sustainability policies and, indeed, it has been used as an important control variable in this context, although the arguments about the possible effect of firm size on these policies are still controversial (Baumann-Pauly et al., 2013; Orlitzky, 2001; Udayasankar, 2008). It is postulated that larger firms are able to provide more resources to support firm’s social and sustainability policy. Additionally, as the firm becomes larger, it interacts with a wider scope of stakeholders and, this way, experiences greater appeal for ESG concerns. In this vein, such concerns tend to be more relevant to larger firms which are more compelled to follow ethical behavior and integrate better corporate governance practices (Ullman, 1985; Ziegler and Schro¨ der, 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013). Following this rationale, we propose that larger firms are more prone to be committed with sustainability issues as summarized in the following hypothesis:

# Larger firms are more likely to have higher CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.

There are arguments suggesting that innovation process, which is closely related to growth opportunities, is positive to the firm production system by making it more effective, given that innovation leads to optimizing the consumption of energy and natural resources, and thus reducing its effect on the natural environment. This may lead to better corporate sustainability related to products and processes (Padgett and Galan, 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Artiach et al., 2010). Besides, firm’s growth opportunities have been considered to be related to firm’s commitment to sustainability given that the firm needs to signal to the market that it is sustainable to be able to access external funds to seize its growth opportunities. Thus, to better maximize its growth opportunities, which is closely related to innovation process that is beneficial to firm’s sustainability, the firm needs to show that it is committed to sustainability in terms of natural environment concerns, stakeholder management and business ethics, which involves good standards of corporate governance, adequate relations with clients and supply chain and natural environment concerns. This rationale motivates the following hypothesis:

# H5. Growth opportunities have a positive influence on the CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.

Creditors are usually effective in pressing for the meeting of their demands, as they finance firm’s investment and need guarantees for the return of their funds. This situation sometimes leads to firm monitoring if the firm increases its indebtedness (Artiach et al., 2010). Thus, in low leveraged firms, creditors exert less pressure over their rights. On the other hand, more indebted firms are more committed to creditor rights. The financial obligations with creditors may lead to reduced slack resources and to lower firm’s capacity to undertake social and sustainability actions which require available funds, constraining the firm to direct funds to CSR activities (Brammer and Pavelin, 2008). These arguments lead to the hypothesis proposal that debt may inhibit firm sustainability policy as follows:

# H6. Debt has a negative influence on the CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index.

# 3. Empirical research

# 3.1 Sample

The sample is composed of 2,685 firm-year observations from 327 firms, covering the period of 2006-2015. The year 2006 corresponds to the first year of the Brazilian Firm ISE. Firms financial and ownership data were obtained from Economatica database. Every firm’s sector was checked in Law 10.165/2000 to categorize each one according to the industry environmental risk. The status of composing the annual ISE, that is the proxy for higher CSP, was collected at the ISE website at BM&FBOVESPA. The sample period is also relevant given that it allows assessing the effect of the financial crisis (2007-2009) on CSP and eventual recovery in the aftermath. The whole sample of firms is distributed among several sectors of the economy (Table I). As can be observed in Table I, membership to the ISE seems to attract firms from all industries. It is worth mentioning that three sectors – “Chemicals, paper products, metal-mechanical”, “Financial” and “Electrical, Water supply and sanitary services” – exhibit higher proportions of firms in the ISE than out of it. This can be motivated by characteristics of firms’ interests on positive visibility and also because of industry regulation. For example, in Brazil, the National Agency of Electrical Energy establishes specific sustainability guidelines for the energy sector (Braga et al., 2014).

# 3.2 Models and method

The difficulties in finding adequate measures for firms social and sustainability concerns are probably because of the diversity of actions a firm may undertake in such framework, the

absence of uniform disclosure format and also its non-mandatory nature (Orlitzky et al., 2003; Aguinis and Glavas, 2012). Sustainability concerns are associated with firm’s environmental concerns and also with firm’s capacity to maintain performance and competitive advantage which may be dependent on good management and corporate governance practices, which signals the relevance given to the economic pillar of sustainability (Moldan et al., 2012). All this means that CSP indices are subject to complex measuring strategies as can be seen in the multiplicity of indices used (Li and Tang, 2007; Hodgson et al., 2011).

This work uses the membership to the Brazilian Firm ISE as proxy for the level of firm CSP given that it integrates CSR and sustainability concerns. The annual membership to the ISE is the dependent variable (CSP) in the logit panel data model of equation (1):

CSPi;t = b0 + b1 OWNCi;t + b2 RSKINDi;t + b3 ROAi;t + b4 SIZE + b5 GOPPi;t + dt + ai + mi;t (1)

In model of equation (1), the dummy variable CSP, is set to 1 if firm i is present in the ISE at year t, meaning high CSP, and 0 otherwise. OWNC is a measure of ownership concentration in hands of the first up to the fifth main stockholder. It corresponds to the voting capital held by the main stockholder (OWNC1), the sum of voting capital in hands of the two main stockholders (OWNC2) and so forth up to the sum of voting stocks held by the five main stockholders (OWNC5). Additionally, for sensitivity analysis, we also estimate alternate logit panel data models. First, we use the annual Herfindahl index of voting ownership concentration in hands of the five main voting shareholders for each firm-year observation (HI5). The Herfindahl index corresponds to the sum of squares of voting stocks held by each of the five main shareholders following previous literature (Maury and Pajuste, 2005). Second, we use a dummy variable for the presence of a dominant controlling shareholder, i.e. a stockholder that holds more than 50 per cent of voting capital (MAJOR).

Environmental risky industry (RSKIND) was taken into account based on the Brazilian Law for the Natural Environment (Law 10.165/2000). Such law created a fee for environmental control and inspection that are to be paid by firms from environmental risky industries. Law 10.165/2000 lists which are those environmental risky industries in terms of the potential to damage the natural environment. Thus, RSKIND is a dummy variable that is set to 1 if the firm sector is in the list of environmental risky industries, and is set to 0 otherwise.

Growth opportunities (GOPP) is proxied by Tobin’s q which is calculated as the ratio between firm’s market value plus debt, and firm’s accounting value, as usual in the literature (Villalonga and Amit, 2006). Return on assets (ROA) proxies for firm’s profitability. Finally,

also as common in the literature, natural logarithm of firm’s total assets is used as proxy for firm’s size (SIZE). In equations (1) and (2), i refers to firm; t is related to period; dt is the error term related to time-specific effects; ai is the error term associated with firm-specific effects (which includes unobservable firm-specific characteristics); and mi,t is the random error term.

Alternate models [equation (2)] include the variable firm debt (DEBT), being measured by the ratio of total debt over total assets. These logit panel data models (for all measures of ownership concentration) are estimated for the subsample of non-financial firms, for which debt emerges as an important control variable commonly mentioned in the literature.

CSPi;t = b0 + b1 OWNCi;t + b2 RSKINDi;t + b3 ROAi;t + b4 SIZE + b5 GOPPi;t + b5 DEBTi;t + dt + ai + mi;t (2)

Models are estimated using panel data logistic regression model (“xtlogit” command in STATA). Panel data methodology allows the treatment of unobservable heterogeneity associated with fixed firm effects which are those specific firm attributes that do not change over time. With the purpose of having robust results, we kept in the panel data only firms with at least four years of available data. Description of models variables are summarized in Table II trying to make it clearer.

Notes: Test for the difference in proportions indicates that the number of firms in each situation are not balanced (x2 test, p-value = 0.000). Worth noting is that 59.81 per cent of firms from environmental risky industries.

cent of firm-year observations (1,606) are from environmental risky industries which means that Brazilian legislation has expanded more effective environmental control to a broad spectrum of industries. Among the firms that are members of the ISE sustainability index, the highest proportion is relative to environmental risky industries (73.15 per cent), while only 26.85 per cent are from other industries. That is a strong indication in the direction of H2 which predicts that firms from environmental risky industries are more prone to have greater CSP.

Results for model estimates of equation (1) for the whole sample are exhibited in Table V. Alternate models that include debt as explanatory variable were estimated for the subsample of non-financial firms (Table VI).

As hypothesized, voting ownership concentration of the Brazilian firm negatively affects its CSP, proxied by the probability of the firm being in the ISE index (Table V) (H1). This result is consistent to models estimated with different measures of ownership concentration, i.e. the presence of a major controlling shareholder (MAJOR) (Table V, column i), the sum of voting stocks in hands of the first up to the three main shareholders (OWNC1 to OWNC3) (Table V, columns iii, iv and v) and also by the Herfindahl index among the five main stockholders (HI5) (column ii). Taking into account that CSP includes ESG concerns such result is consistent with the argument that large controlling shareholders of the Brazilian firm may not see sustainability concerns as so relevant. Together, corporate governance and the economic pillar of sustainability are very important in the ISE index (approximately 30 per cent of the questionnaire). The high importance of corporate governance concerns embedded in the ISE sustainability index may be relevant for this inverse relation given that prior literature has pointed out ownership concentration is associated to weaker corporate governance (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997; Hu and Izumida, 2008; Branda˜ o and Crisostomo, 2015). Under the agency theoretical framework, this situation may contribute to a rise in agency conflicts among controlling, minority and external stakeholders. It is also noticed that the negative effect of ownership concentration over CSP is absent when considering.

Dependent variable is the dummy variable CSP that is assigned 1 if the firm i is listed at the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA (ISE) in the year t and 0 otherwise. HI5 is the Herfindahl index for voting ownership concentration held by the five main shareholders. OWNC (1-5) refers to the sum of voting shares (%) held by the main one up to the five main shareholders. ROA is return on assets. GOPP stands for growth opportunities, proxied by Tobin’s q. SIZE (Ln of total assets) proxies for firm size. DEBT is leverage measured as total debt divided by total assets; , and  refer to 1, 5 and 10% significance levels, respectively ownership concentration is in hands of the four and five main shareholders (OWNC4 to OWNC5) (Table IV, columns vi and vii). That means that higher voting concentrated ownership among the four and five main large shareholders may signal that the presence of more than three large blockholders is able to reduce the detrimental effect of up to three controlling shareholders on sustainability performance. This finding is in the direction of the contest power of blockholders over the excess power of one or two large controlling shareholders (Jara-Bertin et al., 2008). Besides the contest power, this could also be because of advances in blockholders’ sensitivity to CSR issues in more recent periods because of local and global institutional pressures.

As proposed under the rationale of H2, an important firm attribute – the firm pertinence to an environmental risky industry (RSKIND) – may be an important determinant for the degree of firm CSP. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries seem to be more committed to social and sustainability issues signaling that such firms believe that higher CSP is an important instrument to improve firm reputation and legitimacy of its activities. The activities undertaken by such firms to manage environmental concerns may probably increase their punctuation in ISE’s inquire at the same time that these firms are probably struggling to be a member of the annual ISE list as a way to show that they are actually concerned with sustainability issues. In fact, a detailed analysis of membership to the ISE sustainability index shows that firms seem to make an effort to be at the ISE index as depicted by the presence of firms in consecutive years. Among these persistent firms, many of them are from environmental risky industries, as is the case of AES ELETROPAULO, CEMIG, CPFL ENERGIA and BRASKEM which were present in ten periods at ISE, or GERDAU and SUZANO PAPEL which were at the ISE index in nine periods (Crisostomo et al., 2018).

Contrary to our expectation, profitability is not a determinant for the degree of CSP (H3). In fact, the set of results in the literature are not conclusive about this effect. Perhaps, the

Financial slack resources proposal may not hold for the Brazilian firm given that it faces financial constraints for investment (Crisostomo et al., 2014; Bassetto and Kalatzis, 2011) which may signal the absence of slack resources that could be used to fund social and sustainability activities. Other firm attributes have shown to be able to affect CSP. In fact, firm size has a positive effect over CSP as argued under H4, supporting the suggestion that larger firms are more capable of addressing social and sustainability concerns given that they tend to have more resources available for that (Udayasankar, 2008). Firm growth opportunities also have a positive effect over CSP as proposed under the rationale of H5 that the need to seize growth opportunities will require more firm commitment to social and sustainability concerns, as well as with good corporate governance practices, given that this may be relevant in the search for funds to finance firms’ investment projects.

The alternate models estimated for the subsample of non-financial firms with the debt variable (DEBT) included as an explanatory variable are shown in Table VI. As can be derived from models coefficients, the aforementioned results were confirmed. In fact, firms from environmental risky industries (RSKIND) present higher probability of being a leading CSP firm. High ownership concentration indeed has a negative effect on firm’s CSP and the absence of such adverse effect for the concentration in hands of the main four and five shareholders (OWNC4 and OWNC5) signal that more large shareholders are able to minimize such negative effect on firm’s social and sustainability concerns (Table VI, columns vi and vii). The same result holds for larger firms and firms with more growth opportunities.

As hypothesized, growth opportunities have a positive effect on Brazilian firm CSP proxied by the firm pertinence to the ISE index. Indeed, a firm with more growth opportunities needs all available funds to maximize them. For so, the firm must signal that it ratifies good corporate governance practices and has sustainability as a relevant concern. This is crucial in the financial market. This finding of the positive influence of growth opportunities on CSP is in accordance with previous results (Artiach et al., 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Ziegler and Schro¨der, 2010).

The positive effect of firm size on CSP of Brazilian firm follows the theoretical proposal that larger firms are more able to undertake social responsibility actions (CSR) and, in parallel, are required to show more high standards of sustainability concerns. This finding is also consistent with previous studies in different markets, including Brazil (Artiach et al., 2010; Lourenc¸o and Castelo Branco, 2013; Nunes et al., 2010).

Contrary to the expected negative effect, there is no effect of debt over CSP according to the results. In fact, debt costs and possible undesirable external control from creditors does not seem to adversely affect CSP. That could be because of the fact that more concern on firm sustainability is suggested to be positive to external financing given that the funding market may take such concern into account when analyzing firm funding requests (Magnanelli and Izzo, 2017; Brammer and Pavelin, 2008). This conflicting situation between favorable and unfavorable effect of debt over CSP may lead to the absence of association between debt and an index that incorporates CSR and sustainability.

Additional models were estimated to assess whether the financial crisis (2007-2009) which affected many countries, was able to deter CSP of Brazilian firms given its potential to decrease firms’ financial performance with possible negative effect on CSP. Table VII summarizes results of model estimates that integrate period dummy variables that refer to the periods before, during and after crisis. The findings signal that indeed the crisis period had an adverse effect on CSP (Table VII; Panel A). Mainly, important is that in the period after crisis there has been observed a strong trend for improvement in Brazilian firms’ CSP (Table VII; Panel B).

Overall, the findings show that indeed firm membership to an environmental risky industry is an important firm attribute for higher public accountability and better CSP. In fact, Brazilian

Notes: Estimates obtained from panel data logistic model. Dependent variable is the dummy variable CSP that is assigned 1 if the firm i is listed at the Corporate Sustainability Index of BM&FBOVESPA (ISE) in the year t and 0 otherwise. HI5 is the Herfindahl index for voting ownership concentration held by the five main shareholders. OWNC (1- 5) refers to the sum of voting shares (%) held by the main one up to the five main shareholders. ROA is return on assets. GOPP stands for growth opportunities, proxied by Tobin’s q. SIZE (Ln of total assets) proxies for firm size; and refer to 1, 5 and 10% significance levels, respectively firms from environmental risky industries seem to be more eager to undertake social and sustainability actions as can be depicted from their strong presence at the ISE sustainability index. Additional evidence is provided about the adverse effect of high ownership concentration of Brazilian firms on CSP, revealing that large controlling shareholders are not so concerned with ESG issues. Perhaps, the great proportion of corporate governance and economic dimensions of the ISE index may be driving this result taking into account that previous literature has found important negative effect of ownership concentration over corporate governance (La Porta et al., 1998; Branda˜ o and Crisostomo, 2015). Worth noting is the new evidence provided that more large blockholders seem to be able to reduce this negative influence of high ownership concentration over CSP which may signal the existence of an initial contest power in this specific firm policy. It is important to note the relevance of firm size and growth opportunities in improving CSP, and that the

macroeconomic conditions during the international financial crisis (2007-2009) had adverse effect on Brazilian firms’ CSP. Table VIII summarizes all results found trying to leave it clearer.

# 5. Conclusions

The increasing relevance of CSP, which comprises ESG concerns, on business practices, has motivated research about its drivers. In this context, this work analyzes CSP determinants in an important emerging market, Brazil. CSP is proxied by the firm’s annual membership to the Brazilian ISE. Firm’s presence in the ISE index is conditioned on a tough competition among firms that fulfill a specific questionnaire comprising seven dimensions of corporate, social and sustainability concerns. A new large panel data set of Brazilian firms for the period of 2006-2015 was built, containing 2,685 firm-year observations with at least four years of observations for each firm.

Literature has suggested a set of firm attributes as able to affect firm CSP, as for example, firm size, firm performance, industry environmental sensitivity and ownership structure. This work provides evidence that firms from environmental risky industries are found to be leading CSP firms given that they have higher probability to be present in the Brazilian ISE. This reality shows that indeed firm’s industry environmental sensitivity is relevant to CSP. This may be a consequence of stakeholders’ pressure and institutional advances achieved in Brazilian Law for the Natural Environment which may be leading to positive enforcement results. It is important to highlight the negative effect of macroeconomic conditions during the financial crisis (2007-2009) on Brazilian firm CSP and that in the aftermath when such adverse situation seems to have faced a reversion.

Under the agency theoretical framework, high firm ownership concentration is proposed as able to align the principal and agent interests, at the same time that may favor the interests of controlling shareholders who become powerful enough to influence important firm policies, including social and sustainability responsibilities. The excess power of large

|Hypothesis|Finding|
|---|---|
|H1: Ownership concentration has an adverse effect on the probability of the firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index which signals firm CSP|Supported (negative effect found)|
|H2: Firms from environmental risky industries are more prone to have higher CSP which is signaled by firm’s membership to the ISE sustainability index|Supported (positive effect found)|

Blockholders has grounded the stakeholder framework used in this research that has documented an adverse effect of ownership concentration on Brazilian firm CSP. This result signals that controlling shareholders may not see the whole set of social and sustainability issues as a priority. It is important to highlight the new finding that more large stockholders appear to be able to contest the excess power of controlling blockholders and reduce the negative impact of high ownership concentration over CSP, signaling an emerging contest power in this context. Besides, larger Brazilian firms and the ones with more growth opportunities seem to be more committed to undertaking social and sustainability actions.

The contribution of the work is twofold and may be of interest to distinct constituencies. The research analyzes the composition of the ISE index (Brazilian ISE) which indeed integrates ESG concerns. For researchers, the index analysis is important given its relevance nowadays when social concerns in general have gained importance in financial markets. Starting from the ISE index analysis, the work provides additional evidence on the firm’s attributes that influence CSP, as proxied by membership to the ISE index. Similar research may be undertaken in other markets using similar methodology, given that indices such as ISE do not publicize firm punctuation.

New relevant evidence is provided about the fact that firms from environmental risky industries are linked to higher probability of composing the sustainability index and thus to higher standards of social and sustainability activities. This finding builds on stakeholder theory by highlighting positive results from the Brazilian environmental legislation, being an important discovery to both environmentalists and academics. The analysis of how voting ownership concentration affects firm’s CSP builds on both agency and stakeholder theories by exposing agency conflicts and stakeholders’ interests. This examination provides evidence that CSP is negatively affected by high ownership concentration in Brazil, in accordance with prior results but also pointing out the new finding that the presence of other large shareholders, who are associated to more ownership dispersion, seem to be able to contest the power of large controlling blockholders.

The paper concludes highlighting the importance of enforcing corporate social and sustainability institutionalization in Brazil. The positive effects obtained from the advances in environmental legislation must be taken into account to foster strengthening in other dimensions of CSP such as the relations with employees and civil society. Policymakers ought to observe society demands and the need to preserve the natural environment. In this regard, the encouragement of civil society to pressure government and firms for better CSP is very relevant.

The present findings are relevant to the ongoing debate on the importance of CSP and firms’ attributes that influence on it. Thus, this work meets the request from international audience for this kind of research in emerging economies which present distinct institutional environments and incipient capital markets. The results refer to the 9a economy in the world that is a BRIC member.

Some research lines are identified. Analyzing the seven ISE axes separately may be considered a limitation of this work while it is a challenge for future research. Studying the effect of other aspects of Brazilian firms’ ownership structure also emerges as another insightful research as is the case of controlling blockholders’ nature. Specific works may also try to capture the capacity of civil society organizations to pressure for CSP advances.

# Abstract

Corporate sustainability is considered a fundamental paradigm and solution in creating a prosperous future for organizations. However, social sustainability issues and pandemic problems from COVID-19 have affected corporations and interrupted plans for sustainable development. To date, corporate sustainability frameworks have taken a relatively narrow view of this paradigm. This study highlights serious challenges to corporate sustainability while providing a framework in an attempt to enable more sustainable business practices. To fill the gap in the literature, we have developed a framework to organize and prioritize important sustainability indicators. The first phase of the study involves the classification of 45 sub-criteria of corporate sustainability under nine main categories by using a literature review and novel Fuzzy Delphi method. The resulting categories are Corporate Governance, Product Responsibility, Transparency and Communication, Economic, Environmental, Social, Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability, Energy Consumption along with Energy Saving, and includes Pandemic COVID-19 as a new aspect of social sustainability. Next, we applied the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) to help determine the weights and prioritizing the criteria and sub-criteria. The results revealed that the Pandemic, along with the Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability, ranked higher among the main criteria category. Whereas, emergency response planning, social distances, modification of working hours, and just-in-time delivery are the most influencing sub-attributes among the 45 sub-barriers of different categories. Contributions of this study include new insights regarding corporate sustainability criteria and subcriteria, application of novel methods, and integrated framework for dimensions of corporate sustainability. This study is among the first of its kind to consider the COVID-19 pandemic as an essential category and social sustainability attribute of corporate sustainable business practices. Outcomes of this study can help assist scholars, corporations, and decision-makers in understanding sustainable development initiatives while simultaneously improving social sustainability practices.

# 1. Introduction

Sustainable development is the potential to fulfill today’s needs without undermining a future generation’s ability to satisfy their needs [1]. Sustainability has become a significant alternative to business as usual, which appears to focus primarily on short-term productivity with little or no social and environmental impacts considered over the long term [2]. Despite this, the business environment

www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability

Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

is changing rapidly, guided by social, economic, and ecological developments [3, 4]. For these and other aligned reasons, companies have become increasingly interested in corporate sustainability; see, for example, Christ et al. [5] and Manrique and Martí-Ballester [6]. While managers have noticed that the integration of sustainability is an opportunity, they rarely consider it in tactical management decisions [7]. The consideration of sustainability in corporate strategy and processes has become one promising way of dealing with a changing business landscape and increasing pressure for social sustainability performance. Since decisions relating to sustainability are made at a strategic level, there has also been an increasing scientific interest in the field of strategic management in connection with the inclusion of sustainability in the strategy, vision, change management, and culture of a company [8].

Due to the variety of different sustainability initiatives, there is an ongoing opportunity for researchers to quantify what ongoing and emerging practices look like [9]. Yet, there has been so much published by researchers that it can be an overwhelming amount of information to sort through. Add to this, the idea that stakeholders are continually seeking more information beyond financial performance by wanting to see the ecological and social policies of a company [10], and the importance of understanding corporate sustainability continues to grow. Corporate sustainability reporting can be a primary motivation for organizations to communicate with stakeholders about sustainability initiatives. This gets difficult due to the terminology and growing categories of these diverse efforts. For example, firms have been reporting the use of different terminologies, e.g., corporate social responsibility (CSR), sustainable development (SD), economic and non-economic reporting, and referring to the main pillars of sustainability which are social, environmental, and economic (SEE), and triple bottom line (TBL). The evolution of such reporting is fascinating. Tschopp and Huefner [11] found that the companies were focusing on environmental management compliance reporting during the 1970s and 1980s, and they also observed a weak relation between sustainability reporting and organization performance. Later, in the 1990s, sustainability reporting on occupational health and safety (OHS) was observed, and a paradigm shift to reporting on societal-based activities, accompanied by institutionalization.

Considering that each participant in society has its unique responsibility to engage sustainable development at a global scale, corporate sustainability reflects the organizations’ part to global challenges of sustainable development [12], including depletion of natural resources and social sustainability. There are several challenges regarding corporate sustainability, such as the need for considering both external and internal stakeholders in corporate decisions [13]; to resolve discrepancies, contradictions, and synergies among the three pillars of TBL sustainability [14]; to promote an approach to corporate sustainability based in moral-values [15]; to foster corporate social responsibility across the business life-cycle thinking [16]. Add to this, the several contributions available in the literature from different epistemological fields connected with environmental, economic, and social performance, and it seems evident that there is an absence of coordination among them. Diouf et al. [17] emphasized the growing significance of sustainability reporting and the use of international regulations, targets for reducing carbon emissions, and international standards and guidelines. Arribas et al. [18] investigated that the inclusion of irresponsible companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) from S&P Dow Jones Indices, and Social Accountability (SA8000) from Social Accountability International—SAI (2008) is a fact.

Those who manage business decisions face multiple criteria for achieving the best practices while trying to achieve multiple goals. Decisions regarding sustainable business practices have multi-level characteristics as TBL dimensions can be broken down into hierarchical variables [19]. One primary objective of this study is to help researchers and practitioners identify essential corporate sustainability criteria. Therefore, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is recommended for simultaneously addressing decisions with multiple objectives and multiple criteria. Multi-criteria decision theory helps to orchestrate the various awareness of practices involving sustainability [20] and to help when making decisions regarding dynamic topics. Multi-stakeholder, multi-objective, and multi-level frameworks have been developed and utilized in the literature to assess corporate sustainability results but, so far,

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

the initiatives have not provided a consistent, single measure capturing the TBL’s complexities and integrating the MCDA. Therefore, the second objective of this study is to provide a methodology to help organize and understand this dynamic context for sustainable business practices.

Add to this dynamic context, a global pandemic and things can get interesting. Due to the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak, the modern world is suffering a global economic crisis with well over 9 million cases, and over 501,000 fatalities as of September 2020 affecting more than 200 countries [21]. Many businesses have shut down, and the rate of unemployment has increased. According to the World Health Organization, COVID-19 has become an unparalleled global crisis and is challenging organizations, which ultimately can have a negative effect on corporate sustainability and business practices [22]. Until now, corporations have not had to plan for a pandemic. Moreover, corporate sustainability has been marginalized due to organizations, governments, and society struggling to survive in times of a pandemic. Researchers have stated that the COVID-19 pandemic is opening new challenges for corporate sustainability, mainly because supply chains and their manufacturers are facing the pandemic’s negative effects, such as market downturn, SMEs bankruptcy, employees’ resignations, revenue loss, to name a few. Therefore, we see the post-COVID-19 era as an opportunity by which organizations can rethink their sustainable business practices concerning a shift in their manufacturing, supply chain, and sustainability strategies. Here we find the third objective for this study to extend our understanding of corporate sustainability by also exploring the more recent impacts of the pandemic.

Researchers, policymakers, and decision-makers are now more concerned about how to make corporations more sustainable. This study is an attempt to help decision-makers and researchers by developing a framework for corporations regarding social sustainability dimensions that include COVID-19 as a new attribute of sustainable business practices. Many aspects of corporate sustainability can be measured to calculate the company’s sustainability efficiency. In this study of corporate sustainability, we assess this paradigm using (i) Governance; (ii) Product Responsibility; (iii) Transparency and Communication; (iv) Economic; (v) Environmental; (vi) Social; (vii) Natural Environment and Climate Vulnerability; (viii) Energy Consumption and Saving, and a new criterion, (ix) Pandemic COVID-19. These nine aspects are further divided into forty-five sub-criteria. In doing so, one contribution of this study is the addition of values for these major criteria and sub-criteria as we attempt to fill a gap in the corporate sustainability literature. As a partial response to the recent and growing call for understanding the pandemic COVID-19 effects on businesses, the authors conducted this research aiming to contribute to the growing literature on the topic by developing a multidimensional framework for corporate sustainability. Further, this study prioritizes the main and sub-attributes of an emerging sustainability model by being among the first to use MCDA techniques.

To help start us down a path to understanding this dynamic context for corporate sustainability, fundamental factors can be identified from the literature and further classified as a foundation for understanding corporate sustainability. In this study, we draw from the literature to develop lists of main and sub-attributes essential for developing corporate sustainability business practices. Building on our objectives for this study, our primary research questions include, but are not limited, to what are the most influenceable metrics for corporate sustainability? And how can they be evaluated and ranked in a way that provide value to practitioners and scholars? After reviewing the literature, conceptual models, our research framework, and applying a Fuzzy Delphi method, we assess nine sustainability criteria and forty-five sub-criteria. We review our methods for employing the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) for calculations of weights for both the sub-criteria using a matrix of pairwise comparisons. Results are then discussed, and the last section provides main conclusions, contributions to the field, and avenues for aspects of corporate sustainability, social sustainability, and sustainable development for future researches.

# 2. Literature Review

The definitions of sustainability have many interpretations, such as environmental protection, ecosystem resources, economic concerns, social acceptance, licensing and externalities, and many other perspectives. The recent literature shows that sustainable development is going beyond “green” to a more comprehensive, systematic, methodological, and integrated understanding of sustainability. Researchers and decision-makers are aware of the need for systematic sustainability assessments to evaluate complex systems to replace traditional and unsustainable business practices. Such assessments ultimately concentrate on historical strategies for sustainability, demonstrating the need to improve corporate sustainability programs over time, along with allocating resources that reduce sustainability risks. Further, organizations need to combine efficiency and market performance initiatives to develop strategic corporate sustainability opportunities [23].

Asif et al. [24], conceptualized the integration of economic, social, and environmental bottom lines dimension by using a triple bottom line. This view of a corporation means that the efficiency and sustainability aspects of the integrated structure are matched together. Several models have been proposed to develop corporate sustainability in efforts to make it accessible, practical, and quantifiable. The wide range of sustainability frameworks is because of the variety of definitions of sustainable development, i.e. ecological sustainability, environmental efficiency, corporate citizenship, and TBL. In prior studies, one dimension of corporate sustainability is evaluated to define, measure, and sometimes test constructs and relationships. For instance, environmental sustainability frameworks concentrate on environmental issues by providing metrics for mitigating pollution, climate vulnerability, environmental degradation, land use, and loss of biodiversity [25].

Social sustainability models focus on societal and ethical facets of corporate sustainability, such as infrastructure, community welfare, human rights, health, equity, and education [26]. Further, economic sustainability involves the economic structure of organizations and concentrates on businesses seeking to optimize the company’s resources through social and environmental strategies [27]. Some studies proposed the two-dimensional sustainability frameworks in which two or more dimensions of corporate sustainability (such as environmental and social dimensions evaluated by providing sustainability indices and MCDA approaches). The fundamental model of corporate sustainability is shown in Figure 1.

Concerns regarding the social and environmental effects of sustainability must be weighted, but economic viability should not be threatened. The company’s financial performance can be affected and impacts its risk of survival if it fails to give due attention to its economic performance [28]. Longoni and Cagliano [29] argued that managing and balancing TBL performance is paramount. The authors acknowledge the difficulties of doing this while also trying to understand any negative tradeoffs between the three sustainability dimensions.

The International Organization of Standardization (ISO) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) systems assist companies in integrating sustainable development and TBL performance. GRI measures and reports the “material” performance of companies and its business activities and its effectiveness in multiple dimensions, i.e., three folds result to the public, most of the time through sustainability reports [30]. Several sustainability indices have been developed to highlight sustainability activities so that investors can consider the sustainable performance of enterprises. By analyzing the sustainability practices by each corporation, the sustainability indices act as a knowledge intermediary of companies with their different players (including business specialists, shareholders, and financial intermediaries). Specialized data accessed by neutral parties are seen by these intermediaries as objective. Conventional definitions of sustainability suggest that the businesses are supposed to be listed only if they are more socially and environmentally responsible than their competitors within these stock indexes. Sustainability stock indexes can, therefore, be treated as suitable sustainability performance indicators. Weber [31] suggests sustainability guidance that describes the most relevant performance metrics and issues in six banking industries. They showed specific important issues are shared by many industries, particularly social sustainability aspects, whereas others are unique in a sector.

Several researchers have used MCDA methods to measure the company’s sustainability performance. A list of different MCDA approaches used to develop a sustainability framework is shown in Table 1.

Previously, before the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations, governments, and society were dealing with and focusing on environmental issues. It is believed that, after the COVID-19 pandemic, business transitions will increase in order to achieve a more sustainable corporate sustainability. This transition will allow organizations to develop flexible manufacturing systems, prioritizing environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Regarding decision support systems for resilient production, there are various options available, such as those proposed by Tan et al. [52] and the prediction model for supply chains of Ivanov et al. [53]. Thus, companies and supply chains need to be resilient to tackle tough times, such as what occurs during the current pandemic.

As expected, the economic crisis that followed the COVID-19 epidemic affected several businesses, from manufacturers to service providers due to the social distancing and lockdowns [54]. Thus, the businesses in which customers interact with each other were immediately stopped [55, 56]. To avoid bankruptcy, these businesses moved to palliative solutions aiming for their survival, mainly migrating the businesses to digital platforms [57].

The epidemic effects on delivery delays are affecting supply chains, causing bullwhip effects, and unbalancing organizations’ performances in almost all industries. Thus, companies are focusing on essential items for manufacturing and maintaining supply activities regarding the unexpected disruptions. At the same time, these organizations are planning how to restart the businesses close to the ‘new normal’, as society is returning to (a semi) normality.

The main justification for considering the COVID-19 pandemic effects in corporate sustainability, within this study, is that its consequences will be felt for decades [58]. Thus, as a long-lasting event, it is assumed that the COVID-19 pandemic will affect organizations regarding their sustainability actions in the future.

We considered various decision attributes and indicators for the development of a multidimensional sustainability framework. These attributes can assist in the construction of an effective corporate sustainability model while also providing insights into sustainable business practices. This study develops a decision criterion for sustainable development based on the literature and then checked the criteria validity provided by key expert’s contributions. The main sustainability criteria in our development of a sustainability framework include Corporate Governance, Product Responsibility, Transparency and Communication, Economics, Social, Environmental, Natural Environmental and Climate Change, Energy Saving and Consumption, and what we believe to be used for the first time, the COVID-19 pandemic criteria. As per the best of the authors’ knowledge, pandemic impacts have not been used before in sustainability models to date, the consideration of COVID-19 pandemic effects will help to fulfill a gap in the literature.

Each of these sustainability criteria has a total of forty-five sub-criteria. These criteria were identified after reviewing and summarizing the literature. The results of which criteria and sub-criteria are shown in Table 2. Next, we attempt to extend the corporate sustainability model based on the ‘Plan, Do, Check, and Act’ (PDCA) approach, as presented in Figure 2.

# 3. Research Framework

We have used the Fuzzy Delphi, and FAHP approaches to finalize and prioritize the most important criteria and select sustainability options for the development of corporate sustainability. The framework operationalized in this study is shown in Figure 3. Fuzzy Delphi proposed by Hsu et al. [88] has been adopted in this study to finalize corporate sustainability criteria. The advantage of Fuzzy Delphi over the conventional Delphi method is that the latter is a lengthy process of obtaining a consensus on experts’ opinions. The expert’s opinion in the conventional Delphi method often suffers from low convergence, which ultimately complicates consensus-building. The experts are therefore consulted repeatedly to reform their feedback so that a possible consensus can be reached. On the other hand, Fuzzy Delphi can obtain experts’ consensus through only one round of investigation [89]. The Fuzzy Delphi uses membership functions to characterize the experts’ feedback. In this way, experts are not consulted twice to alter their opinions, which also saves useful information from being lost as all the experts’ opinions are taken while computing the membership degrees.

Regarding the development of the fuzzy membership degrees, most of the previous studies used a Triangular Fuzzy Number (TFN), Gaussian fuzzy number, and trapezoidal fuzzy number [88]. This study employs TFNs, to construct the membership degree function. To find the converging point of the decision group, TFNs were solved using the geometric mean following previous studies such as [90,91]. In taking this approach, a FAHP methodology was used for computing the weights of the main and sub-attributes of corporate sustainability, supported by decision-makers, using a pairwise comparison matrix. To carry out the analysis, eight academic and industrial experts were involved whose detail is provided in Appendix A (see Table A1).

# Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process

The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a well-known and adaptable Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach to solve complex problems used across a variety of fields of research. The logic of AHP is based on a ratio scale to quantify the different sets of alternatives priorities provided by decision-makers [92]. This approach evaluates the consistency and importance of the decision-makers’ instinctive opinions to provide an optimal solution for complex problems. Researchers have integrated the AHP approach with other methods, such as grey system theory, data analysis envelopment, fuzzy system theory, and even linear programming [93].

Although AHP methods have shown satisfactory results and can be used to evaluate decision-makers’ opinions, this technique has some deficiencies in terms of human behavior and thinking approach. Hence, the traditional method has some limitations, such as (i) handling with the inconsistent and unbalanced expert opinion scale, (ii) unable to handle the uncertain and ambiguous relationship with expert’s judgment numbers, (iii) imprecise results, and (iv) decision-makers’ subjective opinion preferences.

Due to these limitations, AHP has evolved into FAHP, as a widely used and more accurate approach over conventional methods to solve uncertain and complex problems involving a decision-maker’s judgment. FAHP is the combination of traditional AHP and Fuzzy set theory, where the membership of each element is represented by a function. Further, each element of the membership function is divided into the membership’s degree with a value between 0 and 1, which implies that any membership’s element has a value of “1”. Conversely, any element has no membership with a “0” value. Those elements which lie between “0 and 1” have a partial or incomplete degree of membership [94]. To effectively handle the uncertainties during the logistic estimation process, there is a need to convert the linguistic term of membership function into ‘fuzzy numbers’, meanwhile, in FAHP, linguistic values are shown as a TFN.

To develop corporate sustainability for the purposes of this study, FAHP was applied to estimate weights of criteria and sub-criteria in the six following steps:

2. Constructing of pairwise comparison matrix and developing the scale of the relative importance

After designing the problem structure in a hierarchical way, the next step is to define the scale of relative importance in order to construct a pairwise comparison matrix. Table 3 presents the TFN, which are from 1 to 9, and are used to improve the accuracy of the traditional model. We employed (˜ 3, 5, 7, 9) relative to correspondence number for expert qualitative assessment in five TFNs in order to capture the vagueness and remove uncertainties. The fuzzy membership for attributes and sub-attributes is shown in Figure 4.

# Step III. Constructing a fuzzy-based matrix for comparison purposes

Experts used the TFNs to elaborate pairwise comparisons of corporate sustainability main and sub-attributes. The fuzzy comparison matrix X was drawn from the expert’s opinions by using the arithmetic mean function for pairwise comparison, as presented in Equation (1).

To make the expert and decision-makers judgments more confident, the α-cut method can be used through the ranking of fuzzy numbers, in which it provides an interval of values based on fuzzy numbers. Figure 5 presented the α-cut method on TFN for this instance, if a = 0.5 will yield a0.5 = (2, 3, 4).

The value of μ index optimism is provided by experts based on the satisfaction degree in the preference matrix. Then, the higher the degree of optimism influenced, the larger the value of μ. Lee et al. [96] introduced the optimism index denoted by ‘μ’ which is linear convex as given in the below equation.

Step V. Consistency check

Step V.The last step explains the consistency of each matrix by using a consistency ratio (CR), and an overall consistency of hierarchy is calculated as well. Meanwhile, the conversion of crisp comparison matrix present by letter ܺ into a consistent fuzzy comparison matrix ܺ෨.

The calculation formula of the largest Eigenvalue is presented in Equation (5).

ܺ                                                                                                                                    ௣        ߣ =୫ୟ୶ ݌                                                                                                                              (5)

In this equation, ݌           represents the principle Eigenvector of the matrix in the above equation.

Equation (5) involves the CR calculation formula through expert pairwise.Xp = λmaxp                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     (5)

Equation (5) involves the CR calculation formula through expert pairwise.

CR = RICI (6)

CI = λmax − nn − 1 (7)

where CI presents the index of consistency, whereas the random index is indicated by RI, and n is the size of the matrix, as presented in Table 4.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|RI|0|0|0.52|0.89|1.11|1.25|1.35|1.40|

The acceptability of CR of any matrix when its value records less than 0.10. Otherwise, the expert’s judgment procedure needs to be revised in the matrix for pairwise comparisons.

# Step VI. Computing attributes weights

The final step describes the calculations of the weights by normalizing the criteria of all the rows and columns of the crisp comparison matrix.

# 4. Results and Discussion

This research used multiple methods to develop a corporate sustainability framework that assists policymakers, government, decision-makers, and managers, to effectively develop sustainability and make better decisions in implementing sustainable business practices. This study is the first of its kind to develop a multidimensional corporate sustainability model based on important sustainability indicators that include pandemic information due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Further, this study identifies and assesses valuable sustainability options retrieved from literature and experts’ knowledge to provide the most suitable sustainability practices for making corporate sustainability resilient. Our investigation is a roadmap for organizations and policymakers in the contemporary world aiming to determine further applications based on our findings, which provides a more rational solution for the development of corporate sustainability.

# 4.1. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process Results

Our analysis started by using the FAHP method based on a pairwise comparison matrix. This matrix was built for determining individual expert scores through a geometric mean approach. The group-based decision-making approach was adopted for calculations of sustainability attributes and sub-attributes weights. Supported by experts and analyzing the related literature review, we can classify nine main sustainability attributes, i.e., Corporate Governance, Environment, Social, Economic, Product Responsibility, Natural Environment and Climate, Energy Consumption and Saving, Transparency and Communication, and COVID-19 pandemic. The first phase of the FAHP method comprises the calculation of the nine most important criteria’s weights and, at the second stage, we determined the 45 sub-attributes weights in total. Figure 6 presents the hierarchal structure of corporate sustainability with the main attributes and sub-attributes.

# 4.2. Prioritizing Main Attributes

The FAHP computed the weight of each sustainability attribute in a hierarchical structure. The main attributes are presented in Table 5 and reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic is the most important criteria by obtaining the highest weight of 0.4129. The importance of criteria were as follows: Economic (0.3754), Corporate Governance (0.2532), Natural Environment and Climate (0.2195),

Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

Environmental (ENV), Energy Consumption and Saving (0.1775), Transparency and Communication (0.1210), Social (0.0542), and Product Responsibility (0.0492) criteria, respectively. The details of each main sustainability indicator’s weights are presented in Table 5. The rapid spreading of the pandemic involving COVID-19 is the most influential barrier disrupting corporate sustainability. The pandemic has affected overall business performances. Economic sustainability and governance was the second most important indicator in our analysis. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects, it brings new challenges for corporations to affect their ability to operationalize sustainability. In addition to new compliance and regulatory parameters, it appears to be a mandatory part of corporate sustainability in the organization. Therefore, corporations need to develop a corporate sustainability system in order to cope with these new issues and enable more sustainable business practices.

# Table 5. Main corporate sustainability attributes.

|Main Criteria|Code|Weight|Rank|
|---|---|---|---|
|Pandemic|PEN|0.4129|1st|
|Corporate Governance|CGOV|0.2532|3rd|
|Product Responsibility|PR|0.0492|9th|
|Transparency and Communication|TC|0.1210|7th|
|Economic|EC|0.3754|2nd|
|Environmental|ENV|0.1871|5th|
|Social|SOC|0.0542|8th|
|Natural Environment & Climate|NEC|0.2195|4th|
|Energy Consumption and Saving|ECS|0.1775|6th|

According to the calculation of the main sustainability attributes’ weights, the Pandemic attribute came first in the main corporate sustainability criteria. To this end, organizations should develop an emergency response plan to tackle any emergency, which may become a hurdle in the effective implementation of corporate sustainability. Hence, organizations should develop a sustainable structure that can prevent the organization from crises. Moreover, organizations should also implement suitable and long-lasting sustainability practices that assure optimal progress toward sustainability and provide benefits while utilizing scarce resources. Further, it was observed that the delivery time of goods supplies has been drastically disrupted due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, organizations need to develop a sustainable delivery system like just-in-time (JIT), which provides a more resilient solution during any emergency faced by the organization. Economic sustainability, governance, and natural environment and climate took their position after the pandemic attribute. Whereas product responsibility came last and observed the least essential attributes by obtaining the lowest weight (0.0492). The 45 sub-attributes of the study were evaluated through with the help of expert’s opinion, according to the pairwise comparisons matrix.

# 4.3. The Prioritizing of Sub-Attributes

The ranking of sub-attributes of corporate sustainability is presented in Figures 7–15.

Governance sub-attributes: We identified the sub-attributes ranking (GOV) as following:

GOV4 > GOV1 > GOV3 > GOV7 > GOV5 > GOV2 > GOV6. Management and audit of corporate governance

(GOV4) obtained the highest score (0.4132) and is considered the main influencing sub-attribute of its category. The outcome proved that face validity is an accurate justification as audit expertise, then skilled personnel are credited for corporate sustainability actions. In the same way, the businesses

# Sustainability 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

Skilled personnel are credited for corporate sustainability actions. In the same way, the businesses must address governance and strengthening it since governance is responsible for guiding companies towards sustainability. Another high score observed with sub-criteria in this category is the corporate governance report (GOV1), with a weight of 0.3884. Corporate award and recognition (GOV3) showed a score of 0.3732, standing at the top-three most important sub-criteria of this category (as seen in Figure 7). Investors are evaluating both economic and financial returns on investments (ROI), but the valuation of investees' reputation is increasing. Then, reputation is positively influenced by corporate sustainability governance at high standards (Gottschalk, 2011). Public Private Partnership on sustainability (GOV7) received a score of 0.2351, putting this sub-attribute at the fourth position of most important sub-attributes. Moreover, corporate governance accountability (GOV5) showed a score of 0.1717, being the fifth most important sub-attribute in this category. The structure and dynamics of corporate governance (GOV2) and conduct and conflict of interest in corporate governance (GOV6) are the least influencing sub-criteria, obtaining the weights of 0.1653 and 0.1089, respectively. The decision for a given company for engaging corporate sustainability governance depends on the achievements of the corporate goals. In this way, [97] underlined that a company’s sustainability is influenced by the stakeholder’s sustainability. Additionally, relations with stakeholders must be considered key for decision-making processes which, in turn, support the establishment of corporate strategies.

|Conflict of interest in corporate governance-GOV6|0.1089|

|Corporate governance report-GOV1|0.3884|
|Management and audit of corporate governance-GOV4|0.4132|

Figure 7. Governance Sub-criteria.

# Product Responsibility

Under the Product responsibility (PR) category, we obtained the following sub-criteria ranking: PR4>PR3>PR5>PR2>PR1, as presented in Figure 8. Product research and development (PR4) is seen as a challenge in supporting the development of corporate sustainability infrastructure, with a score of 0.4102. The next sub-criteria that received the highest score is the compliance with products and policies (PR3) category, with a weight of 0.3297. Product complaint mechanism (PR5) received a score of 0.1737, being the third most important sub-criteria. Following this, indirect impacts of the product (PR2) reached the fourth position (within Product Responsibility category) with a weight of 0.1321. The fifth most important sub-attribute came from the personal impacts of product use (PR1) with a weight of 0.0952. Then, the first phases of product-innovation processes, as well as decision-making processes, must address a sustainability perspective in order to introduce a sustainability paradigm into the business’s practices. Additionally, organizations must incorporate a long-term perspective when considering sustainability as a strategic asset for businesses [98].

# Transparency and Communication

As shown in Figure 9, the ranking of sub-attribute within Transparency and Communication is TC4>TC3>TC1>TC2>TC5, with a consistency ratio of 0.0107. Transparency of general reports (TC4) reached the first position in the Transparency and Communication category, showing a score of 0.4321. Moreover, strategic perspectives after transparency of general reports (TC3) is in the second position, reaching a score of 0.3487. Following, commitments to the community (TC1) and alignment of commitments (TC2) are ranked at the third and fourth.

positions, obtaining a score of 0.2175 and 0.1564, respectively. Finally, ethics and citizenship (TC5) are considered the least influencing sub-criteria with a score of 0.1324. Thus, sustainability supports knowledge creation and sharing, which, in turn, eases communication within organizations. To make a proactive sustainability strategy realistic, Kim and Ji [99] suggested that corporations aiming for a proactive sustainability strategy must consider the communication of a shared vision within an organization and among the company’s stakeholders. When companies communicate their visions related to sustainability, they improve their reputation which increases stakeholders’ interests in such organizations. Moreover, Dyllick and Muff [100] stated that corporate sustainability mission and vision statements should be adopted to convey corporate commitment throughout the corporation.

Results showed that sustainability is directly related to costs (such as costs with audit, training, certification) and indirectly related to operational and social resources, skilled personnel, preventive actions, and regulations adherence. The legal compliance with economic and financial aspects (ECO6) and economic and financial statements (ECO5) is considered at the third and fourth positions within the sub-criteria category of economics with a score of 0.2383 and 0.1894, respectively. Lastly, the development and impact of infrastructure investments (ECO1) and economic and financial policy and strategy (ECO3) with a weight of 0.1765 and 0.1634, respectively. Sustainability actions are the basic elements for putting the economic dimension into practice, and these actions consider profitability, financial stability and liquidity, and financial benefits [101]. Therefore, the CSR spending, the management of innovation and technology, knowledge management, collaborations, organizational processes management, and elaboration of sustainability reports are some of the relevant actions towards corporate sustainability [102].

# Environment

Results showed the ranking within the Environmental dimension of corporate sustainability are as follows: ENV1 > ENV4 > ENV3 > ENV2 > ENV5, as shown in Figure 11. The highest weight, 0.5321, obtained of sub-criteria within the environment category is initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (ENV1). Compliance with environmental regulations (ENV4) reported the second sub-criteria in the row with a weight of 0.4654. Whereas, environmental management and responsibility (ENV3) sub-barrier and commitment, scope, and dissemination of environmental policy (ENV2) are ranked at third and fourth positions, within the environmental sustainability category, presenting a score of 0.3936 and 0.3381, respectively. Finally, environmental cost-saving operations (ENV5) come fifth in the row with a weight of 0.2101. Government regulations have been the primary drivers of a part of corporate sustainability. Literature showed that environmental sustainability provides cost reductions for the businesses, and these reductions are related to the use of energy, raw materials, and water, as well as reducing waste generation. Environmental sustainability improves the company’s reputation for stakeholders and into the market which, in turn, eases acquiring new customers prone to environmental issues. The incorporation of EMS by companies leads to CO2 emission reductions as well as a reduction in pollution [103,104].

# Social

Figure 12 shows the outcomes, ranking the sub-criteria as follows: SOC1 > SOC4 > SOC5 > SOC2 > SOC3. The highest sub-attribute of social criteria is the commitment to societal development (SOC1) with a weight of 0.5464. Training employees through in-house programs (SOC4) is ranked at the second position, presenting a score of 0.4821. Companies must train their personnel to work in an integrated way. Additionally, companies must use integration between auditing services and administration support for building stronger relationships with stakeholders. These relations promote efficiency, may save resources, and provide assertiveness amongst personnel.

# Commitment to HR development-SOC5

0.341

Whereas commitment to HR development (SOC5) is ranked as the third most important sub-criterium, showing a score of 0.3410. Human resources (HR) have a crucial role in the implementation of sustainability by companies [105]. The companies aiming the implementation of sustainability must address the commitment from top managers, supportive actions towards training, personnel empowerment, and teamwork in areas such as Quality Management. Labor relations and with society (SOC2) as well as diversity and equity, supplier management, and resolution of society’s demands (SOC3) are ranked into the fourth and fifth positions, presenting scores of 0.3241 and 0.2146, respectively. Here, we see a strong relationship with suppliers, which emphasizes the need for developing an integrative decision support program for managing the supply chain, taking into account the stakeholders that strategically improve the company’s production processes and balance the supplier sustainability system.

# Natural Environment and Climate:

Under the natural environment and climate change category, results showed in Figure 13 allowed the identification of the following ranking: NEC1>NEC3>NEC2>NEC4. Commitment to climate change (NEC1) is presented as the highest score within sustainability by companies [105]. The companies aiming the implementation of sustainability must address the commitment from top managers, supportive actions towards training, personnel empowerment, and teamwork in areas such as Quality Management. The tree planting program (NEC3) is located in the second position with a 0.5241 score. The responsibility and climate change systems (NEC2) and Issues concerning climate change (NEC4) come in at the third and fourth positions within the category with scores of 0.48521 and 0.3581, respectively. A responsibility attributed to businesses regarding environmental crisis mitigation is crucial, due to these organizations.

Monitoring effective systems. Moreover, climate change is usually considered an important threat in society and nature, more critical than biodiversity loss. Regarding the company’s sustainability performance, the tree planting program (NEC3) is located in the second position with a 0.5241 score. The responsibility and climate change systems (NEC2) and Issues concerning climate change (NEC4) come in at the third and fourth positions within the category with scores of 0.48521 and 0.3581, respectively. A responsibility attributed to businesses regarding environmental crisis mitigation is crucial, due to these organizations possessing greater experience than any other group in society when dealing with such kind of problems. The organization should develop an environment towards a climate-friendly perspective, since climate changes are affecting societies and will affect, as a consequence, companies’ revenues. In this scenario, tougher legislation and binding treaties are needed [106].

Pandemic: Under the Pandemic (PAN) category, results in Figure 14 show the sub-attributes in the following order of importance: PAN1>PAN4>PAN2>PAN3. An emergency response plan (PAN1) obtained the highest weight 0.7646. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, whose major consequences are expected to be revealed in the long-term, results provided a deeper analysis of business risks, which can help organizations to plan accordingly. The organizations should incorporate an emergency plan in order to respond to the pandemic (PAN1), which is considered a community-led initiative based on different scenarios for testing the resilience and the plans addressing the several impacts of the crisis.

Following this, the highest sub-criteria identified is the modification in the number of working hours and social distancing (PAN4) with a weight of 0.6752. Environmental dimensions are the focus of companies and, for this research, organizations are taking several actions to fight the coronavirus outbreak, especially with social distancing and the modification in employee working hours. Organizations should also dedicate focus on their supply chains and on social innovations issues that may result from this pandemic. Results also showed that the JIT as well as lean delivery (PAN2) obtained 0.6241 weight and are in the third position within this category. The pandemic caused by the coronavirus emphasized vulnerabilities related to the overreliance of JIT and lean delivery systems. Additionally, there is a concern about whether JIT systems can contribute to the overall efficiency of resources and waste, in order to transform them into environmentally sound [85].

The growing smarter logistics systems are witnessed by organizations, specifically the consideration of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies applications, and reverse logistics for secondary materials and waste products. Some possible applications of IoT and reverse logistics are addressed. In the first example, monitoring where electronics and appliances and their components are may ease their retrieval and allocation at local levels. As a second example, companies may benefit by using intermediary storage/depots instead of using extensive transportation of processed goods, also favoring reverse logistics. The fourth sub-criteria under the COVID-19 pandemic category, commitment to employee safety (PAN3), has a weight of 0.5354.

# Energy Consumption and Caving

Figure 15 presents the ranking of sub-criteria related to Energy Consumption and Caving to develop corporate sustainability as follows: ECS2>ECS1>ECS4>ECS3, with consistency ratio 0.0140. Investing in renewable energy (ECS2) holds the first position within the Energy Consumption and Saving category with the highest score (0.5354). Moreover, initiatives to reduce energy consumption (ECS1) is located at the second position with a score of 0.4646. The third and fourth sub-criteria within the energy consumption and saving category are energy use efficiency (ECS4) and energy saving policies (ECS3), which received weights of 0.4520 and 0.3752, respectively.

Investments in renewable energy projects lead to greater engagement by the local community related to renewable energy development. Thus, renewable energy projects can empower the community and enrich their social capital. In addition, an expected outcome is an increase in energy efficiency within a community and reducing energy costs. Organizations can improve sustainability by reducing material waste, energy consumption, and carbon emissions.

# 5. Conclusions

This study’s goal is to propose a corporate sustainability framework that is more resilient than prior models and, to rank relevant criteria to the degree that could help develop a corporate sustainability model. This study is grounded in previous studies and showed the interconnected relations of sustainability and the relevance of considering stakeholders [107]. In meeting the objectives of this study we have multiple contributions to the field of sustainable business practices; (1) to help researchers and practitioners identify essential corporate sustainability criteria as part of a new integrated framework; (2) provide a methodology to help organize and understand a dynamic context for sustainable business practices; (3) extend our understanding of social sustainability by also exploring and finding new insights regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

We were able to identify several sustainability attributes from literature, which allowed for an analysis of prior studies and the identification of sustainability attributes, which is also supported by experts’ assessments. As a result, 45 sustainability sub-criteria were developed and ranked according to the main nine categories of Corporate Governance, Transparency and Communication, Product Responsibility, Environment, Social, Economics, Natural Environment and Climate Change, Energy Consumption and Saving and, for the very first time, we have included Pandemic as an important criterion in the development of corporate sustainability model. These criteria help to develop a new integrative framework of social sustainability. Additional contributions of this study include the application of a Fuzzy Delphi and FAHP methodology, and the computation of nine main criteria and 45 sub-criteria. These criteria provide a more dynamic assessment of the interrelated social dimensions that have in the past been looked at individually and as environmental impacts of firms. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new insights include the Pandemic, along with Economic and Corporate Governance are top-ranked criteria to focus on improving corporate sustainability practices. Whereas, emergency response plan, social distance and modification in the number of working hours, commitment to climate changes, and JIT and lean delivery emerged in the top-ranked sub-criteria.

The outcomes of our work lead us to call for more action from decision-makers and policymakers as sustainability provides an integration opportunity with dynamic social benefits. Moreover, scholars also can consider relevant criteria from literature, and building on this research when combining insights from experts and develop a new, more integrated, corporate sustainability model. The research in this study also contributes to developing theory with contemporary approaches for decision-making analysis to show corporate sustainability theory can and should include more social sustainability practices. When doing so, we hope the efforts of both researchers and practitioners will be able to find more dynamic relationships between practices, firm performance, and resiliency to overcome future pandemics. Our results also provide insights to scholars wanting to further develop theories considering Multiple Management Standards (MMSs), the Stakeholder Theory [108], Integrated Management [109], Integrated Management Systems (IMS), and possibilities for a new theory such as a social sustainability-based view (SBV) of the firm.

The methods used in this study support decision-making in a powerful and relatively simple way. This useful perspective addresses decision-makers and researchers dealing with resource allocation or project prioritization. These methods may be applied toward further replications by future studies. The methods described in this study help in measuring strategic goals as a set of scored criteria for determining project selection. Multi-criterion decision-making methodologies have proven to be useful in the application for manufacturing sectors. We can foresee the need for more work with these types of firms using the application of MCDA in complex interdisciplinary and social sustainability problems. We recommend future studies include developing FAHP techniques in combination with other analysis opportunities in an integrated system, supply chains, cities, and even entire countries aiming to tackle grand challenges, for example, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

# Sustainability 2020, 12, 8747

Finally, this research is the first of its kind considering the development of an integrated social sustainability model with social sustainability criteria that include the pandemic and COVID-19. Outcomes of this study can help organizations to consider the most suitable programs and systems for advancing corporate sustainability while also considering stakeholders and social sustainability. As managerial implications, we see sustainable development enabling companies to integrate audits, engage personnel, and optimizing companies’ processes and resource allocation. Social sustainability is dynamic, not easily understood, and can be disruptive if not taken into account as part of corporate social sustainability at every level of the firm.

This study presents some limitations. We address the limitation related to the developed models based on experts’ assessments. By choosing this approach, it is assumed that bias will always occur in the process. Future applications of this approach may include a diversified set of experts and managers from companies that may be more impacted by systems implementations. Another limitation is concerning data availability. Managers involved in an MCDA process may have limited access to data concerning all criteria or even the entire multinational company as a consequence of a lack of integrated information. Moreover, these issues can be solved by careful consideration of practitioners involved in the decision-making process when realizing that inputs are qualitative, in nature, and the time needed for options assessments. Then, the criteria and outcomes should be revisited when assessing corporate sustainability performance over time.
