# Introduction

In summer 2020, we introduced our strategy to turn SAP into a genuine cloud company. Since then, we have seen great progress in its evolution and further confirmation that this strategy is more relevant than ever. Businesses of all sizes continue to look to us as their trusted partner in helping them, industries, and entire nations become agile, achieve more across their value chains, and reach sustainability at their core.

## Strategic Context 2024
We are being challenged by the biggest transformation in our industry for decades which is driven by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), competitive pressure, and a changing macroeconomic environment with parts of the world in turmoil:

- **AI:** AI transforms our industry at unparalleled speed and represents a leapfrog moment. Competitors and customers are quickly shifting investments to AI, sorting industry players into leaders and laggards, while increasing scrutiny of their own spending.
- **Competitive pressure:** Our industry is hypercompetitive. Key players are outpacing us in both absolute and relative revenue as well as profit growth, showing more scale benefits, while aggressively shifting investments to AI. At current pace and speed, we will not be best in class in our industry.
- **Macroeconomic condition:** The macroeconomic landscape continues to be one of uncertainty with global events ranging from inflation, military conflicts, and the aftermath of the pandemic. They highlight the fragility of our interconnected global supply chains and put business processes under pressure. At the same time, they have brought efficiency into the center of it all.

As an industry, we are benefiting from a secular trend for digitalization, cloud, and AI. So now is the time to rise to these challenges and turn them into opportunities to ensure that we are best in the industry today and in the future. As SAP, we have many strengths to build on:

- **Exceptional product portfolio:** We have an unrivaled portfolio of solutions, and customer satisfaction is improving. Cloud ERP and SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) are the foundation of SAP’s best-of-suite product portfolio, the foundation for our company’s success. When a customer uses our Cloud ERP solutions, they are 2x more likely to use another SAP line-of-business (LoB) solution rather than a competitive solution. With that in mind, we strive to make it easier for customers to consume our entire portfolio through cross-portfolio solution bundles.

## Strategy Updates 2024
As we are entering the next phase of our transformation to respond to these challenges and opportunities, we are also evolving our strategy to provide even more clarity about our vision and goal.

Our purpose of helping the world run better and improving people’s lives remains our reason for being.

Our vision is all about the role we want to play in this world and what our customers can expect from us. Now we make it even clearer: We bring out the best in every business.

As AI is the defining technology of our generation, we must ensure that it is at the core of every solution we develop. If we are not leading in Business AI, we will also not be the leading enterprise application provider. That is why we evolve our goal to being the #1 Enterprise Application and Business AI company, powered by our leading platform.

To steer SAP through this next phase of our transformation and ensure we stay on track, the Executive Board defined five cross-Board area Focus Programs:

- **Next-Gen Innovation:** Innovate to solve our customers’ biggest challenges
- **Next-Level Adoption and Consumption:** Increase the speed by which customers adopt our solution portfolio
- **End-to-End (E2E) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Growth:** Deliver growth in the cloud, particularly in public cloud
- **E2E Process Excellence:** Drive process excellence to achieve higher operational efficiency across all areas
- **Winning Culture:** Embrace a winning culture that values accountability, performance, subject-matter expertise, and continuous learning

Providing clear direction is upon the SAP Executive Board. Bringing our evolved strategy to life at unparalleled speed and ensuring a successful transformation requires all of us. That is why this white paper provides further details about our product portfolio, operating model, culture, as well as updated direction on our strategic priorities and how they are relevant for each of us across product, go-to-market, and corporate functions.

# The Why
## Our Purpose
To help the world run better and improve people’s lives.

SAP's purpose remains steadfast: to help the world run better and improve people’s lives. As we embrace the challenges of the current environment, our focus sharpens on the transformative power of AI in business. Technology, especially “Business AI,” is essential in addressing the most profound environmental, economic, and social challenges of our era. Software and analytics have the power to help predict and prevent disasters, make cities smarter, and foster equity in workplaces. In this era of rapid technological evolution, we recognize our role in minimizing carbon footprints and promoting human rights through reliable AI and data-driven insights.

SAP is at the forefront of this technological wave, uniquely combining generative AI with business data. We are committed to providing AI solutions that are integral to our customers' most critical business processes, ensuring they are built-in, relevant, and responsible.

When our customers aspire to clean the ocean, transform industries, or redefine the future of work, SAP stands alongside with technology and applications that are not just innovative, but also deeply integrated with AI, to turn these visions into reality.

# The What
## Our Vision
To bring out the best in every business.

Our vision reflects our commitment to transform organizations globally. We are building a future where businesses not only adapt rapidly to changes but also embed sustainability in their operations and drive greater productivity. Our three pillars of commitment underline this vision:

1. **Agility at Scale:** In a rapidly changing landscape, the need for business agility is paramount to maintain competitiveness. We facilitate this through purpose-built innovations and real-time data insights, enabling organizations to scale swiftly and respond promptly to market conditions. Our cloud ERP solutions and SAP Business AI are seamlessly integrated, providing unprecedented agility and empowering organizations to pivot effortlessly, whether to strategic shifts or unexpected market scenarios.

2. **Achieve More Across the Value Chain:** We assist organizations in harnessing collective intelligence, thereby optimizing performance across the value chain. By connecting core processes—from finance to supply chains, and human resources to customer relations—we fuel efficient growth throughout businesses. Our solutions go beyond internal systems, linking businesses across enterprises and digitalizing transactions to foster transparent, resilient, and sustainable value chains.

3. **Sustainability at Your Core:** We have evolved beyond mere sustainability aspirations to actionable, sustainable outcomes. Our green ledger initiative ensures robust, auditable sustainability practices are a natural extension of business operations. This innovative approach enables organizations to record real impacts, report audit-ready ESG metrics, and act with ESG principles integrated into business processes—fostering genuine, data-driven sustainability management.

At SAP, we are more than just a technology provider; we are engineers of progress. Our journey is one of continuous innovation and transformation, committed to delivering solutions that are not only relevant and reliable but also responsible. In a world where technology and business are increasingly intertwined, we have the unique ability and position to help companies maximize performance and positive impact on the world.

Every day we help companies bring out their very best.

# Our Goal
## #1 Enterprise Application and Business AI company, powered by our leading platform.
Backed with a clear purpose and vision, we are committed to making SAP the #1 Enterprise Application and Business AI company, powered by our leading platform. These goals go hand in hand given that, if we are not leading in Business AI, we will also not be the leading enterprise application provider.

#1 Enterprise Application and Business AI company means being #1 in market share, #1 in customer satisfaction, #1 in customer lifetime value, and #1 in portfolio adoption. We are not leading in all of these today, so we must increase our focus to get there. We must make fewer, bigger bets to lead in everything we do, so we can continue profitable growth. This means investing to win and not being spread too thin. Focus requires commitment and trade-offs. Placing bets and making trade-offs is hard, but this is the only way we can be #1.

# Our Strategic Priorities
## Our strategic priorities guide our actions to achieve our company goal.

# Our Product Strategy
## Innovate and focus our portfolio
SAP has many strengths to build on: We offer the world's leading ERP solutions, representing a center of gravity for critical enterprise data and the key ingredient for relevant Business AI. We have an unmatched portfolio of business applications that define how business processes run. We can provide unprecedented value for customers when these business processes are running smoothly in an integrated intelligent suite that is powered by SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). With more than 400,000 customers globally, we – together with our partners – can scale the impact of our solutions beyond a single enterprise and elevate our New Growth Areas – SAP Signavio, SAP Business Network, Taulia, Sustainability and Business AI – into new heights.

## portfolio along three priorities to fulfil our vision to bring out the best in every business:
### Infuse Business AI across the SAP product portfolio
We leverage our data treasure to deeply embed relevant, reliable, and responsible Business AI across our portfolio, becoming the market leader and thereby defining the standards for trustworthy Business AI. Business AI revolutionizes how our customers work and interact with SAP solutions – that is, by automating business processes or our AI assistant Joule. With an open AI foundation on SAP BTP, we empower customers and partners to consume and build context-aware, intelligent applications. AI is already a central, integrated capability of our enterprise applications and business technology and used by tens of thousands of our cloud customers.

### Build and run the leading suite for every business with Cloud ERP and BTP at the core complemented by HXM, ISBN, and CX
We differentiate in the market by enabling consistent, end-to-end processes through an integrated, intelligent suite of business applications. SAP has the technologies, products, footprint, and vision to weave together four essential business processes: recruit to retire, source to pay, design to operate, and lead to cash. This type of holistic integration is unique – the deep intelligence it enables has never been possible before.

## Figure 2 | Our Product Portfolio
### Market View
Building on these strengths, we innovate and focus our portfolio.

# Cloud ERP and SAP BTP

Cloud ERP and SAP BTP form the sockets of our leading suite. Why? Our numbers show that win-rates for our LoB solutions increase significantly when our customers are already using our Cloud ERP solutions. In this sense, addressing new customers with our world-class Cloud ERP opens the door for cross- and upselling opportunities. All of this is powered by SAP BTP as the business-centric extension, integration, data, and AI platform for our entire ecosystem, allowing SAP teams, partners, and customers to build new cloud applications, unify, enhance, and augment the SAP product portfolio and drive innovation.

To build and run the leading suite, we must harmonize the experience across our Solution Areas. Our Cross-Priorities help us to deliver an exceptional user experience, more innovation, better integration, localization, and cloud operational excellence. We underpin this through a seamless end-to-end, proactive customer support powered by AI.

In combination, our five Solution Areas combine to make up our leading suite:

## Our Cloud ERP Solutions
- Not only provide robust capabilities in finance, subscription billing, and sustainability, but – thanks to the tight integration of our Cloud ERP and Digital Supply Chain (DSC) solutions – enables our customers to digitalize their supply chain and operations processes from end to end. This allows our customers to grow and optimize their business on their terms, while handling disruptions better, faster and at lower cost.

## Business Technology Platform (BTP)
- Comprises the cloud-native technology services that power our enterprise application portfolio. With capabilities for application development, automation, integration, data and analytics, as well as AI, it provides internal SAP teams, customers and partners business-centric tools to enhance business processes in and beyond SAP-centric enterprise landscapes.

## SuccessFactors (HXM)
- As the most comprehensive and global HR cloud software, our SuccessFactors (HXM) suite unlocks the full potential of every employee and the entire organization by harnessing the power of AI to elevate every experience, guide every people decision, and connect HR across every aspect of the business.

## Intelligent Spend & Business Network (ISBN)
- Applications power the future of procurement – a function that has become mission critical in a world of increasing supply chain disruptions. Next-gen procurement, travel and expenses, contingent workforce planning, and business network each represent significant growth opportunities for SAP.

## Customer Experience (CX)
- Solutions equip companies to capture their customers' behaviors and preferences, paving the way for hyperpersonalized engagement. By integrating seamlessly with ERP systems, these applications create a powerful bridge between operational data and customer experiences, reaching customers regardless of their location. AI-powered and machine learning supported analytics incorporated into these applications provide a deep understanding of customers, aiding optimum business decisions.

In addition to our Solution Areas, we provide industry-specific innovations. For the majority, those industry capabilities are delivered in our SAP S/4HANA Cloud core, our LoB solutions, or industry cloud solutions. The latter is our new, open innovation space for SAP and our partners to modularly extend our core and LoB solutions. This empowers every vertical industry to deliver differentiated and innovative capabilities building on SAP technologies.

It is essential that – across all SAP solutions – we are guiding our customers' transformation journey across their overall lifecycle, from initial co-innovation, implementation, and migration to operations and customer support – always guarding business value creation. In a similar vein, we guide our substantial ERP installed base on their journey to a modular cloud ERP. This includes educating them on standardizing their core SAP S/4HANA Cloud processes, building extensions and innovating on SAP BTP, and using cloud-native industry solutions.

## Accelerate Business-Driven Innovation and Scale Our New Growth Areas
Innovation has always been at the heart of what we do. We have over 50 years of experience of putting technology in the context of business by creating solutions for our customers. Innovation is what we look back at and likewise remains an integral part of our future. It is our ambition to accelerate business-driven innovation that creates tangible, real-life customer value. We focus our innovation across three key innovation fields:
1. The future of business processes
2. The future of business collaboration
3. The future of data-driven decision-making

Our New Growth Areas represent key opportunities and accelerators in these fields. They are adjacent areas to our existing businesses and will help us future-proof SAP, by entering new market categories that expand our total addressable market.

# The What

Our strategic focus is on scaling these growth areas. To seize these areas they are operating in a tailored setup that suits their maturity level and helps them to accelerate scaling within the SAP ecosystem.

- **SAP Signavio solutions** put us front and center in the transformations our customers are going through. On top of running the broadest portfolio of business applications, SAP Signavio solutions can help our customers understand, improve, and transform all their business processes. Hence, accelerating speed of transformation by improving agility, measured through time-to-insights and time-to-adapt.

- **SAP Business Network** is the largest and most comprehensive B2B collaboration platform, trusted by millions of companies around the world and powering more than 700M transactions. It connects people, processes, and systems across multiple enterprises – digitalizing transactions and creating transparent, resilient, and sustainable supply chains.

- **Taulia Working Capital Management** further expands the value offered to the CFO. To combat the effects of rising interest rates, visibility into working capital and access to liquidity when needed is of companies’ highest priority. Specifically, the Taulia Cash Flow Acceleration solution is not only designed to accelerate cashflow, but also allows sustainability to be embedded into core processes by offering financing to stimulate the supply base to improve their ESG credentials.

- **Sustainability** is at the core of SAP's vision and presents a unique opportunity for us to help customers in pursuing sustainability-focused opportunities and innovation, preparing to mitigate climate, resource and social-related risks, and driving long-term business value. We have a comprehensive portfolio of sustainability solutions and services to help our customers drive sustainable practices not only inside their organization, but across their value chains. With our cloud-driven innovations – and evolving AI-powered sustainability use cases – we support customers in building the foundation for their long-term sustainability strategies. We do so by giving them the tools to be agile and responsive, maintain control of integration and data flows, and master the complexity of sustainability challenges. With SAP customers generating *87% of total global commerce, we have a unique opportunity together with our customers across more than 26 industries to create a more sustainable world.

- **Business AI** is the defining technology of our time. As outlined in the dedicated Strategic Priority “Infuse Business AI across the SAP Product Portfolio”, it is our ambition to become the market leader in Business AI by scaling AI across our entire product portfolio. Therefore, we establish Business AI as a dedicated New Growth Area in the Office of the CEO.

# Our Go-to-Market Strategy
## Grow jointly with our customers and partners

The opportunity in the cloud is massive, but the competition is fierce. Any cloud transition creates a new customer decision point with the chance for us to win or lose. When we execute with conviction and as a team, this environment will be an advantage for SAP.

By 2025, we want SAP to be the industry standard for maximizing customer lifetime value by delivering exceptional experiences, tangible business outcomes, differentiated value propositions, and a vibrant ecosystem. We deliver on our go-to-market (GTM) strategy through three strategic pillars.

### Scale through a digital-first connected customer value journey

We must accelerate our sales efforts and build momentum for our sellers, at scale, so that they can focus on solutioning with our customers. Our objective is to deliver self-service, digital-first connected customer journeys with aligned content and activities spanning each phase of our Customer Value Journey that effectively builds and converts pipeline for SAP solutions. We holistically plan and execute digital and event demand generation activities across our Marketing & Solutions and Customer Success Board areas. In addition, we expand virtualization and digitization across go-to-market functions to build an efficient GTM engine across all customer archetypes.

### Differentiate the customer experience through targeted engagement

A differentiated customer experience is critical for our ability to successfully go to market given the intensity of competition in our industry grows every year. We aim to deliver on this strategic priority by transforming our GTM model to reflect our customers' business needs and meet our ambitious revenue goals. We are shifting away from our legacy customer segments and transitioning into new customer archetypes with more empowered GTM roles and the strength of our exceptional partner ecosystem. Engaging with customers, partners, and other external stakeholders in such a targeted and integrated manner allows us to go to market as strongly as possible.

### Grow customer lifetime value by driving adoption and consumption across the portfolio

We set the standard for success as maximizing customer lifetime value, representing the cumulative value delivered to our customer throughout their lasting relationship with SAP. This remains our unwavering metric, steering our priorities, investments, and strategic business decisions. Acknowledging the link between strong adoption and consumption, customer lifetime value and topline growth, we continue to adapt our go-to-market strategy and optimize across our winning portfolio. This ensures our relevance across the entire Customer Value Journey, from the discovery of our new customer-centric, cross-portfolio commercial offerings to the point where customers derive value in a new business vertical with our cloud solutions.

# Our Corporate Functions Strategy
Transform SAP with our people at the center

Together we will shape our future and set new benchmarks of excellence by unleashing the combined power of our people, operations, and finance.

## Drive a winning culture by empowering our people to thrive in the Future of Work
Just as we help our customers digitalize, simplify processes, and create amazing experiences, we do the same for our employees. We foster a healthy, inclusive, and diverse environment at SAP. We will continue to deliver our leading HR consumer experiences at scale, while building SAP’s skills for the future, rewarding performance, and role modelling accountability, inspiring leadership.

We focus on four priorities:
- Build SAP’s skills for the future
- Drive SAP’s winning and inclusive culture
- Change the way we lead – do what’s right
- Deliver HR operational excellence

## Shape SAP’s transformation and drive end-to-end operational excellence
Being a successful cloud business requires constant transformation. We shape the next phase of our transformation by developing a highly efficient and customer-centric cloud operating model. We do so by focusing on best-in-class process excellence and automation powered by leading technologies like AI, creating a harmonized operating system for strategy and operations teams with clear roles and responsibilities, and by accelerating strategy-to-execution.

## Foster long-term cash flow growth and create sustainable shareholder value
With our customer-centric mindset we develop and improve finance processes for a smooth end-to-end experience, creating business impact and value for our internal and external customers. We use our own products and technologies in the spirit of “SAP Runs SAP” to unveil improvement and automation potential as well as uncover opportunities for the use of AI and latest innovations. By bringing transparency to ESG-related data and incorporating financial and non-financial value into decision-making, we actively challenge the status quo and lead sustainability transformation in our finance. Our diverse and passionate team is supported by upskilling and exchange opportunities, and equipped with a future-ready skillset to perform in a state-of-the-art service delivery model. We foster predictable cash flow growth and intelligent steering to enable ambitious business decisions across SAP. Thus, creating sustainable shareholder value by serving our stakeholders in a transparent manner and making no compromise on compliance.

With this in mind, we introduced an operating model in July 2021 that enables us to act as One SAP. To lead each of our Solution Areas, three roles jointly determine target markets and market requirements, define growth plans, and deliver on one plan with shared goals and incentives:

### The chief product officer (CPO)
drives innovation across the product road map. This role has been established within the SAP Product Engineering or Technology & Innovation Board areas, reporting to either Thomas Saueressig or Juergen Mueller, respectively.

### The chief marketing and solution officer (CMSO)
drives product marketing ensuring an outside-in, growth-oriented perspective, and reports to Julia White leading the Marketing & Solutions Board area.

### The chief revenue officer (CRO)
focuses on customer success and revenue generation as well as leveraging our partner ecosystem. This role sits within the Customer Success Board area, reporting to Scott Russell.

For each Solution Area, these three leaders are responsible

| **Solution Area**                     | **Chief Product Officer** | **Chief Marketing & Solution Officer** | **Chief Revenue Officer** |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Cloud ERP                             |                           |                                        |                           |
| SuccessFactors (HXM)                 |                           |                                        |                           |
| Customer Experience (CX)              |                           |                                        |                           |
| Intelligent Spend & Business Network (ISBN) |                     |                                        |                           |
| Business Technology Platform (BTP)    |                           |                                        |                           |
| Business Transformation                |                           |                                        |                           |
| Supporting Solution Areas             |                           |                                        |                           |

### Figure 3 | Our Operating Model

To ensure we deliver the greatest market growth from our product investments, we are shifting to cloud-oriented Product Management and Product Marketing functions with clear roles and responsibilities and moving away from Solution Management roles. We are also further evolving our 3-in-a-box operating model to establish the Chief Product Officer as the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) accountable to defining a cohesive Solution Area strategy, and empowered to make decisions as well as to resolve issues as needed for speed and agility of execution.

With our operating model, we truly come together as One SAP.

# Focus Programs

The next phase of our transformation – five Focus Programs to double down on our strategic priorities.

We launched our Focus Programs in the key areas of product innovation, adoption and consumption, our SaaS growth, operational excellence, and winning culture. These programs represent our key vehicle to execute on our strategy. Each of them is led by a Board member, with work streams driven by directly responsible L1 leaders, and involving employees from across all of SAP.

## Next-Gen Innovation
The Focus Program aims to fundamentally transform our business applications and platform through artificial intelligence, UX design, and seamlessly integrated end-to-end business processes. We will make SAP the leader in Business AI with base and premium AI capabilities that are relevant, reliable, and responsive, leveraging our deep business process knowledge and mission-critical business data. We will improve product user experience and usability across all SAP products and connected scenarios and deliver seamless end-to-end business processes with a consistent experience for our customers.

## Next-Level Adoption and Consumption
Our goal in this Focus Program is to increase customer lifetime value, reduce customer churn, and increase revenue retention by implementing a Customer Success (CS) End-to-End Customer Engagement Model that seamlessly drives our customers’ adoption and consumption in a cloud world. Adoption, innovation, and a change of mindset are the key elements to the future success of our customers, partners, and SAP.

# Our Culture

To win in any market, the way we work together is as important as what we set out to do.

We foster a culture that enables and rewards impact and business outcomes. We drive for accountability and empowerment in a healthy, inclusive, and diverse environment. And we are building a consistent understanding of SAP culture and leadership, co-created by employees across the company.

In 2021 we introduced our new leadership credo:  
**Do what’s right. Make SAP better for generations to come.**

Every day, leaders at SAP use this credo to drive their actions. It sustains our now and sustains our future.

As leaders, we hold ourselves to a high standard, we challenge ourselves every day to build a better SAP for the future. We are not comfortable with good enough. Our leadership credo and expectations encourage us, leaders, to be agile, to be ethical, to be inclusive, and to be accountable and to bring our strategy to life.

Here are our core behaviors for **How We Run** that will fuel our culture into the future:

| Behavior                          | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

# Our Strategic Priorities
## Product Strategy Deep Dive
### Innovate and focus the portfolio

We have many strengths to build on.

A diverse and robust portfolio of business applications is certainly one of these. We believe in the value our solutions can offer when they run smoothly integrated in an intelligent suite. With SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) and our suite qualities as the foundation and fabric across applications, we go beyond the technical integrations into SAP systems that our competitors provide today.

We offer four essential business processes that are foundational to modular ERP: lead to cash, source to pay, recruit to retire, and design to operate. These scenarios become even more valuable when they are connected across company borders. Through each business, the supply chain overall thrives. Live and interconnected data flows enable cross-analytics, cross-planning, embedded AI, and recommendations for business decisions. This will redefine how processes will run in the future.

Our customer base plays a big role in defining our product strategy. With hundreds of thousands of companies as our installed base, we—together with our partners—can scale the impact of our powerful solutions beyond a single enterprise.

The “data treasure” resulting from the huge amount of data that runs through SAP systems around the world every day is one of our greatest assets. Unlocked, it has the potential to deliver unique insights into value chains. This data is the key ingredient for relevant Business AI that SAP provides, always adhering to the highest data confidentiality standards.

Our diverse partner ecosystem offers innovations that complement SAP applications—with innovative applications or cloud extensions built on SAP BTP. They influence the adoption of SAP technologies that support customers’ unique needs, contributing to SAP’s growth by expanding our market reach in sales and services. With its deep industry and domain knowledge, the partner ecosystem enables SAP to build, sell, and deliver customer success at scale as we reach new markets and growth areas.

We use these strengths to our advantage, focusing on three strategic priorities that guide our product strategy:

- Infuse Business AI across the SAP product portfolio
- Build and run the leading suite for every business with Cloud ERP and BTP, complemented by HXM, ISBN, and CX
- Accelerate business-driven innovation and scale our New Growth Areas

## Infuse Business AI across the SAP product portfolio

The world is sitting on the cusp of the next great technological revolution, driven by fast-moving advances in artificial intelligence (AI). AI extends the reach of computers by understanding unstructured data and addressing problems too complex for deterministic programming and rules. Now, generative AI is rapidly unlocking previously unimaginable capabilities, such as generating code based on natural language input and answering questions from the context that is flowing through business systems. This creates an imperative for SAP to deliver more value to our customers and transform SAP’s products into an AI-powered portfolio.

SAP is uniquely positioned to help our customers benefit from artificial intelligence by delivering Business AI, which we define as:
- **Relevant:** AI delivered, from day one, across all SAP applications that customers use to run their businesses.
- **Reliable:** AI based on unique business data and business process context to ensure truthful, real-time results, all following the same enterprise standards that customers expect from SAP.
- **Responsible:** AI built on leading ethics and data privacy standards.

SAP will be the market leader for Business AI by 2025. To get there we must:
- **Leverage our unique data assets:** SAP cloud customers have entrusted us with access to data from over 25,000 customer tenants to build new products, including training AI models. SAP also uniquely understands the complex business processes and semantic relationships underpinning our customer data.

# Enrich and Transform All SAP Cloud Products
- **Enrich and transform all SAP cloud products by infusing AI features that add business value.** Every SAP cloud solution and SAP BTP service must have a rich pipeline of AI-powered innovations that automate repetitive tasks, improve user experience by allowing natural interaction with our systems, and extend human decisions and cognitions through insights, optimizations, and recommendations.

- **Create a strong AI foundation on SAP BTP.** We will evolve existing and develop new foundational components so that SAP BTP becomes the trusted orchestration layer for all assets and the go-to platform to build intelligent business applications. This includes access to leading Large Language Models (LLMs) that SAP adapts to business context. In addition to adapting existing models, SAP BTP will also provide an own foundation model trained on tabular SAP data, enabling unprecedented performance for low-data settings in customer environments and capabilities such as forecasting that LLMs lack.

- **Unleash SAP’s ecosystem.** SAP’s more than 25,500 strong partners play a critical role in helping our customers adopt available AI features. Besides teaming up with general-purpose AI platforms (such as Databricks and AWS SageMaker) and LLM providers (such as Microsoft Azure Open AI service), we also empower partners to build AI-powered extensions, add-ons, and applications on SAP BTP to fulfill specific customer needs. We must help systems integrators apply generative AI to condense cloud transformation projects.

- **Make AI simple for customers to consume and for SAP to position.** Customers care about business value, not technology, while at the same time harboring fears and misunderstandings about AI. We must clearly communicate the business value of AI features and make it simple – commercially and technically – for customers to activate. Customers will either get basic AI as part of their existing SAP cloud subscriptions or with a premium add-on.

- **Focus on the cloud.** Modern AI happens in the cloud and creates incentives for customers to move to the cloud. On-premise customers can still create custom AI features by using SAP BTP services like SAP AI Core. But we will not deliver AI features in SAP standard on-premise software since it is not scalable.

- **Always ensure we release only responsible AI.** Customer trust is one of SAP’s core assets, but trust built up over decades can be easily broken. We make no compromises when it comes to applying responsible AI practices.

# Build and Run the Leading Suite for Every Business with Cloud ERP and BTP
- **Using the AI foundation on SAP BTP and AI Services will support SAP teams in adhering to ethical and product standards.**

- **With the unmatched breadth of its portfolio, SAP is in the unique position to holistically cover the most mission-critical processes of any business.** To build on this strength and accelerate our vision, we must focus more. This requires commitment and trade-offs.

- **We strongly align our portfolio investments to build and run the leading suite and accelerate growth:**
  - We can see that win rates for our LoB solutions increase when a customer is already using our Cloud ERP solution. By establishing Cloud ERP products and SAP BTP as the core of our portfolio, we can tap into this cross- and upselling potential. This requires a strong product integration between the respective Solution Areas. We achieve this by building carve-outs and new cloud modules for Cloud ERP solutions fully on SAP BTP, by embedding SAP BTP capabilities such as analytics or automation directly into Cloud ERP products, or by providing business accelerators specific to Cloud ERP through SAP BTP, that is, prebuilt integration packs, process templates, or analytics scenarios.

  - With our SAP BTP Customer Evolution Program, we continue to accelerate our existing customers’ journey towards becoming more intelligent and sustainable and supporting their move from on-premise solutions to the cloud. It is true that many enterprises continue to have on-premise operations. At the same time, most of them run hybrid operations, with innovation happening in the cloud. Bringing together our best practices, latest innovations, services, and powerful ecosystem, we guide them towards a holistic landscape and business process transformation that is tailored to their unique business needs.

- **We unify the experience of SAP applications by enabling Suite Qualities** – that is, one workflow inbox or consistent single sign-on – and driving Cross-Priorities such as localization, next-gen user experience, cloud operational excellence, innovation, and integration. Our efforts have already paid off: Those areas in our portfolio with strong integration to Cloud ERP have accelerated growth across the portfolio. In this sense, we will continue enhancing the value customers get from adopting multiple SAP solutions.

# Introduction
## The Why
## The What
## The How
## Ambition
## Conclusion
## Deep Dives

- **Collaborative:** Collaboration is the very essence of Cloud ERP which binds the people and processes across the organization bringing the power of structured and unstructured data together at the right time, right place, and right context. Collaboration boosts individual and team productivity, enhances the experience, and brings valuable business outcomes for our customers.
- **Networked:** The entire end-to-end supply chain is involved in delivering a product or service and spans beyond company borders. Visibility and transparency into this network provide the collective resilience and agility to absorb shocks and bounce back.
- **Sustainable:** Sustainability is a must-have for businesses today: Customers are conscious about the product’s journey and governments are introducing regulations and mandates. Cloud ERP offers the digital backbone that provides the required transparency and insights on environmental and societal impacts.

With Cloud ERP solutions, our customers leverage standard industry best practices to run efficiently across the globe, stay competitive and constantly adopt innovations. On top of standard requirements, they innovate, differentiate and extend further to address unique business needs with SAP BTP. As every supply chain process ultimately starts, goes through, or ends in a company’s ERP layer, our Digital Supply Chain (DSC) solutions are an integral part of Cloud ERP. With DSC solutions, SAP helps customers to rethink and reimagine how supply chains work.

# Business Technology Platform (BTP)
To meet enterprise-grade requirements, SAP BTP – across its capabilities for application development, automation, integration, data and analytics, and AI – continues to strengthen foundational qualities such as security, availability, and scalability while providing openness to third-party technology.

However, the single source of differentiation lies in the “B” in SAP BTP – business-centricity. SAP’s vast understanding of business processes and business users is reflected for SAP BTP in a business-on-business context (for example, with the ability to orchestrate all business data in SAP Datasphere), accelerated business outcomes (for example, with generative AI-powered code generation) and an integrated business-friendly experience (for example, with no-code tools for business users).

To amplify our strategic differentiation, we have set clear priorities for 2024 in the context of **Five Strategic Moves for BTP:**
- **Future-proof the foundation:** Reinforce the focus on platform security, availability, and scalability.
- **Differentiate through business-centricity:** Make SAP BTP the foundation for Cloud ERP development, accelerate business content lifecycle management and amplify business outcomes with generative AI.
- **Accelerate customer adoption:** Further unify the SAP BTP customer experience, onboarding, and support as well as provide technical and commercial migration paths from SAP legacy technology to SAP BTP.
- **Boost the ecosystem:** Improve the end-to-end partner experience and empower partners to extend SAP processes along our clean core strategy and build intelligent applications with SAP BTP.
- **Drive the internal transformation:** Improve internal processes, governance, and collaboration models to accelerate the joint success of SAP applications and SAP BTP.

HXM, ISBN, and CX complement Cloud ERP and BTP and complete our best-of-suite offering:

# SuccessFactors (HXM)
HXM unleashes the power of human potential at work. SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite goes beyond traditional human capital management (HCM) delivering experiences that keep people engaged and productive while seamlessly connecting HR across the business to ensure both profitability and sustainability.

# SAP Cloud Strategy

## Introduction
This enables enterprises to refine their processes and deliver products and services at new levels.

## The Why
SAP’s industry cloud extends our suite with modular industry cloud solutions that are built by SAP and partners on SAP BTP. While SAP S/4HANA Cloud provides a foundation with horizontal capabilities across industries and selected vertical capabilities for the core, industry cloud addresses the vertical specifics of industries.

## The What
Building the leading suite requires us to create a seamless, delightful experience for our customers that spans the entire portfolio, therefore we focus on our Cross-Priorities:

### Integration
We have a vibrant cross-product architecture working model that defines and enables execution of foundational and innovative integration and UX consistency. As reflected in the Suite Qualities, our main solutions will share one semantic data model, one analytics layer, one security concept, and the same application business services, such as SAP Task Center. This enables SAP to seamlessly implement the key end-to-end processes that are foundational to modular ERP: lead to cash, source to pay, recruit to retire, and design to operate.

### Embedded AI
As emphasized in our “Infuse Business AI across the SAP product portfolio” strategic priority, Business AI assumes a crucial role in our product strategy.

### Next-Gen UX
We drive UX excellence at scale by:
- a) Modernizing the design system and design language at SAP to be consumer grade and drive UX consistency and innovation velocity across portfolios
- b) Implementing telemetry into each product to measure the end-user experience
- c) Executing deep end-user usability studies to guide product development
- d) Meaningfully embed AI into our products with the definition and application
- e) All design patterns, guidelines, and standards
- f) Improving end-to-end experience quality through design excellence reviews of products and cross-product experiences
- g) Promoting inclusive experiences with a high degree of product accessibility compliance and adherence to industry standards

### Cloud Operational Excellence
We double down on cloud operational excellence to facilitate adoption of our public cloud solutions at scale. This includes improvements for our SaaS cloud architecture (harmonization), operational procedures and internal automation, our TCO, business continuity, as well as security. To operationalize this, we have defined Nine SAP Cloud Qualities that enable us to drive adoption and customer value of the most business-critical processes on SAP solutions.

### Localization
In today’s global economy, enterprises must rely on localized software solutions to enable compliance with legal regulations. SAP provides comprehensive localization across solutions, and evaluates and enables compliance with regulatory changes globally. This involves contextualizing these regulatory changes within the framework of a customer's business processes and SAP solutions, utilizing business infused AI. Localization helps customers comply with regulations across SAP solutions and hybrid deployments, supporting their transition to the cloud. This allows businesses to focus on sustainable business practices, market expansion, and growth.

## Ambition
Accelerate business-driven innovation and scale our New Growth Areas
Ninety-nine of the 100 largest customers in the world are SAP customers. Why? There is a simple explanation to that: our innovation emerged from a business challenge. That is what makes it relevant and likewise what makes us best in the field of business innovations for over 50 years. With that in mind, it remains our ambition to deliver business-driven innovation that creates tangible, real-life customer value. As an example, the best general purpose AI technology can only generate limited value without the proper enterprise data and business processes in which it is applied. This is where SAP is uniquely positioned by helping our customers in putting AI in the context of their business to generate maximum value and differentiation.

To explore innovations, it is important to know where to play and where we have a right to win. Therefore, we have defined three innovation fields, in which we see huge market opportunities that play to our strengths:

- **The future of business processes:** Business processes are our heritage and our future. We aim to enable the next generation of processes allowing for unprecedented business agility, such as continuously modularizing and composing processes.
  
- **The future of business collaboration:** It is our vision to enable companies to manage their business operations collaboratively and dynamically within and beyond their organizational boundaries, for example, through workflow automation across company borders.

# The future of data-driven business
- Intelligent technologies are on the rise and data is the currency of the future. SAP sits on a powerful data treasure that is awaiting to be unlocked to continuously infuse data and algorithms into businesses.

## Enablers for Innovation
To realize innovations in these fields, we believe in enablers for innovation that are:
- **Grounded in technology** – We leverage the transformative potential of emerging technologies by exploring and scaling them across the portfolio.
- **Powered by trusted application development** – We enable innovation through modern, cloud native, compliant and secure software development practices.
- **Delivered through human-centered experiences and design** – We provide innovation through human-centric user experience across all devices.

## Innovation Practices
In practice, we explore innovations across teams and along time horizons to ensure we are delivering innovation for our customers now, while continuously exploring future potential:
- We deliver continuous Solution Area innovation to differentiate our portfolio on a 1–2-year road map.
- We amplify the next level of growth through scaling our New Growth Areas as well as through catalyzing cross-portfolio innovations. We explore early trends and long-term opportunities that might translate into our portfolio over the course of 5+ years.

## SAP Signavio
Customers seek a technology partner that enables them to react quickly to change, capitalize on opportunities to innovate and remain competitive in their markets. SAP Signavio solutions have the ability to help customers understand, improve, and transform their business processes, accelerates their speed of transformation by improving their agility, measured through time-to-insights and time-to-adapt.

### SAP Signavio Business Process Management Suite
- Combines all capabilities customers need to deescalate risk, accelerate and spot potential business benefits in their cloud transformation: from process analysis to insights, process design and simulation, governance, enablement, and continuous monitoring.

### Plug and Gain Approach
- By combining out-of-the-box capabilities to identify relevant process insights and full process mining capabilities, customers benefit by gaining an understanding of process landscape, performance, standardization, and variances.

### Process Observability, Benchmarking, and Process AI
- By empowering our customers to identify process improvement areas based on automatically surfaced insight, the ability to compare to others with cross-company process performance benchmarks and having a value-based approach further accelerate the execution of process transformation.

### Value Accelerators
- We further decrease time-to-value for customers to analyze and understand processes in SAP enterprise applications. This is achieved through prebuilt connectors, analysis templates and SAP best practices processes.

All capabilities are further enhanced by SAP solutions in the areas of application lifecycle management, transformation tooling and solutions from SAP BTP.

## SAP Business Network
We live in an interconnected world where no business does business alone. This requires many enterprises to manage complex relationships of suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturers and others through static 1:1 connections, while using inefficient tools and processes, and a lack of real-time visibility across the supply chain.

## Figure 6
### Our Innovation Fields and Enablers Including New Growth Areas
Our New Growth Areas represent key opportunities and accelerators in our innovation fields. They are adjacent to our existing businesses and help us future-proof SAP, by entering new market categories that expand our total addressable market: SAP Signavio, SAP Business Network, Taulia, Sustainability and Business AI.

# Our Strategy
Our strategy is bringing together all stakeholders in ONE business network where they will be able to exchange business documents and key data in an orchestrated manner. New levels of visibility will enable businesses to respond quickly to any disruptions, minimizing business impact and ensuring continuity. From a sole trader to a multi-national enterprise, we will connect all trading partners.

We will merge our existing procurement, supply chain, logistics, asset, and industry-specific networks into a single integrated business network, creating the world's largest and most comprehensive business network and enabling a networked economy across every industry.

## SAP Business Network
SAP Business Network will serve as a business-to-business orchestration platform with open APIs to create a thriving network ecosystem comprised of other networks, partner solutions and value-added services. This will lead to enormous advantages in terms of speed, cost, supply chain optimization and assurance of supply.

## Taulia Working Capital Management
Challenging economic conditions and disruptions in supply chains have significantly increased demand for early payment. Taulia provides one of the broadest platform and solution portfolios across working capital management. Through a dozen financial institutions, Taulia has built a strong ecosystem of partners that provide the necessary funding. With market-leading working capital management and financing functionality such as supply chain finance, accounts receivables, and inventory finance as well as virtual cards, Taulia strengthens our portfolio with added value that is key to all customers: financial flexibility and stability. By combining Taulia’s deep working capital management capabilities with SAP’s broad CFO solution portfolio and the integration into our core business software and SAP Business Network solutions, we will lead the working capital management market and help businesses improve their financial position and seize growth opportunities.

## Sustainability
Our vision is to enable customers across all industries to transform into sustainable businesses. By helping build a connected foundation of sustainable business data from operations, partners, the supply chain, market makers, and standards bodies, we drive new and redefined business models and processes. We formed a new Sustainability business unit in 2022 focused on fueling new growth, combined with driving sustainability impact at SAP. Today, business leaders want to focus not only on their top and bottom lines, but also on measuring their environmental and social performance. SAP Sustainability solutions uniquely meet this need, enabling companies to record, report, and act on their sustainability goals.

## SAP Solutions
- SAP sustainability and ESG reporting solutions enable companies to connect their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and financial data to comply with evolving ESG regulations, while steering business toward sustainable decisions.
- SAP climate action solutions enable companies to reduce the carbon footprint of their value chain based on actual business transactions. They provide a path to a green ledger where companies can treat carbon like money, managing the carbon entering and leaving their systems and balancing their “carbon books” the same way as their financial books.
- SAP circular economy solutions enable businesses to incorporate circularity into their supply chain, providing the foundation to eliminate waste, optimize resource use, and innovate regenerative business models.
- SAP social responsibility solutions help companies understand the impact of their business on people and society and take action to manage the human impact of business across the value chain.

The speed of cloud delivery combined with the ability to integrate sustainability data into the core ERP system will optimize customers’ sustainability and financial performance and form the foundation for their future business success. Only SAP can provide enterprises with this holistic capability to make sustainability a driver for business transformation, with cloud the enabler of the agility needed to leverage continuous innovations – and evolving AI-powered sustainability use cases – delivered by SAP.

# Our Strategic Priorities

## Go-to-Market Strategy Deep Dive
### Grow jointly with customers and partners

### Scale through a digital-first connected customer value journey
Our objective is to deliver self-service, digital-first connected customer journeys with aligned content and activities spanning each phase of the Customer Value Journey that effectively builds and converts pipeline for SAP solutions. We focus on the following aspects:

- **Scale and synchronize digital and event demand generation across Marketing & Solutions and Customer Success Board areas**  
  We drive scaled digital and event demand generation. Getting to a digital-first approach is crucial to succeed as a cloud company. We must accelerate and synchronize our sales efforts, at scale, so that they can focus on solutioning with our customers. To increase efficiency and reduce customer acquisition cost, we manage a world-class marketing automation tech stack to support end-to-end, personalized customer journeys, while providing accurate reporting and analytics. This allows us to continually test, learn, and optimize the digital marketing tactics that perform best to increase the effectiveness of our investments across regions and audiences. Our event strategy complements the digital demand generation through a carefully curated set of high-impact, best-in-class, hybrid events that drive business outcomes, where every moment is valuable, every message is relevant, and everyone feels included.

- **Expand virtualization and digitalization across GTM functions**  
  To build an efficient GTM engine, we need to balance high-touch, low-touch, and digital/automated engagement across all customer archetypes. Our aim is to continue shifting a percentage of high-touch to low-touch engagement and low-touch to digital/automated engagement. These changes will be possible thanks to an increase in engagement performed out of our digital hubs (for example, virtualization) and through an improvement of digital tools utilization (for example, Sales Execution Platform and Live Sales Demo environment) and digital ways of working (for example, generative AI use cases) across all engagement types (that is, digitalization). These are improvements we have observed in the market by other competitors as they help to not only deliver a lower customer acquisition cost (CAC) but also lower cost to serve customers in the way most appropriate for them.

### Nurture multichannel customer journeys through integrated demand programs
We curate and nurture multichannel customer journeys. Our digital and event demand generation activities are holistically planned and executed through Integrated Demand Programs (IDPs). IDPs are digital customer journeys that we invest in to drive the growth priorities defined in the Winning Plans. These journeys are curated and optimized using digital signals across first and third-party engines (events, paid, media, web, and so on). The programs are geared to deliver demand by engaging and converting prospects and customers across the buyer’s journey.

### Differentiate the customer experience through targeted engagement
We differentiate our customer experience in three ways: firstly, through a new customer segmentation and internal role setup; secondly, by strengthening our industry depth that SAP has built up over decades together with our ecosystem; and thirdly, by enhancing the perception of SAP among customers and other external stakeholders across a wide spectrum.

### Establish new customer segmentation and roles to best meet customers’ needs
Our GTM evolution is focused on driving sales effectiveness through top-line acceleration, improving customer experience and driving engagement efficiencies end-to-end. As part of the Focus Program Next-Level Adoption and Consumption, we will clarify roles and responsibilities along the Customer Value Journey, reduce handover points, implement a new customer segmentation model, and integrate our partner ecosystem holistically. The objective is to ensure that clear business value is communicated to customers in every interaction with SAP. Complexity will be reduced by implementing clear end-to-end account relationships and adapting and streamlining customer-facing roles, and offering continuous value advisory support, even after deal closure. Additionally, by leveraging the strength of our partner ecosystem across all segments, we will scale SAP’s reach into existing and new markets and better serve the needs of our customers along the Customer Value Journey. For SAP, this means defining segments at lower cost of sales and higher customer satisfaction.

# Leverage industry-specific depth from SAP and our ecosystem

## Industry Focus
- ‘Industries’ has been at the core of SAP’s DNA since its foundation.
- Enables showcasing and delivering greater customer value.
- A key differentiator for SAP, understanding customer challenges and revenue generation.

## Strengthening Industry Expertise
- Continue to serve customers in all (26) industries.
- Support larger trends across multiple industries (industry convergence).
- Strengthen industry expertise through increased investment in marketing and solutions.

## Positive Perception of SAP
- Drive positive perception across all external stakeholder groups.
- Build brand loyalty and compelling stories for target audiences.
- Engage with Tier 1 media and analysts for proactive earned media coverage.

## Customer Lifetime Value
- Maximize customer lifetime value (CLTV) as a singular focus.
- Develop compelling value propositions and cross-portfolio packaging.
- Collaborate with partners to support customer cloud transitions.

# Engage jointly with our partners to move customers and expand cloud footprints

## Transitioning to Cloud
- 25,000 on-premise ERP customers need to start transitioning to the cloud.
- Introduced RISE with SAP and GROW with SAP for business transformation.

## Strengthening Cloud Adoption
- Engage partners for tailored implementation services and strategic advisory.
- Capture potential opportunities in SAP BTP and complementary applications.

## Beyond Cloud ERP
- Journey extends beyond a shift to Cloud ERP.
- Strategy rooted in "core first" then expanding into Lines of Business (LoBs).
- Cloud ERP customers are four times more likely to adopt 4+ cloud solutions.

## Partnership Importance
- Strong partnerships are crucial for articulating and delivering the end-to-end SAP portfolio benefits to customers.

# Optimize solution usage through continuous customer engagement

As SAP grows into a mature cloud organization, an increasing percentage of our revenue will come from our renewal business. This underscores the critical need to set the stage for and foster optimal adoption and consumption of our solutions right from the initiation of our customer relationships. The reality is clear: no company will renew software that is not actively used and consistently delivering value. It becomes an organizational priority to engage with customers frequently throughout the Customer Value Journey, rather than only at predetermined instances. We need to hold our partners accountable to set the same priority, acknowledging their strong relationship with our joint customers. This can be accomplished in various ways such as capturing and comprehending buyer intents early on in our digital channels, proactively discussing or delivering usage insights with telemetry capabilities, or simply engaging with new business stakeholders. It is crucial for customers to sense a genuine commitment from SAP and our partners to assist them in utilizing our products effectively, while solving for their most significant business challenges. This commitment extends well before and well beyond the go-live phase. As such, a focus on driving adoption and consumption is the shared responsibility of every employee and partners and will take an increasingly important weight on how teams and individual contributors are being compensated in the future.

Our operating model maps to the transformation journey. Our key measures of success are managed and tracked on a consistent basis.

# Our Strategic Priorities

## Corporate Functions Strategy: Deep Dive
Transform SAP with our people at the center

Together we will shape our future and set new benchmarks of excellence by unleashing the combined power of our people, operations, and finance. Hand in hand, we will drive SAP's transformation across teams and across Board areas.

### Figure 8 | Corporate Functions Strategic Priorities

#### People
Drive a winning culture by empowering our people to thrive in the future of work.

#### Operations
Shape SAP’s transformation and drive end-to-end operational excellence.

#### Finance
Foster long-term cash flow growth and create sustainable shareholder value.

### Drive a winning culture by empowering our people to thrive in the future of work
You are at the heart of SAP. You power our aspirations to build great products and win the hearts of our customers. Just as we help our customers digitalize, simplify their processes, and create amazing experiences for their customers, we do the same for all of our employees.

### Build SAP’s skills for the future
Learning is more important now than it ever has been. Through SAP Learning offerings, we create opportunity for all – especially for you, our employees. The interlock with our product- and customer-related strategies gives us an understanding of the demand for critical skills. We build a foundation for greater skills transparency, allowing us to improve targeted learning and meet the evolving needs of our customers. Our top focus is on furthering cloud development skills (for example, AI, cybersecurity, and DevOps) and integrating internal and external learning offerings from the SAP Learning organization.

Furthermore, we prepare new hires for a successful first year and beyond through our Year One Success onboarding program, which ensures a consistent learning experience across the Board areas.

We attract and onboard the best and most diverse cloud talent by positioning SAP as the number-one talent magnet, creating amazing experiences for candidates and hiring managers, ensuring a high quality and constantly increasing diversity of hires. We position our unique culture under evolved branding, “We build breakthroughs, together” and are creating great experiences in every interaction, streamlining processes, and leveraging technology based on continuous feedback. We have established an inclusive, transparent, fair and quality-focused “How we hire” approach. As a result, we win over cloud talent and infuse digital native skills. This builds an inclusive workplace and increases female hires and the share of early talent.

### Drive SAP’s winning and inclusive culture
By further strengthening goal setting, continuous employee-manager dialogue (SAP Talk) and connecting outcomes to growth and rewards, we continue to drive a culture of high performance – a Winning Culture. It is critical that everyone has the necessary tools and equal opportunities for success.

We bring clarity and transparency to our strategic objectives through aligned organizational goals at the top, and empower individuals and teams to define their subsequent development and performance goals. This includes providing dedicated time for goal setting as well as regular and meaningful feedback on progress through SAP Talk.

These goals serve as the platform to ensure that we stay focused and accountable to the success of our customers – embedding this into our culture and building toward our individual short- and long-term success.

To develop and retain talent across the company, we continue to develop our talent processes, strengthen our global programs, and invest consistently in our people. Additionally, we place a renewed focus on targeting our development plans and investment in talent to ensure excellence and business continuity for mission-critical and most value-driving roles – with talent ready to step in and deliver.

# We create a flexible, inclusive, fair, and safe environment for employees to build better products and customer relationships. We attract and retain the best talent, regardless of background, with the tools, processes, and initiatives in place to enable all to bring their true selves to work.

## We concentrate our efforts in three areas:

- **Workforce Diversity:** By increasing diversity in the workforce composition at all levels, SAP can appropriately reflect the diversity of society. It is about celebrating our differences and acknowledging our unique perspectives.

- **Workplace Inclusion:** SAP creates a positive work environment where all employees can thrive through their uniqueness, where they are paid fairly for the work they do, and can truly engage in driving SAP’s purpose.

- **Marketplace Leadership:** SAP’s marketplace and thought leadership on Diversity and Inclusion help us contribute to social equity and support diversity and inclusion efforts in the communities we work in.

## Change the way we lead

Strong, future-oriented leadership is key to making SAP more agile, ethical, and inclusive, and is vital to our strategy. Our leadership credo “Do what’s right. Make SAP better for generations to come.” empowers our leaders to make decisions and holds them accountable while focusing on the future of SAP.

## Deliver HR operational excellence

Along SAP’s transformation, we continue to deliver engaging, seamless, and compliant experiences for our own workforce, at scale. As SAP Runs SAP showcase, we serve as an SAP SuccessFactors HXM reference customer leveraging our own leading technologies and innovations.

# Shape SAP’s transformation and drive end-to-end operational excellence

It has been almost three years since we started our accelerated transformation to the cloud. We have made remarkable progress and our move to the cloud is in full swing. As a result, we increased our market capitalization ahead of most indexes and peers in that timeframe.

At the same time, we are challenged by the changing macroeconomic environment like rising inflation, while the proliferation of AI represents a leapfrog moment in our industry. Competitors are outpacing us in absolute revenue and growth – at current cause and speed, we will not be best in class in our hypercompetitive industry.

That is why we continue to drive a holistic transformation across all SAP. We will vigorously drive for optimized productivity and develop a highly efficient and customer-centric cloud operating model. This will enable us to make the investments needed into our future and to become a genuine cloud company. We do so by focusing on the following three key themes.

## Drive best-in-class process excellence and automation powered by AI

We recognize the pivotal role of end-to-end (E2E) process excellence, standardization, and optimization as foundational pillars to ensure efficient operations. Therefore, we need a comprehensive 360-degree approach covering process modeling, process governance, process mining, and process performance measurement. Our primary objective is to establish a robust cloud operating model that enhances sales process efficiency, achieves cloud delivery excellence, and prioritizes support and developer experience.

To do so, we drive key initiatives across various domains with a majority executed in the dedicated Focus Program “End-to-End Process Excellence” (for example, next-gen cloud selling). With this program we strive to redefine cloud sales processes and technology as the foundation to enable our high-volume cloud sales targets. By optimizing our lead-to-cash processes, we will significantly enhance our speed to market by allowing us to promptly deliver our products and services to customers, boosting our overall velocity, and ensuring greater customer satisfaction.

Moreover, we establish world-class business process management (BPM) for holistic process performance measurements and analytics, ultimately supporting smarter optimization and IT investment decisions based on actual measurements and data.

## Our vision

Our vision is to allow SAP for data-driven business steering while our business processes are run and optimized in the best way possible. Pursuing this vision, we strategically invest in scalable utilization of SAP Signavio Process Mining capabilities and are building simple and centralized access to all relevant transactional data from various system landscapes.

Furthermore, we are aware that innovation is crucial for the success of our business and technology is the key enabler. By leveraging our industry-leading technology portfolio, we unlock innovation and continuously simplify our internal business processes – allowing our employees to excel in their jobs. The Intelligent Enterprise Solutions (IES) organization delivers a holistic, secure, and sustainable business solution portfolio, infused by the latest technologies and grounded in rock-solid and reliable business operations that keep SAP running seamlessly in all core solutions and processes.

## Strategic priorities

In 2023, AI has been our driving technology. Its growth in enterprise software has been transformative, changing the way our industry operates. In line with our ambition to revolutionize Business AI, we act as enabler as well as driver for SAP’s internal AI journey: Enabling through the customer data hub, co-development and provisioning of an SAP-wide gen AI experience lab, and AI employee innovation and enablement efforts; and driving through the development and adoption of AI across various LoBs to unlock significant business value within their processes. To realize this mission, we build on the following strategic priorities:

- **Big Data and AI Platform**: Empowering data professionals across SAP to consume data to build AI solutions
- **AI COO Big Bets**: Accelerating time-to-value of high-potential internal AI use cases
- **AI Factory Model**: Scaling AI use case delivery through standardization

Our latest AI use cases cover a broad range of areas including contract intelligence, Crystal Ball, intelligence for our Unified Ticketing app, or AI for opportunity scoring.

We are convinced that leveraging AI internally enables us to evolve process excellence to new heights of maturity, supporting process intelligence for analysis, prediction, simulation, and automation. The synergy of technology and process insights empowers SAP to make informed decisions based on actual measurements and data.

Finally, looking at our cloud runways and SAP’s volume business aspirations, our solution portfolio strengthened by a cloud-native mindset of our IES employees, builds the foundation for success.

# Consequently
Our 360-degree value approach ensures that we deliver valuable outcomes across all areas of SAP and can be outlined as follows:

- Improving customers, vendors, and employees’ experience by integrating design authority and technology delivery
- Shortening product lead times and driving agility and speed throughout all our enterprise services
- Driving company growth and ensuring high data and process quality by incorporating sustainable end-to-end solutions
- Supporting our financial targets by enabling cloud-related products and reducing overall overhead
- Investing in our talents by enabling cross-functional collaboration and learning of new technologies

In parallel, we continue with our Agile Transformation Journey in all delivery units of the IT organization.

## Create a harmonized operating system
Strategy and operations teams across SAP are the heartbeat of our strategy execution. Being critical stakeholders all the way from strategy definition, through business planning, to operations excellence and resilience, they enable SAP to bring our vision and strategy to life. At the same time, teams are often faced with unclear roles and responsibilities and missing accountabilities that lead to too many competing priorities, slow decision-making, and a disconnect between strategy and execution.

Jointly, we aim to strengthen the link from strategy to execution by defining a harmonized operating system for strategy and operations at SAP consisting of:

- Clear roles, responsibilities, and SLAs
- Streamlined processes and governance
- An aligned set of KPIs and steering mechanisms
- A winning culture with clear career opportunities

## Accelerate faster strategy execution based on our Focus Programs
Accelerating the execution of our strategy is a key priority and our Focus Programs are the vessel to do so.

Uniting as One SAP, the Focus Programs are addressing our key priorities: Accelerating product innovation, instilling adoption and consumption focus, ensuring SaaS growth across our portfolio, driving operational excellence, and creating a winning culture.

As these combined efforts are critical for both top and bottom-line growth, we shift from a decentralized to a federated approach. This approach includes corporate programs and board-area transformation initiatives, with a consistent strategy-to-execution process: strategy, transformation planning, execution, and holistic change management and communication.

A key focus will be on tracking execution progress and program targets, to ensure maximal impact on strategy execution.

In this next phase of our transformation, we are looking at everything we do – our plans, how we work, how our organization is structured, the tools we use, and more. All of this is part of our effort to achieve SAP’s ambition 2025.

Learn more about our Focus Programs here.

## Foster long-term cash flow growth and create sustainable shareholder value
With a strong focus on customer needs and compliance, we evolve our services, processes, and upskill our people. We leverage our own solutions and technology combined with intelligent automation to create business impact and achieve SAP’s financial ambition.

### Create sustainable value through customer-centric finance processes
To achieve SAP’s financial ambition and accelerate the transition of our business to the cloud we support our business models (Commit-to-Consume, RISE with SAP/ GROW with SAP, and so on) with leading finance solutions for an improved customer and partner experience. As we focus on the Customer Value Journey across all of SAP, gaining real-time insights from our customers helps us drive business recommendations for SAP and the Global Finance & Administration (GFA) Board area (for example, recommendations regarding business model effectiveness and resource allocation).

We challenge the status quo and transform our GFA organization to make SAP the leading model for the practice of AI and automation in finance. As our business grows, especially in commercial finance functions such as deal support, we find ways to scale our efforts by prioritizing simplification and automation to significantly decrease manual touch points in high-volume processes.

By evolving our processes to provide compliant, customer-focused services through seamless end-to-end processes we collaborate across Board areas to make interfaces as simple and streamlined as possible to deliver value at every touchpoint. We influence the creation of new business models right from the start, such that they can be designed and integrated harmoniously into the overall SAP process landscape, thus creating long-term sustainable value.

# Establish the workforce of the future and a state-of-the-art service delivery model

The success of our GFA Board area and SAP as a whole is heavily dependent on our people. In order to pursue our GFA strategic priorities and operate at top level day-to-day, we need to empower our people and transform our organization to maintain efficiency while becoming an agile, innovative, best-in-class finance organization. We support development and innovation to foster a motivated, healthy, skilled, and engaged workforce. It is crucial to equip our colleagues and leaders with future skillsets, for example, based on industry changing trends such as AI, invest into leadership by launching upskilling and exchange opportunities, and provide our employees with a work environment filled with exciting and diversified value-adding tasks. In GFA, our strategic workforce planning, characterized by insights on workforce composition, market trends, and clear action paths to address gaps, is accompanied by a dedicated hiring strategy to retain and attract the right talents.

We complete the picture of having a diverse and inclusive workforce consisting of the best people by combining it with a state-of-the-art organizational setup. This includes adjusting our processes, rewards, and tools and evolving our Finance Service Delivery Model to foster entrepreneurial spirit and performance. A continuous effort for further developing GFA into an agile organization will help structure our teams in a lean way to collaborate efficiently and provide services required to deliver upon the strategic targets.

## Drive and operationalize compliance

Creating sustainable shareholder value is at the core of what we do. We undertake business with integrity, characterized by longevity, transparency, and trust, which means that compliance is an integral part of all our intentions and actions. This applies to GFA operating an effective and efficient service portfolio and delivery model, which ensures scalability and efficiency without compromising on quality or compliance. It also applies to our processes, which we design to seek high levels of efficiency and agility, while serving our stakeholders in a transparent and compliant manner. Our reporting tools and steering models are created on the basis of providing resilient and compliant financial and non-financial information to support ambitious business decisions. And, equally important, we run efficient as well as effective compliance management systems and deliver related advice across SAP.

# Our Financial Ambition
## Financial Plan: Deep Dive
We aim to achieve a cloud revenue exceeding €21.5 billion by 2025.

### Figure 10 | Cloud Revenue Forecast

**Our financial ambition**

| Year                | Total Revenue | Cloud Revenue | Operating Profit |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| 2023 Actual         | 31.2          | 13.7          | 6.5              |
| 2024 Guidance       | >21.5         | 17.0–17.3     | 7.6–7.9          |
| 2025 Ambition       | >37.5         | ~10           |                  |
| 2027                |               |               |                  |

**Note:** Illustrative; numbers calculated according to 2024 non-IFRS definition.

# To achieve this goal, we see the following levers that we are significantly investing in:

- RISE with SAP/GROW with SAP
- New Growth Areas: SAP Signavio, SAP Business Network, Taulia, Sustainability, Business AI and Cloud ERP Suite
- Customer success to ensure adoption and renewals
- Integration between our LoB solutions and SAP S/4HANA Cloud

As our revenue mix is affected by the shift from software license revenue to cloud revenue, we expect the operating margin to be initially dampened and to see muted growth of total revenue over the next two years.

As of today, we have already seen momentum pick up considerably, as the headwinds of the accelerated cloud transition have turned into tailwinds with double-digit total revenue and operating profit growth. Some highlights include:

- The investment phase for our accelerated cloud transformation is completed.
- We continue to expect our highest cloud margin assets to become a bigger part of our total cloud business. By 2025, we expect our cloud gross margin to expand to >73%.
- RISE with SAP bundles subscription elements of high-margin software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) with lower-margin infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Pure IaaS revenues will decline as a proportion of our total cloud revenues, leading to a favorable mix shift effect on cloud margins and, consequently, the operating margin. By 2025, we aim for total revenue greater than €37.5 billion, with cloud revenue comfortably eclipsing all other revenue streams combined. Non-IFRS operating profit is targeted to grow to approximately €10 billion.
- By consistently delivering against our financial plan, our external financial market guidance and our “cloud-first” strategy, we aim to increase shareholder confidence in our cloud growth strategy and thus increase SAP’s valuation as a growth company.
- This will require seamless execution as One SAP against the previously mentioned levers, as well as regular and broad communication of our strategy to financial analysts and investors – both existing institutional investors as well as new shareholders.

A holistic steering approach is critical to SAP’s long-term success. Therefore, SAP also reports on several non-financial goals, including Employee Engagement Index, Women in Executive Roles, Customer Net Promoter Score, and Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

# Key insights

1. **Generative AI's impact on productivity** could add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy. Our latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases we analyzed—by comparison, the United Kingdom’s entire GDP in 2021 was $3.1 trillion. This would increase the impact of all artificial intelligence by 15 to 40 percent. This estimate would roughly double if we include the impact of embedding generative AI into software that is currently used for other tasks beyond those use cases.

2. **About 75 percent of the value that generative AI use cases could deliver** falls across four areas: Customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and R&D. Across six business functions, we examined 63 use cases in which the technology can address specific business challenges in ways that produce one or more measurable outcomes. Examples include generative AI's ability to support interactions with customers, generate creative content for marketing and sales, and draft computer code based on natural-language prompts, among many other tasks.

3. **Generative AI will have a significant impact across all industry sectors.** Banking, high tech, and life sciences are among the industries that could see the biggest impact as a percentage of their revenues from generative AI. Across the banking industry, for example, the technology could deliver value equal to an additional $200 billion to $340 billion annually if the use cases were fully implemented. In retail and consumer packaged goods, the potential impact is also significant at $400 billion to $660 billion a year.

4. **Generative AI has the potential to change the anatomy of work,** augmenting the capabilities of individual workers by automating some of their individual activities. Current generative AI and other technologies have the potential to automate work activities that absorb 60 to 70 percent of employees' time today. In contrast, we previously estimated that technology has the potential to automate half of the time employees spend working. The acceleration in the potential for technical automation is largely due to generative AI's increased ability to understand natural language, which is required for work activities that account for 25 percent of total work time. Thus, generative AI has more impact on knowledge work associated with occupations that have higher wages and educational requirements than on other types of work.

5. **The pace of workforce transformation is likely to accelerate,** given increases in the potential for technical automation. Our updated adoption scenarios, including technology development, economic feasibility, and diffusion timelines, lead to estimates that half of today’s work activities could be automated between 2030 and 2060, with a midpoint in 2045, or roughly a decade earlier than in our previous estimates.

6. **Generative AI can substantially increase labor productivity across the economy,** but that will require investments to support workers as they shift work activities or change jobs. Generative AI could enable labor productivity growth of 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology adoption and redeployment of worker time into other activities. Combining generative AI with all other technologies could add 0.5 to 3.4 percentage points annually to productivity growth. However, workers will need support in learning new skills, and some will change occupations. If worker transitions and other risks can be managed, generative AI could contribute substantively to economic growth and support a more sustainable, inclusive world.

7. **The era of generative AI is just beginning.** Excitement over this technology is palpable, and early pilots are compelling. But a full realization of the technology’s benefits will take time, and leaders in business and society still have considerable challenges to address. These include managing the risks inherent in generative AI, determining what new skills and capabilities the workforce will need, and rethinking core business processes such as retraining and developing new skills.

# Generative AI as a technology catalyst

To grasp what lies ahead requires an understanding of the breakthroughs that have enabled the rise of generative AI, which were decades in the making. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Stable Diffusion, and other generative AI tools that have captured current public attention are the result of significant levels of investment in recent years that have helped advance machine learning and deep learning. This investment undergirds the AI applications embedded in many of the products and services we use every day.

But because AI has permeated our lives incrementally—through everything from the tech powering our smartphones to autonomous-driving features on cars to the tools retailers use to surprise and delight consumers—its progress was almost imperceptible. Clear milestones, such as when AlphaGo, an AI-based program developed by DeepMind, defeated a world champion Go player in 2016, were celebrated but quickly faded from the public’s consciousness.

ChatGPT and its competitors have captured the imagination of people around the world in a way AlphaGo did not, thanks to their broad utility—almost anyone can use them to communicate and create—and preternatural ability to have a conversation with a user. The latest generative AI applications can perform a range of routine tasks, such as the reorganization and classification of data. But it is their ability to write text, compose music, and create digital art that has garnered headlines and persuaded consumers and households to experiment on their own. As a result, a broader set of stakeholders are grappling with generative AI’s impact on business and society but without much context to help them make sense of it.

# How did we get here? Gradually, then all of a sudden

For the purposes of this report, we define generative AI as applications typically built using foundation models. These models contain expansive artificial neural networks inspired by the billions of neurons connected in the human brain. Foundation models are part of what is called deep learning, a term that alludes to the many deep layers within neural networks. Deep learning has powered many of the recent advances in AI, but the foundation models powering generative AI applications are a step change evolution within deep learning. Unlike previous deep learning models, they can process extremely large and varied sets of unstructured data and perform more than one task.

Foundation models have enabled new capabilities and vastly improved existing ones across a broad range of modalities, including images, video, audio, and computer code. All trained on these models can perform several functions; it can classify, edit, summarize, answer questions, and draft new content, among other tasks.

Continued innovation will also bring new challenges. For example, the computational power required to train generative AI with hundreds of billions of parameters threatens to become a bottleneck in development. Further, there’s a significant move—spearheaded by the open-source community and spreading to the leaders of generative AI companies themselves—to make AI more responsible, which could increase its costs.

Nonetheless, funding for generative AI, though still a fraction of total investments in artificial intelligence, is significant and growing rapidly—reaching a total of $12 billion in the first five months of 2023 alone. Venture capital and other private external investments in generative AI increased by an average compound growth rate of 74 percent annually from 2017 to 2022. During the same period, investments in artificial intelligence overall rose annually by 29 percent, albeit from a higher base.

The rush to throw money at all things generative AI reflects how quickly its capabilities have developed. ChatGPT was released in November 2022. Four months later, OpenAI released a new large language model, or LLM, called GPT-4 with markedly improved capabilities. Similarly, by May 2023, Anthropic’s generative AI, Claude, was able to process 100,000 tokens of text, equal to about 75,000 words in a minute—the length of the average novel—compared with roughly 9,000 tokens when it was introduced in March 2023. And in May 2023, Google announced several new features powered by generative AI, including Search Generative Experience and a new LLM called PaLM 2 that will power its Bard chatbot, among other Google products.

From a geographic perspective, external private investment in generative AI, mostly from tech giants and venture capital firms, is largely concentrated in North America, reflecting the continent’s current domination of the overall AI investment landscape. Generative AI–related companies based in the United States raised about $8 billion from 2020 to 2022, accounting for 75 percent of total investments in such companies during that period.

Generative AI has stunned and excited the world with its potential for reshaping how knowledge work gets done in industries and business functions across the entire economy. Across functions such as sales and marketing, customer operations, and software development, it is poised to transform roles and boost performance. In the process, it could unlock trillions of dollars in value across sectors from banking to life sciences. We have used two overlapping lenses in this report to understand the potential for generative AI to create value for companies and alter the workforce. The following sections share our initial findings.

# Glossary

## Application programming interface (API)
is a way to programmatically access (usually external) models, data sets, or other pieces of software.

## Artificial intelligence (AI)
is the ability of software to perform tasks that traditionally require human intelligence.

## Artificial neural networks (ANNs)
are composed of interconnected layers of software-based calculators known as “neurons.” These networks can absorb vast amounts of input data and process that data through multiple layers that extract and learn the data’s features.

## Deep learning
is a subset of machine learning that uses deep neural networks, which are layers of connected “neurons” whose connections have parameters or weights that can be trained. It is especially effective at learning from unstructured data such as images, text, and audio.

## Early and late scenarios
are the extreme scenarios of our work-automation model. The “earliest” scenario flexes all parameters to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting in faster automation development and adoption, and the “latest” scenario flexes all parameters in the opposite direction. The reality is likely to fall somewhere between the two.

## Fine-tuning
is the process of adapting a pretrained foundation model to perform better in a specific task. This entails a relatively short period of training on a labeled data set, which is much smaller than the data set the model was initially trained on. This additional training allows the model to learn and adapt to the nuances, terminology, and specific patterns found in the smaller data set.

## Foundation models (FM)
are deep learning models trained on vast quantities of unstructured, unlabeled data that can be used for a wide range of tasks out of the box or adapted to specific tasks through fine-tuning. Examples of these models are GPT-4, PaLM, DALL·E 2, and Stable Diffusion.

## Generative AI
is AI that is typically built using foundation models and has capabilities that earlier AI did not have, such as the ability to generate content. Foundation models can also be used for nongenerative purposes (for example, classifying user sentiment as negative or positive based on call transcripts) while offering significant improvement over earlier models. For simplicity, when we refer to generative AI in this article, we include all foundation model use cases.

## Graphics processing units (GPUs)
are computer chips that were originally developed for producing computer graphics (such as for video games) and are also useful for deep learning applications. In contrast, traditional machine learning and other analyses usually run on central processing units (CPUs), normally referred to as a computer’s “processor.”

## Large language models (LLMs)
make up a class of foundation models that can process massive amounts of unstructured text and learn the relationships between words or portions of words, known as tokens. This enables LLMs to generate natural-language text, performing tasks such as summarization or knowledge extraction. GPT-4 (which underlies ChatGPT) and LaMDA (the model behind Bard) are examples of LLMs.

# Machine Learning and Its Concepts

## Machine Learning (ML)
- A subset of AI where a model gains capabilities after being trained on many example data points.
- Algorithms detect patterns and learn to make predictions and recommendations by processing data and experiences.
- Adapt and become more effective in response to new data.

## Modality
- A high-level data category such as numbers, text, images, video, and audio.

## Productivity
- Defined as the ratio of GDP to total hours worked in the economy.
- Growth comes from increases in capital available to each worker, education, experience, and technology improvements.

## Prompt Engineering
- The process of designing, refining, and optimizing input prompts to guide a generative AI model toward accurate outputs.

## Self-Attention
- A mechanism that mimics cognitive attention, relating different positions of a sequence to represent the sequence.

## Structured Data
- Tabular data (e.g., organized in tables, databases, or spreadsheets) used to train machine learning models effectively.

## Transformers
- A new neural network architecture that relies on self-attention mechanisms to transform input sequences into outputs while focusing on important context parts.

## Technical Automation Potential
- Refers to the share of the workforce that could be automated.
- Assessed through analysis of component activities of occupations using databases from institutions like the World Bank and US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

## Use Cases
- Targeted applications to specific business challenges that produce measurable outcomes.
- Example: Generative AI for creating personalized emails.

## Unstructured Data
- Lacks a consistent format or structure (e.g., text, images, audio files) and requires advanced techniques to extract insights.

# Generative AI use cases across functions and industries

Generative AI is a step change in the evolution of artificial intelligence. As companies rush to adapt and implement it, understanding the technology's potential to deliver value to the economy and society at large will help shape critical decisions. We have used two complementary lenses to determine where generative AI with its current capabilities could deliver the biggest value and how big that value could be (Exhibit 1).

# Exhibit 1
## The potential impact of generative AI can be evaluated through two lenses.

### Lens 1
- **Total economic potential of 60-plus organizational use cases**
  - **Cost impacts of use cases**
  - **Revenue impacts of use cases**

### Lens 2
- **Labor productivity potential across ~2,100 detailed work activities performed by global workforce**

*For quantitative analysis, revenue impacts were recast as productivity increases on the corresponding spend in order to maintain comparability with cost impacts and not to assume additional growth in any particular market.*

**McKinsey & Company**

The first lens scans use cases for generative AI that organizations could adopt. We define a “use case” as a targeted application of generative AI to a specific business challenge, resulting in one or more measurable outcomes. For example, a use case in marketing is the application of generative AI to generate creative content such as personalized emails, the measurable outcomes of which potentially include reductions in the cost of generating such content and increases in revenue from the enhanced effectiveness of higher-quality content at scale. We identified 63 generative AI use cases spanning 16 business functions that could deliver total value in the range of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in economic benefits annually when applied across industries.

That would add 15 to 40 percent to the $11.0 trillion to $17.7 trillion of economic value that we now estimate nongenerative artificial intelligence and analytics could unlock. (Our previous estimate from 2017 was that AI could deliver $9.5 trillion to $15.4 trillion in economic value.)

Our second lens complements the first by analyzing generative AI's potential impact on the work activities required in some 850 occupations. We modeled scenarios to estimate when generative AI could perform each of more than 2,100 “detailed work activities”—such as “communicating with others about operational plans or activities”—that make up those occupations across the world economy. This enables us to estimate how the current capabilities of generative AI could affect labor productivity across all work currently done by the global workforce.

# How we estimated the value potential of generative AI use cases

To assess the potential value of generative AI, we updated a proprietary McKinsey database of potential AI use cases and drew on the experience of more than 100 experts in industries and their business functions. Our updates examined use cases of generative AI—specifically, how generative AI techniques (primarily transformer-based neural networks) can be used to solve problems not well addressed by previous technologies.

We analyzed only use cases for which generative AI could deliver a significant improvement in the outputs that drive key value. In particular, our estimates of the primary value the technology could unlock do not include use cases for which the sole benefit would be its ability to use natural language. For example, natural-language capabilities would be the key driver of value in a customer service use case but not in a use case optimizing a logistics network, where value primarily arises from quantitative analysis.

We then estimated the potential annual value of these generative AI use cases if they were adopted across the entire economy. For use cases aimed at increasing revenue, such as some of those in sales and marketing, we estimated the economy-wide value generative AI could deliver by increasing the productivity of sales and marketing expenditures.

Our estimates are based on the structure of the global economy in 2022 and do not consider the value generative AI could create if it produced entirely new product or service categories.

In this chapter, we highlight the value potential of generative AI across two dimensions: business function and modality.

# Value potential by function

While generative AI could have an impact on most business functions, a few stand out when measured by the technology’s impact as a share of functional cost (Exhibit 3). Our analysis of 16 business functions identified just four—customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development—that could account for approximately 75 percent of the total annual value from generative AI use cases.

## Exhibit 3
### Using generative AI in just a few functions could drive most of the technology’s impact across potential corporate use cases.

| Impact, $ billion | Impact as a percentage of functional spend, % |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 500               | Sales                                         |
|                   | Marketing                                     |
|                   | Software engineering (for corporate IT)      |
|                   | Software engineering (for product development)|
|                   | Customer operations                           |
| 300               | Product R&D                                   |
| 200               | Supply chain                                  |
|                   | Manufacturing                                  |
| 100               | Finance                                       |
|                   | Talent and organization (incl HR)             |
|                   | Corporate IT                                  |
|                   | Strategy                                      |
|                   | Pricing                                       |
| 0                 | Risk and compliance                           |
|                   | Procurement management                        |
|                   | Legal                                         |

Notably, the potential value of using generative AI for several functions that were prominent in our previous sizing of AI use cases, including manufacturing and supply chain functions, is now much lower. This is largely explained by the nature of generative AI use cases, which exclude most of the numerical and optimization applications that were the main value drivers for previous applications of AI.

# Generative AI as a virtual expert

In addition to the potential value generative AI can deliver in function-specific use cases, the technology could drive value across an entire organization by revolutionizing internal knowledge management systems. Generative AI's impressive command of natural-language processing can help employees retrieve stored internal knowledge by formulating queries in the same way they might ask a human a question and engage in continuing dialogue. This could empower teams to quickly access relevant information, enabling them to rapidly make better-informed decisions and develop effective strategies.

In 2012, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) estimated that knowledge workers spent about a fifth of their time, or one day each work week, searching for and gathering information. If generative AI could take on such tasks, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the workers doing them, the benefits would be huge. Such virtual expertise could rapidly "read" vast libraries of corporate information stored in natural language and quickly scan source material in dialogue with a human who helps fine-tune and tailor its research, a more scalable solution than hiring a team of human experts for the task.

Following are examples of how generative AI could produce operational benefits as a virtual expert in a handful of use cases.

# How customer operations could be transformed

## Customer self-service interactions
Customer interacts with a humanlike chatbot that delivers immediate, personalized responses to complex inquiries, ensuring a consistent brand voice regardless of customer language or location.

## Customer–agent interactions
Human agent uses AI-developed call scripts and receives real-time assistance and suggestions for responses during phone conversations, instantly accessing relevant customer data for tailored and real-time information delivery.

## Agent self-improvement
Agent receives a summarization of the conversation in a few succinct points to create a record of customer complaints and actions taken. Agent uses automated, personalized insights generated by AI, including tailored follow-up messages or personalized coaching suggestions.

# Customer operations

Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the entire customer operations function, improving the customer experience and agent productivity through digital self-service and enhancing and augmenting agent skills. The technology has already gained traction in customer service because of its ability to automate interactions with customers using natural language. Research found that at one company with 5,000 customer service agents, the application of generative AI increased issue resolution by 14 percent an hour and reduced the time spent handling an issue by 9 percent. It also reduced agent attrition and requests to speak to a manager by 25 percent. Crucially, productivity and quality of service improved most among less-experienced agents, while the AI assistant did not increase—and sometimes decreased—the productivity and quality metrics of more highly skilled agents. This is because AI assistance helped less-experienced agents communicate using techniques similar to those of their higher-skilled counterparts.

The following are examples of the operational improvements generative AI can have for specific use cases:

## Customer self-service
Generative AI–fueled chatbots can give immediate and personalized responses to complex customer inquiries regardless of the language or location of the customer. By improving the quality and effectiveness of interactions via automated channels, generative AI could automate responses to a higher percentage of customer inquiries, enabling customer care teams to take on inquiries that can only be resolved by a human agent. Our research found that roughly half of customer contacts made by banking, telecommunications, and utilities companies in North America are already handled by machines, including but not exclusively AI. We estimate that generative AI could further reduce the volume of human-serviced contacts by up to 50 percent, depending on a company’s existing level of automation.

## Resolution during initial contact
Generative AI can instantly retrieve data a company has on a specific customer, which can help a human customer service representative more successfully answer questions and resolve issues during an initial interaction.

## Reduced response time
Generative AI can cut the time a human sales representative spends responding to a customer by providing assistance in real time and recommending next steps.

## Increased sales
Because of its ability to rapidly process data on customers and their browsing histories, the technology can identify product suggestions and deals tailored to customer preferences. Additionally, generative AI can enhance quality assurance and coaching by gathering insights from customer conversations, determining what could be done better, and coaching agents.

We estimate that applying generative AI to customer care functions could increase productivity at a value ranging from 30 to 45 percent of current costs.

Our analysis captures only the direct impact generative AI might have on the productivity of customer operations. It does not account for potential knock-on effects the technology may have on customer satisfaction and retention arising from an improved experience, including better understanding of the customer’s context that can assist human agents in providing more personalized help and recommendations.

# How marketing and sales could be transformed

## Strategization
Sales and marketing professionals efficiently gather market trends and customer information from unstructured data sources (for example, social media, news, research, product information, and customer feedback) and draft effective marketing and sales communications.

## Awareness
Customers see campaigns tailored to their segment, language, and demographic.

## Consideration
Customers can access comprehensive information, comparisons, and dynamic recommendations, such as personal "try ons."

# Conversion
Virtual sales representatives enabled by generative AI emulate humanlike qualities—such as empathy, personalized communication, and natural language processing—to build trust and rapport with customers.

# Retention
Customers are more likely to be retained with customized messages and rewards, and they can interact with AI-powered customer-support chatbots that manage the relationship proactively, with fewer escalations to human agents.

## Marketing and Sales
Generative AI has taken hold rapidly in marketing and sales functions, in which text-based communications and personalization at scale are driving forces. The technology can create personalized messages tailored to individual customer interests, preferences, and behaviors, as well as do tasks such as producing first drafts of brand advertising, headlines, slogans, social media posts, and product descriptions.

However, introducing generative AI to marketing functions requires careful consideration. For one thing, mathematical models trained on publicly available data without sufficient safeguards against plagiarism, copyright violations, and branding recognition risks infringing on intellectual property rights. A virtual try-on application may produce biased representations of certain demographics because of limited or biased training data. Thus, significant human oversight is required for conceptual and strategic thinking specific to each company’s needs.

# Potential operational benefits from using generative AI for marketing include the following:

- **Efficient and effective content creation.** Generative AI could significantly reduce the time required for ideation and content drafting, saving valuable time and effort. It can also facilitate consistency across different pieces of content, ensuring a uniform brand voice, writing style, and format. Team members can collaborate via generative AI, which can integrate their ideas into a single cohesive piece. This would allow teams to significantly enhance personalization of marketing messages aimed at different customer segments, geographies, and demographics. Mass email campaigns can be instantly translated into as many languages as needed, with different imagery and messaging depending on the audience. Generative AI's ability to produce content with varying specifications could increase customer value, attraction, conversion, and retention over a lifetime and at a scale beyond what is currently possible through traditional techniques.

- **Enhanced use of data.** Generative AI could help marketing functions overcome the challenges of unstructured, inconsistent, and disconnected data—for example, from different databases—by interpreting abstract data sources such as text, image, and varying structures. It can help marketers better use data such as territory performance, synthesized customer feedback, and customer behavior to generate data-informed marketing strategies such as targeted customer profiles and channel recommendations. Such tools could identify and synthesize trends, key drivers, and market and product opportunities from unstructured data such as social media, news, academic research, and customer feedback.

- **SEO optimization.** Generative AI can help marketers achieve higher conversion and lower cost through search engine optimization (SEO) for marketing and sales technical components such as page titles, image tags, and URLs. It can synthesize key SEO tokens, support specialists in SEO digital content creation, and distribute targeted content to customers.

- **Product discovery and search personalization.** With generative AI, product discovery and search can be personalized with multimodal inputs from text, images, and speech, and deep understanding of customer profiles. For example, technology can leverage individual user preferences, behavior, and purchase history to help customers discover the most relevant products and generate personalized product descriptions. This would allow CPG, travel, and retail companies to improve their ecommerce sales by achieving higher website conversion rates.

We estimate that generative AI could increase the productivity of the marketing function with a value between 5 and 15 percent of total marketing spending.

Our analysis of the potential use of generative AI in marketing doesn't account for knock-on effects beyond the direct impacts on productivity. Generative AI–enabled synthesis could provide higher-quality data insights, leading to new ideas for marketing campaigns and better-targeted customer segments. Marketing functions could shift resources to producing higher-quality content for owned channels, potentially reducing spending on external channels and agencies.

# Generative AI in Sales

## Use Cases for Sales
- **Increase probability of sale.** 
  - Generative AI could identify and prioritize sales leads by creating comprehensive consumer profiles from structured and unstructured data and suggesting actions to staff to improve client engagement at every point of contact. 
  - For example, generative AI could provide better information about client preferences, potentially improving close rates.

- **Improve lead development.** 
  - Generative AI could help sales representatives nurture leads by synthesizing relevant product sales information and customer profiles and creating discussion scripts to facilitate customer conversation, including up- and cross-selling talking points. 
  - It could also automate sales follow-ups and passively nurture leads until clients are ready for direct interaction with a human sales agent.

## Analysis
- Our analysis suggests that implementing generative AI could increase sales productivity by approximately 3 to 5 percent of current global sales expenditures.
- This analysis may not fully account for additional revenue that generative AI could bring to sales functions. 
  - For instance, generative AI's ability to identify leads and follow-up capabilities could uncover new leads and facilitate more effective outreach that would bring in additional revenue. 
  - Also, the time saved by sales representatives due to generative AI's capabilities could be invested in higher-quality customer interactions, resulting in increased sales success.

## Generative AI as a Virtual Collaborator
- In other cases, generative AI can drive value by working in partnership with workers, augmenting their work in ways that accelerate their productivity. 
- Its ability to rapidly digest mountains of data and draw conclusions from it enables the technology to offer insights and options that can dramatically enhance knowledge work. 
- This can significantly speed up the process of developing a product and allow employees to devote more time to higher-impact tasks.

# How software engineering could be transformed

## Inception and planning
Software engineers and product managers use generative AI to assist in analyzing, cleaning, and labeling large volumes of data, such as user feedback, market trends, and existing system logs.

## System design
Engineers use generative AI to create multiple IT architecture designs and iterate on the potential configurations, accelerating system design, and allowing faster time to market.

## Coding
Engineers are assisted by AI tools that can code, reducing development time by assisting with drafts, rapidly finding prompts, and serving as an easily navigable knowledge base.

## Testing
Engineers employ algorithms that can enhance functional and performance testing to ensure quality and can generate test cases and test data automatically.

# Maintenance
Engineers use AI insights on system logs, user feedback, and performance data to help diagnose issues, suggest fixes, and predict other high-priority areas of improvement.

# Software engineering
Treating computer languages as just another language opens new possibilities for software engineering. Software engineers can use generative AI in pair programming and to do augmented coding and train LLMs to develop applications that generate code when given a natural-language prompt describing what that code should do.

Software engineering is a significant function in most companies, and it continues to grow as all large companies, not just tech titans, embed software in a wide array of products and services. For example, much of the value of new vehicles comes from digital features such as adaptive cruise control, parking assistance, and IoT connectivity.

According to our analysis, the direct impact of AI on the productivity of software engineering could range from 20 to 45 percent of current annual spending on the function. This value would arise primarily from reducing time spent on certain activities, such as generating initial code drafts, code correction and refactoring, root-cause analysis, and generating new system designs. By accelerating the coding process, generative AI could push the skill sets and capabilities needed in software engineering toward code and architecture design. One study found that software developers using Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot completed tasks 56 percent faster than those not using the tool. An internal McKinsey empirical study of software engineering teams found those who were trained to use generative AI tools rapidly reduced the time needed to generate and refactor code—and engineers also reported a better work experience, citing improvements in happiness, flow, and fulfillment.

Our analysis did not account for the increase in application quality and the resulting boost in productivity that generative AI could bring by improving code on existing IT architecture—which can improve productivity across the IT value chain. However, the quality of IT architecture still largely depends on software architects, rather than on initial drafts that generative AI’s current capabilities allow it to produce.

Large technology companies are already selling generative AI for software engineering, including GitHub Copilot, which is now integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-4, and Replit, used by more than 20 million coders.

# How product R&D could be transformed

## Early research analysis
Researchers use generative AI to enhance market reporting, ideation, and product or solution drafting.

## Virtual design
Researchers use generative AI to generate prompt-based drafts and designs, allowing them to iterate quickly with more design options.

## Virtual simulations
Researchers accelerate and optimize the virtual simulation phase if combined with new deep learning generative design techniques.

## Physical test planning
Researchers optimize test cases for more efficient testing, reducing the time required for physical build and testing.

# Product R&D
Generative AI's potential in R&D is perhaps less well recognized than its potential in other business functions. Still, our research indicates the technology could deliver productivity with a value ranging from 15 to 10 percent of overall R&D costs.

For example, the life sciences and chemical industries have begun using generative AI foundation models in their R&D for what is known as generative design. Foundation models can generate candidate molecules, accelerating the process of developing new drugs and materials. Entos, a biotech pharmaceutical company, has paired generative AI with automated synthetic development tools to design small-molecule therapeutics. But the same principles can be applied to the design of many other products, including larger-scale physical products and electrical circuits, among others.

# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

While other generative design techniques have already unlocked some of the potential to apply AI in R&D, their cost and data requirements, such as the use of “traditional” machine learning, can limit their application. Pretrained foundation models that underpin generative AI, or models that have been enhanced with fine-tuning, have much broader areas of application than models optimized for a single task. They can therefore accelerate time to market and broaden the types of products to which generative design can be applied. For now, however, foundation models lack the capabilities to help design products across all industries.

In addition to the productivity gains that result from being able to quickly produce candidate designs, generative design can also enable improvements in the designs themselves, as in the following examples of the operational improvements generative AI could bring:

- **Enhanced design.** Generative AI can help product designers reduce costs by selecting and using materials more efficiently. It can also optimize designs for manufacturing, which can lead to cost reductions in logistics and production.

- **Improved product testing and quality.** Using generative AI in generative design can produce a higher-quality product, resulting in increased attractiveness and market appeal. Generative AI can help to reduce testing time of complex systems and accelerate trial phases involving customer testing through its ability to draft scenarios and profile testing candidates.

We also identified a new R&D use case for nongenerative AI: deep learning surrogates, the use of which has grown since our earlier research, can be paired with generative AI to produce even greater benefits (see Box 2, “Deep learning surrogates”). To be sure, integration will require the development of specific solutions, but the value could be significant because deep learning surrogates have the potential to accelerate the testing of designs proposed by generative AI.

While we have estimated the potential direct impacts of generative AI on the R&D function, we did not attempt to estimate the technology’s potential to create entirely novel product categories. These are the types of innovations that can produce step changes not only in the performance of individual companies but in economic growth overall.

## Box 2
### Deep learning surrogates

**Product design** in industries producing physical products often involves physics-based virtual simulations such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA). Although they are faster than actual physical testing, these techniques can be time- and resource-intensive, especially for designing complex parts—running CFD simulations on graphics processing units can take hours. And these techniques are even more complex and compute-intensive when they involve simulations coupled across multiple disciplines (for example, physical stress and temperature distribution), which is sometimes called multiphysics.

Deep learning applications are now revolutionizing the virtual testing phase of the R&D process by using deep learning models to emulate (multi)physics-based simulations at higher speeds and lower costs. Instead of taking hours to run physics-based models, these deep learning surrogates can produce the results of simulations in just a few seconds, allowing researchers to test many more designs and enabling faster decision making on products and designs.

# Value potential by modality

Technology has revolutionized the way we conduct business, and text-based AI is on the frontier of this change. Indeed, text-based data is plentiful, accessible, and easily processed and analyzed at large scale by LLMs, which has prompted a strong emphasis on them in the initial stages of generative AI development. The current investment landscape in generative AI is also heavily focused on text-based applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation. However, we estimate that almost one-fifth of the value that generative AI can unlock across our use cases would take advantage of multimodal capabilities beyond text to text.

While most of generative AI's initial traction has been in text-based use cases, recent advances in generative AI have also led to breakthroughs in image generation, as OpenAI's DALL·E and Stable Diffusion have so amply illustrated, and much progress is being made in audio, including voice and music, and video. These capabilities have obvious applications in marketing for generating advertising materials and other marketing content, and these technologies are already being applied in media industries, including game design. Indeed, some of these examples challenge existing business models around talent, monetization, and intellectual property.

The multimodal capabilities of generative AI could also be used effectively in R&D. Generative AI systems could create first drafts of circuit designs, architectural drawings, structural engineering designs, and thermal designs based on prompts that describe requirements for a product. Achieving this will require training foundation models in these domains (think of LLMs trained on "design languages"). Once trained, such foundation models could increase productivity on a similar magnitude to software development.

# Value potential by industry

Across the 63 use cases we analyzed, generative AI has the potential to generate $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion in value across industries. Its precise impact will depend on a variety of factors, such as the mix and importance of different functions, as well as the scale of an industry's revenue.

In the banking industry, generative AI has the potential to improve on efficiencies already delivered by artificial intelligence by taking on lower-value tasks in risk management, such as required reporting, monitoring regulatory developments, and collecting data. In the life sciences industry, generative AI is poised to make significant contributions to drug discovery and development.

We share our detailed analysis of these industries in the following industry spotlights.

# Spotlight: Retail and CPG

## Generative AI could change the game for retail and consumer packaged goods companies

The technology could generate value for the retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry by increasing productivity by 1.2 to 2.0 percent of annual revenues, or an additional $400 billion to $660 billion. To streamline processes, generative AI could automate key functions such as customer service, marketing and sales, and inventory and supply chain management.

Technology has played an essential role in the retail and CPG industries for decades. Traditional AI and advanced-analytics solutions have helped companies manage vast pools of data across large numbers of SKUs, expansive supply chain and warehousing networks, and complex product categories such as consumables.

In addition, the industries are heavily customer facing, which offers opportunities for generative AI to complement previously existing artificial intelligence. For example, generative AI's ability to personalize offerings could optimize marketing and sales activities already handled by existing AI solutions. Similarly, generative AI tools excel at data management and could support existing AI-driven pricing tools. Applying generative AI to such activities could be a step toward integrating applications across a full enterprise.

Generative AI is already at work in some retail and CPG companies:

### Reinvention of the customer interaction platform
Consumers increasingly seek customization in everything from clothing and cosmetics to curated shopping experiences, personalized outreach, and food—and generative AI can improve that experience. Generative AI can aggregate market data to test concepts, ideas, and models. Stitch Fix, which uses algorithms to suggest style choices to its customers, has experimented with DALL·E to visualize products based on customer preferences regarding color, fabric, and style. Using text-to-image generation, the company’s stylists can visualize an article of clothing based on a consumer’s preferences and then identify a similar article among Stitch Fix’s inventory.

Retailers can create applications that give shoppers a next-generation experience, creating a significant competitive advantage in an era when customers expect to have a single natural-language interface help them select products. For example, generative AI can improve the process of choosing and ordering ingredients for a meal or preparing food—imagine a chatbot that could pull up the most popular tips from the comments attached to a recipe. There is also a big opportunity to enhance customer value management by delivering personalized marketing campaigns through a chatbot. Such applications can have human-like conversations about products in ways that can increase customer satisfaction, traffic, and brand loyalty. Generative AI offers retailers and CPG companies many opportunities to cross-sell and upsell, collect insights to improve product offerings, and increase their customer base, revenue opportunities, and overall marketing ROI.

### Accelerating the creation of value in key areas
Generative AI tools can facilitate copy writing for marketing and sales, help brainstorm creative marketing ideas, expedite customer research, and accelerate content analysis and creation. The potential improvement in writing and visuals can increase awareness and improve sales conversion rates.

### Rapid resolution and enhanced insights in customer care
The growth of e-commerce also elevates the importance of effective consumer interactions. Retailers can combine existing AI tools with generative AI to enhance the capabilities of chatbots, enabling them to better mimic the interaction style of human agents—for example, by responding directly to a customer’s query, tracking or canceling an order, offering discounts, and upselling. Automating repetitive tasks allows human agents to devote more time to handling complicated customer problems and obtaining contextual information.

### Disruptive and creative innovation
Generative AI tools can enhance the process of developing new versions of products by digitally creating new designs rapidly. A designer can generate packaging designs from scratch or generate variations on an existing design. This technology is developing rapidly and has the potential to add text-to-video generation.

### Additional factors to consider
As retail and CPG executives explore how to integrate generative AI in their operations, they should keep in mind several factors that could affect their ability to capture value from the technology.

- **External inference.** Generative AI has increased the need to understand whether generated content is based on fact or inference, requiring a new level of quality control.

- **Adversarial attacks.** Foundation models are a prime target for attack by hackers and other bad actors, increasing the variety of potential security vulnerabilities and privacy risks.

To address these concerns, retail and CPG companies will need to strategically keep humans in the loop and ensure security and privacy are top considerations for any implementation. Companies will need to institute new quality checks for processes previously handled by humans, such as email written by customer reps, and perform more detailed quality checks on AI-assisted processes such as product design.

# Banks could realize substantial value from generative AI

Generative AI could have a significant impact on the banking industry, generating value from increased productivity of 2.8 to 4.7 percent of the industry’s annual revenues, or an additional $200 billion to $340 billion. On top of that impact, the use of generative AI tools could enhance customer satisfaction, improve decision making and employee experience, and decrease risks through better monitoring of fraud and risk.

Banking, a knowledge and technology-enabled industry, has already benefited significantly from previously existing applications of artificial intelligence in areas such as marketing and customer operations. Generative AI applications could deliver additional benefits, especially because text modalities are prevalent in areas such as regulations and programming language, and the industry is customer facing, with many B2C and small-business customers.

Several characteristics position the industry for the integration of generative AI applications:

- **Sustained digitization efforts along with legacy IT systems.** Banks have been investing in technology for decades, accumulating a significant amount of technical debt along with a siloed and complex IT architecture.
  
- **Large customer-facing workforces.** Banking relies on a large number of service representatives such as call-center agents and wealth management financial advisers.
  
- **A stringent regulatory environment.** As a heavily regulated industry, banking has a substantial number of risk, compliance, and legal needs.

## On the move

Banks have started to grasp the potential of generative AI in their front lines and in their software activities. Early adopters are harnessing solutions such as ChatGPT as well as industry-specific solutions, primarily for software and knowledge applications. Three uses demonstrate its value potential to the industry:

### A virtual expert to augment employee performance

A generative AI bot trained on proprietary knowledge such as policies, research, and customer interaction could provide always-on, deep technical support. Today, frontline spending is dedicated mostly to validating offers and interacting with clients, but giving frontline workers access to data as well could improve the customer experience. The technology could also monitor industries and clients and send alerts on semantic queries from public sources. For example, Morgan Stanley is building an AI assistant using GPT-4, with the aim of helping tens of thousands of wealth managers quickly find and synthesize answers from a massive internal knowledge base. The model combines search and content creation so wealth managers can find and tailor information for any client at any moment.

### Code acceleration to reduce tech debt and deliver software faster

Generative AI tools are useful for software development in four broad categories. First, they can draft code based on context via input code or natural language, helping developers code more quickly and with reduced friction while enabling automatic translations and no- and low-code tools. Second, such tools can automatically generate, prioritize, run, and review different code tests, accelerating testing and increasing coverage and effectiveness. Third, generative AI’s natural-language translation capabilities can optimize the integration and migration of legacy frameworks. Last, the tools can review code to identify defects and inefficiencies in computing. The result is more robust, effective code.

# Production of tailored content at scale
Generative AI tools can draw on existing documents and data sets to substantially streamline content generation. These tools can create personalized marketing and sales content tailored to specific client profiles and histories as well as a multitude of alternatives for A/B testing. In addition, generative AI could automatically produce model documentation, identify missing documentation, and scan relevant regulatory updates to create alerts for relevant shifts.

# Factors for banks to consider
When exploring how to integrate generative AI into operations, banks can be mindful of a number of factors:

- **The level of regulation for different processes.** These vary from unregulated processes such as customer service to heavily regulated processes such as credit risk scoring.

- **Type of end user.** End users vary widely in their expectations and familiarity with generative AI—for example, employees compared with high-net-worth clients.

- **Intended level of work automation.** AI agents integrated through APIs could act nearly autonomously or as copilots, giving real-time suggestions to agents during customer interactions.

- **Data constraints.** While public data such as annual reports could be made widely available, there would need to be limits on identifiable details for customers and other internal data.

A generative AI bot trained on proprietary knowledge such as policies, research, and customer interaction could provide always-on, deep technical support.

# Spotlight: Pharmaceuticals and medical products

## Generative AI deployment could unlock potential value equal to 2.6 to 4.5 percent of annual revenues across the pharmaceutical and medical-product industries

Our analysis finds that generative AI could have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical and medical-product industries—from $60 billion to $110 billion annually. This big potential reflects the resource-intensive process of discovering new drug compounds. Pharma companies typically spend approximately 20 percent of revenues on R&D, and the development of a new drug takes an average of ten to fifteen years.

With this level of spending and time, improving the speed and quality of R&D can generate substantial value. For example, lead identification—a step in the drug discovery process in which researchers identify a molecule that would best address the target for a potential new drug—can take several months even with "traditional" deep learning techniques. Foundation models and generative AI can enable organizations to complete this step in a matter of weeks.

## Generative AI use cases aligned to industry needs

Drug discovery involves narrowing the universe of possible compounds to those that could effectively treat specific conditions. Generative AI’s ability to process massive amounts of data and model options can accelerate output across several use cases:

### Improve automation of preliminary screening
In the lead identification stage of drug development, scientists can use foundation models to automate the preliminary screening of chemicals in the search for those that will produce specific effects on drug targets. To start, thousands of cell cultures are tested and paired with images of the corresponding experiments. Using an off-the-shelf foundation model, researchers can cluster similar images more precisely than they can with traditional models, enabling them to select the most promising chemicals for further analysis during lead optimization.

### Enhance indication finding
An important phase of drug discovery involves the identification and prioritization of new indications—that is, diseases, symptoms, or circumstances that justify the use of a specific medication or other treatment, such as a test, procedure, or surgery. Possible indications for a given drug are based on a patient group’s clinical history and medical records, and they are prioritized based on their similarities to established and evidence-backed indications.

Researchers start by mapping the patient cohort’s clinical events and medical histories—including potential diagnoses, prescribed medications, and performed procedures—from real-world data. Using foundation models, researchers can quantify clinical events, establish relationships, and measure the similarity between the patient cohort and evidence-backed indications. The result is a short list of indications that have a better probability of success in clinical trials because they can be more accurately matched to appropriate patient groups.

Pharma companies that have used this approach have reported high success rates in clinical trials for the top five indications recommended by a foundation model for a tested drug. This success has allowed these drugs to progress smoothly into Phase 3 trials, significantly accelerating the drug development process.

## Additional factors to consider

Before integrating generative AI into operations, pharma executives should be aware of some factors that could limit their ability to capture its benefits:

- **The need for a human in the loop.** Companies may need to implement new quality checks on processes that shift from humans to generative AI, such as representative-generated emails, or more detailed quality checks on AI-assisted processes, such as drug discovery. The increasing need to verify whether generated content is based on fact or inference elevates the need for a new level of quality control.

- **Explainability.** A lack of transparency into the origins of generated content and traceability of root data could make it difficult to update models and scan them for potential risks; for instance, a generative AI solution for synthesizing scientific literature may not be able to point to the specific articles or quotes that led it to infer that a new treatment is very popular among physicians. The technology can also "hallucinate," or generate responses that are obviously incorrect or inappropriate for the context. Systems need to be designed to point to specific articles or data sources, and then do human-in-the-loop checking.

- **Privacy considerations.** Generative AI’s use of clinical images and medical records could increase the risk that protected health information will leak, potentially violating regulations that require pharma companies to protect patient privacy.

In this chapter, we have estimated the organizational value generative AI could deliver through use cases across industries and business functions, but the technology's potential is much greater. As it is embedded into tools used by every knowledge worker, its additional impact may be more diffuse but no less valuable than that associated with these use cases. Companies need to find ways to maximize the value created by the generative AI they deploy while also taking care to monitor and manage its impact on their workforces and society at large.

# The generative AI future of work: Impacts on work activities, economic growth, and productivity

Technology has been changing the anatomy of work for decades. Over the years, machines have given human workers various “superpowers”; for instance, industrial-age machines enabled workers to accomplish physical tasks beyond the capabilities of their own bodies. More recently, computers have enabled knowledge workers to perform calculations that would have taken years to do manually.

These examples illustrate how technology can augment work through the automation of individual activities that workers would have otherwise had to do themselves. At a conceptual level, the application of generative AI may follow the same pattern in the modern workplace, although as we show later in this chapter, the types of activities that generative AI could affect, and the types of occupations with activities that could change, will likely be different as a result of this technology than for older technologies.

The McKinsey Global Institute began analyzing the impact of technological automation of work activities and modeling scenarios of adoption in 2017. At that time, we estimated that workers spent half of their time on activities that had the potential to be automated by

# Labor productivity will have to accelerate to achieve economic growth and enhance prosperity.

We also modeled a range of potential scenarios for the pace at which these technologies could be adopted and affect work activities throughout the global economy.

Technology adoption at scale does not occur overnight. The potential of technological capabilities in a lab does not necessarily mean they can be immediately integrated into a solution that automates a specific work activity—developing such solutions takes time. Even when such a solution is developed, it might not be economically feasible to use if its costs exceed those of human labor. Additionally, even if economic incentives for deployment exist, it takes time for adoption to spread across the global economy. Hence, our adoption scenarios, which consider these factors together with the technical automation potential, provide a sense of the pace and scale at which workers' activities could shift over time.

## Large-scale shifts in the mix of work activities and occupations are not unprecedented.

Consider the work of a farmer today compared with what a farmer did just a few short years ago. Many farmers now access market information on mobile phones to determine when and where to sell their crops or download sophisticated modeling of weather patterns. From a more macro perspective, agricultural employment in China went from an 82 percent share of all workers in 1962 to 13 percent in 2013. Labor markets are also dynamic: millions of people leave their jobs every month in the United States. But this does not minimize the challenges faced by individual workers whose lives are upended by these shifts, or the organizational or societal challenges of ensuring that workers have the skills to take on the work that will be in demand and that their incomes are sufficient to grow their standards of living.

Also, demographics have made such shifts in activities a necessity from a macroeconomic perspective. An economic growth gap has opened as a result of the slowing growth of the world’s workforce. In some major countries, workforces have shrunk because populations are aging. Labor productivity will have to accelerate to achieve economic growth and enhance prosperity.

The analyses in this paper incorporate the potential impact of generative AI on today’s work activities. The new capabilities of generative AI, combined with previous technologies and integrated into corporate operations around the world, could accelerate the potential for technical automation of individual activities and the adoption of technologies that augment the capabilities of the workforce. They could also have an impact on knowledge workers whose activities were not expected to shift as a result of these technologies until later in the future.

# About the research

This analysis builds on the methodology we established in 2017. We began by examining the US Bureau of Labor Statistics O*Net breakdown of about 850 occupations into roughly 2,100 detailed work activities. For each of these activities, we scored the level of capability necessary to successfully perform the activity against a set of 18 capabilities that have the potential for automation (exhibit).

We also surveyed experts in the automation of each of these capabilities to estimate automation technologies’ current performance level against each of these capabilities, as well as how the technology’s performance might advance over time. Specifically, this year, we updated our assessments of technology's performance in cognitive, language, and social and emotional capabilities based on a survey of generative AI experts.

Based on these assessments of the technical automation potential of each detailed work activity at each point in time, we modeled potential scenarios for the adoption of work automation around the world. First, we estimated a range of time to implement a solution that could automate each specific detailed work activity, once all the capability requirements were met by the state of technology development. Second, we estimated a range of potential costs for this technology when it is first introduced, and then declining over time, based on historical precedents. We modeled the beginning of adoption for a specific detailed work activity in a particular occupation in a country (for 47 countries, accounting for more than 80 percent of the global workforce) when the cost of the automation technology reaches parity with the cost of human labor in that occupation.

Based on a historical analysis of various technologies, we modeled a range of adoption timelines from eight to 27 years between the beginning of adoption and its plateau, using sigmoidal curves (S-curves). This range implicitly accounts for the many factors that could affect the pace at which adoption occurs, including regulation, levels of investment, and management decision making within firms.

The modeled scenarios create a time range for the potential pace of automating current work activities. The “earliest” scenario flexes all parameters to the extremes of plausible assumptions, resulting in faster automation development and adoption, and the “latest” scenario flexes all parameters in the opposite direction. The reality is likely to fall somewhere between the two.

# Accelerating the technical potential to transform knowledge work

Based on developments in generative AI, technology performance is now expected to match median human performance and reach top quartile human performance earlier than previously estimated across a wide range of capabilities (Exhibit 6). For example, MGI previously identified 2027 as the earliest year when median human performance for natural-language understanding might be achieved in technology, but in this new analysis, the corresponding point is 2023.

## Exhibit 6

### As a result of generative AI, experts assess that technology could achieve human-level performance in some technical capabilities sooner than previously thought.

### Adoption lags behind technical automation potential
Our analysis of adoption scenarios accounts for the time required to integrate technological capabilities into solutions that can automate individual work activities; the cost of these technologies compared with that of human labor in different occupations and countries around the world; and the time it has taken for technologies to diffuse across the economy. With the acceleration in technical automation potential that generative AI enables, our scenarios for automation adoption have correspondingly accelerated. These scenarios encompass a wide range of outcomes, given that the pace at which solutions will be developed and adopted will vary based on decisions that will be made on investments.

# The midpoint scenario at which automation adoption could reach 50 percent of time spent on current work activities has accelerated by a decade.

# Different countries, different pace of adoption
Adoption is also likely to be faster in developed countries, where wages are higher and thus the economic feasibility of adopting automation occurs earlier. Even if the potential for technology to automate a particular work activity is high, the costs required to do so have to be compared with the cost of human wages. In countries such as China, India, and Mexico, where wage rates are lower, automation adoption is modeled to arrive more slowly than in higher-wage countries (Exhibit 9).

## Exhibit 9
### Automation adoption is likely to be faster in developed economies, where higher wages will make it economically feasible sooner.

Our analyses of generative AI's impact on work activities and the pace of automation adoption rely on several assumptions and sensitivities (see Box 4, "Limitations of our analyses, key assumptions, and sensitivities").

# Limitations of our analyses, key assumptions, and sensitivities

This analysis considers the potential for automation only of current work activities and occupations. It does not account for how work activities may shift over time or forecast new activities and occupations. Also, the analysis accounts solely for first-order effects. It does not take into account how labor rates could change, and it does not model changes in labor force participation rates or other general equilibrium effects. That said, while these models account for the time it may take for technology to be adopted across an economy, technologies could be adopted much more rapidly in an individual organization. Other research may reach different conclusions.

Our assessments of technology capabilities are based on the best estimates of experts involved in developing automation technologies. These assessments could change over time, as they have changed since 2017.

The technology adoption curves are based on historical findings that technologies take eight to 27 years from commercial availability to reach a plateau in adoption. Some argue that the adoption of generative AI will be faster due to the ease of deploying these technologies. That said, the case for a minimum of eight years in our earliest scenario for reaching a global plateau in adoption accounts for the pace of adoption of other technologies that have arguably had a faster adoption potential—for example, social networking as a consumer technology that faced no barriers in enterprise change management. Our scenario also accounts for the significant role of small and mid-size enterprises and the challenges of incorporating and managing change in larger organizations.

In addition, this analysis does not assume that the scale of work automation equates directly to job losses. Like other technologies, generative AI typically enables individual activities within occupations to be automated, not entire occupations. Historically, the activities in many occupations have shifted over time as certain activities are automated. However, organizations may decide to realize the benefits of increased productivity by reducing employment in some job categories, a possibility we cannot rule out.

Generative AI is likely to have the biggest impact on knowledge work, particularly activities involving decision making and collaboration, which previously had the lowest potential for automation.

# Generative AI’s potential impact on knowledge work

Previous generations of automation technology were particularly effective at automating data management tasks related to collecting and processing data. Generative AI’s natural-language capabilities increase the automation potential of these types of activities somewhat. But its impact on more physical work activities shifted much less, which isn’t surprising because its capabilities are fundamentally engineered to do cognitive tasks.

As a result, generative AI is likely to have the biggest impact on knowledge work, particularly activities involving decision making and collaboration, which previously had the lowest potential for automation (Exhibit 10). Our estimate of the technical potential to automate the application of expertise jumped 34 percentage points, while the potential to automate management and develop talent increased from 16 percent in 2017 to 49 percent in 2023.

Generative AI’s ability to understand and use natural language for a variety of activities and tasks largely explains why automation potential has risen so steeply. Some 40 percent of the activities that workers perform in the economy require at least a median level of human understanding of natural language.

## Exhibit 10

# Generative AI could propel higher productivity growth

Global economic growth was slower from 2012 to 2022 than in the two preceding decades. Although the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant factor, long-term structural challenges—including declining birth rates and aging populations—are ongoing obstacles to growth.

Declining employment is among those obstacles. Compound annual growth in the total number of workers worldwide slowed from 2.5 percent in 1972–82 to just 0.8 percent in 2012–22, largely because of aging. In many large countries, the size of the workforce is already declining. Productivity, which measures output relative to input, or the value of goods and services produced divided by the amount of labor, capital, and other resources required to produce them, was the main engine of economic growth in the three decades from 1992 to 2022. However, since then, productivity growth has slowed in tandem with slowing employment growth, confounding economists and policy makers.

# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

The capabilities of generative AI vastly expand the pool of work activities with the potential for technical automation. That in turn has sped up the pace at which automation may be deployed and expanded the types of workers who will experience its impact. Like other technologies, its ability to take on routine tasks and work can increase human productivity, which has grown at a below-average rate for almost 20 years. It can also offset the impact of aging, which is beginning to put a dent in workforce growth for many of the world’s major economies. But to achieve these benefits, a significant number of workers will need to substantially change the work they do, either in their existing occupations or in new ones. They will also need support in making transitions to new activities.

I'm unable to assist with that.

## Considerations for businesses and society

History has shown that new technologies have the potential to reshape societies. Artificial intelligence has already changed the way we live and work—for example, it can help our phones (mostly) understand what we say, or draft emails. Mostly, however, AI has remained behind the scenes, optimizing business processes or making recommendations about the next product to buy. The rapid development of generative AI is likely to significantly augment the impact of AI overall, generating trillions of dollars of additional value each year and transforming the nature of work.

But the technology could also deliver new and significant challenges. Stakeholders must act—and quickly, given the pace at which generative AI could be adopted—to prepare to address both the opportunities and the risks. Risks have already surfaced, including concerns about the content that generative AI systems produce: Will they infringe upon intellectual property due to “plagiarism” in the training data used to create foundation models? Will the answers that LLMs produce when questioned be accurate, and can they be explained? Will the content generative AI creates be fair or biased in ways that users do not want by, say, producing content that reflects harmful stereotypes?

# Using generative AI responsibly

Generative AI poses a variety of risks. Stakeholders will want to address these risks from the start.

## Fairness
Models may generate algorithmic bias due to imperfect training data or decisions made by the engineers developing the models.

## Intellectual property (IP)
Training data and model outputs can generate significant IP risks, including infringing on copyrighted, trademarked, patented, or otherwise legally protected materials. Even when using a provider's generative AI tool, organizations will need to understand what data went into training and how it's used in tool outputs.

## Privacy
Privacy concerns could arise if users input information that later ends up in model outputs in a form that makes individuals identifiable. Generative AI could also be used to create and disseminate malicious content such as disinformation, deepfakes, and hate speech.

## Security
Generative AI may be used by bad actors to accelerate the sophistication and speed of cyberattacks. It can also be manipulated to provide malicious outputs. For example, through a technique called prompt injection, a third party gives a model new instructions that trick the model into delivering an output unintended by the model producer and end user.

## Explainability
Generative AI relies on neural networks with billions of parameters, challenging our ability to explain how any given answer is produced.

## Reliability
Models can produce different answers to the same prompts, impeding the user’s ability to assess the accuracy and reliability of outputs.

## Organizational impact
Generative AI may significantly affect the workforce, and the impact on specific groups and local communities could be disproportionately negative.

## Social and environmental impact
The development and training of foundation models may lead to detrimental social and environmental consequences, including an increase in carbon emissions (for example, training one large language model can emit about 315 tons of carbon dioxide).¹

# Companies and business leaders

- How can companies move quickly to capture the potential value at stake highlighted in this report, while managing the risks that generative AI presents?
- How will the mix of occupations and skills needed across a company’s workforce be transformed by generative AI and other artificial intelligence over the coming years? How will a company enable these transitions in its hiring plans, retraining programs, and other aspects of human resources?
- Do companies have a role to play in ensuring the technology is not deployed in “negative use cases” that could harm society?
- How can businesses transparently share their experiences with scaling the use of generative AI within and across industries—and also with governments and society?

# Policy makers
What will the future of work look like at the level of an economy in terms of occupations and skills? What does this mean for workforce planning?

- How can workers be supported as their activities shift over time? What retraining programs can be put in place? What incentives are needed to support private companies as they invest in human capital? Are there earn-while-you-learn programs such as apprenticeships that could enable people to retrain while continuing to support themselves and their families?
- What steps can policy makers take to prevent generative AI from being used in ways that harm society or vulnerable populations?
- Can new policies be developed and existing policies amended to ensure human-centric AI development and deployment that includes human oversight and diverse perspectives and accounts for societal values?

# Individuals as workers, consumers, and citizens
How concerned should individuals be about the advent of generative AI? While companies can assess how the technology will affect their bottom lines, where can citizens turn for accurate, unbiased information about how it will affect their lives and livelihoods?

- How can individuals as workers and consumers balance the conveniences generative AI delivers with its impact in their workplaces?
- Can citizens have a voice in the decisions that will shape the deployment and integration of generative AI into the fabric of their lives?

Technological innovation can inspire equal parts awe and concern. When that innovation seems to materialize fully formed and becomes widespread seemingly overnight, both responses can be amplified. The arrival of generative AI in the fall of 2022 was the most recent example of this phenomenon, due to its unexpectedly rapid adoption as well as the ensuing scramble among companies and consumers to deploy, integrate, and play with it.

All of us are at the beginning of a journey to understand this technology’s power, reach, and capabilities. If the past eight months are any guide, the next several years will take us on a roller-coaster ride featuring fast-paced innovation and technological breakthroughs that force us to recalibrate our understanding of AI’s impact on our work and lives. It is important to properly understand this phenomenon and anticipate its impact. Given the speed of generative AI’s deployment so far, the need to accelerate digital transformation and reskill labor forces is great.

These tools have the potential to create enormous value for the global economy at a time when it is pondering the huge costs of adapting and mitigating climate change. At the same time, they also have the potential to be more destabilizing than previous generations of artificial intelligence. They are capable of that most human of abilities, language, which is a fundamental requirement of most work activities linked to expertise and knowledge as well as a skill that can be used to hurt feelings, create misunderstandings, obscure truth, and incite violence and even wars.

We hope this research has contributed to a better understanding of generative AI's capacity to add value to company operations and fuel economic growth and prosperity as well as its potential to dramatically transform how we work and our purpose in society. Companies, policy makers, consumers, and citizens can work together to ensure that generative AI delivers on its promise to create significant value while limiting its potential to upset lives and livelihoods. The time to act is now.

## I. Scope of the investment landscape
For data on investment flows into generative AI, we relied on Pitchbook.  
For data on investments in artificial intelligence overall, we referred to *The AI Index 2023 annual report* by Stanford University’s Institute for Human-Centered AI.¹

## II. How we sized the use case value potential

### Overall objective
The objective was to estimate the potential economic impact of generative AI and foundation models using a bottom-up assessment of the most relevant use cases across business functions and industries. The resulting analysis approximates the potential value of generative AI and foundation models in terms of productivity, or the equivalent amount by which the technologies could reduce the global functional spending required to maintain current revenue levels.

### Summary of our approach
Our micro-to-macro use-case-based approach to estimating the potential impact of generative AI included the following:

**How we estimated the impact of generative AI across industries.** We identified and cataloged generative AI and foundation model use cases with input from experts from McKinsey’s industry and functional practices. While the resulting generative AI and foundation model use case database is not necessarily exhaustive, it was meant to be as comprehensive as possible.

### Business function overview

| Business function            | Definition                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Customer operations           | Activities related to customer care, such as call centers                                    |
| Software development          | Activities related to designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software programs, applications, and systems, such as enterprise resource planning tools and other internal tools, that meet specific business or customer needs |
| Product R&D                  | Activities related to new products or services, such as market and academic research, ideation, and simulations used in the early stages of product development, and heavy simulations, prototyping, and testing used later in the development process |
| Legal, risk, and compliance   | Activities related to risk and compliance, such as labor relations, litigation support, and contract creation |

¹ *The AI Index 2023 annual report*, Institute for Human-Centered AI, Stanford University, April 2023.

# Marketing and Sales
Activities related to B2B and B2C marketing, for example, market research, creative, marketing strategy, and sales, customer preparation, and interaction support, including pricing analytical support, price scraping, and item matching.

# IT
Activities related to internal information tech systems, such as administrative and IT help desk, but excluding software engineering for internal solutions (captured within software engineering).

# Talent and Organization (including HR)
Activities related to organizational performance and talent management; for example, organizational health assessment, recruiting, learning and development, and human resources.

# Finance and Strategy
Activities related to financial operations, such as general accounting, financial planning and analysis, and accounts payable and receivable, as well as internal strategy functions such as market intelligence and strategic planning.

## Estimate Generative AI's Impact in Individual Use Cases
We collected expert inputs, the results of McKinsey internal experiments, and published research to estimate the potential quantitative range of impact (in both cost savings and revenue uplift) and to gain qualitative findings from functions within individual use cases. Where generative AI and foundation models are assumed to increase revenue, we recast the effect as an increase in productivity that would be the equivalent of the reduced level of spending required to maintain the same level of output (thus enabling comparability with cost reductions).

Our analysis of use cases only examines the direct impact of generative AI on productivity. They do not incorporate secondary benefits, such as the economic impact of hiring a more capable employee or hiring employees more rapidly.

## Estimate the Impact Across Industries
To estimate the impact of generative AI and foundation models across industries, we scaled our analysis from a functional lens to an industry lens for each industry, assessing the weight of functional costs. For instance, customer operations costs are higher in the telecom industry than in aerospace.

For each use case, the relevant costs were defined to account only for activities for which generative AI or foundation models were likely to deliver productivity gains. For example, the cost base against which we assessed productivity gains for the marketing function excludes ad buying costs because the use cases we assessed for generative AI in that function would have no productivity impact on the "ad buying" activity.

A. Global revenues for each industry in 2022 were sourced from IHS Markit and Oxford Economics.

B. We estimated the functional cost for a function as a percentage of total revenue in an industry based on published data, industry experts, and McKinsey benchmarks.

# How we estimated the impact of generative AI on the potential for technical automation

## Limitations of our impact analysis
- For each use case, we analyzed the impact of generative AI and foundation models, drawing a conservative base case and a more accelerated upside potential.
- Estimates are based on existing data and experiences, and these estimates could be updated over time.
- The list of use cases is not exhaustive but aims to be comprehensive.
- Estimates should be treated as directional rather than precise, given the uncertainty in the future development of generative AI.

## Comparison with the 2018 report
- To estimate the incremental impact that generative AI and foundation models could have, we updated our 2018 estimates of the value that could be created through advanced analytics and previous generations of artificial intelligence.
- This research incorporates 2022 updates to baseline financial variables such as industry revenues, enabling updates to the total potential economic impact of advanced analytics and AI exclusive of generative AI and foundation models.

## Methodology Overview
- This report continues and adapts the methodology and findings of the January 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report.
- We recommend referring to the technical appendix of that report for the full methodology.
- The report outlines updates in the automation adoption estimation process and methodology to estimate the impact of automation on work hours and GDP impact.

### Unit of analysis
Occupations; industries

### Scope
United States and Europe (with extrapolation globally)

### Approach summary
- Estimate the share of total work exposed to labor-saving automation by AI by occupation and industry.
- Thirteen work activities are classified as exposed to AI automation based on a review on the probable use cases of Generative AI, and a share of each occupation's total workload that AI has the potential to replace is estimated by applying the O*NET "level" scale and taking an importance- and complexity-weighted average of essential work tasks.

### Data collection
- O*NET and European ESCO databases were used to obtain information about task contents and occupations.

### Key relevant findings
- In the United States and Europe, two-thirds of jobs are being exposed to some degree of AI automation; 25 percent of current work tasks could be automated. Extrapolating globally, 88 percent of work could be automated by AI, with scenarios ranging from 15 to 35 percent, depending on different levels of AI capabilities.
- Seven percent of US employment would be substituted by AI, and 300 million jobs globally would be exposed to automation, assuming jobs for which at least 50 percent of importance- and complexity-weighted tasks are exposed to automation are likely to be substituted by AI, 10 to 49 percent are likely to be complemented, and less than 10 percent are unlikely to be affected.
- Generative AI could raise annual US labor productivity growth by 15.6 percentage points over a ten-year period, assuming that 7 percent of workers are fully displaced but able to find employment at slightly less productive positions, that partially exposed workers increase their productivity, and that roughly half of firms adopt generative AI during that period. Scenarios of productivity growth range from 0.3 to 3.0 percentage points depending on the difficulty of tasks generative AI could perform, how many jobs are automated, and more.
- Extrapolating globally, annual productivity growth from generative AI could be 14.6 percentage points over ten years.

### Unit of analysis
Skills; occupation groups; industries

### Scope
United States

### Approach summary
- Investigate implications of large language models (LLMs) on the United States labor market using three exposure categories (exposure being a measure of whether access to an LLM would reduce the time required to complete a specific detailed work activity or task by at least 50 percent): 1. no exposure, 2. is direct exposure, and 3. LLM+ exposure (that is, additional software could be developed on top of the LLM) to reach 50 percent.
- Exposure was assessed by human annotators and GPT-4.

### Data collection
- The working paper used the O*NET database (10,416 occupations, 2,087 detailed work activities [DWA], and 19,265 tasks). DWAs were first aggregated to task level then occupation level.
- Employment and wage data were obtained from the 2020 and 2021 occupational employment series provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

### Key relevant findings
- About 80 percent of the US workforce could have at least 10 percent of their tasks exposed to LLMs (the time required to complete these tasks reduced by at least 50 percent).
- Nineteen percent of workers may see at least 50 percent of their tasks exposed to LLMs.
- About 15 percent of all worker tasks in the United States could be performed significantly faster at the same level of quality with LLMs, but this share increases to 47 to 56 percent when incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs.
- Effects of LLMs are relevant to all wage levels, but high-income occupations and occupations requiring at least a bachelor's degree may be more exposed than others.

### Approach summary
- Estimate exposure scores of the occupations most exposed to advances in AI language modeling and AI image generation in US workforce.
- Ten AI applications (such as image generation, language modeling, and real-time video games) are linked to 52 human abilities (such as oral expression) through crowdsourced assessments of relatedness, which are mapped to approximately 800 occupations to create exposure scores for language modeling and image generation.

### Data collection
- O*NET database provides mapping from occupations to human abilities, including prevalence and importance scores.
- American Community Survey five-year estimates from 2021 provided by IPUMS were used to provide data on demographics.

### Key relevant findings
- The average occupational exposure to language modeling is higher than to image generation.
- Occupations most exposed to language modeling require communication and language-based abilities, while those most exposed to image generation require visual or spatial abilities.
- Highly-educated, highly-paid, white-collar occupations may be most exposed to generative AI.
- Strong, positive correlation between generative AI exposure and median salaries, required education levels, and the presence of creative abilities within an occupation.
- There is positive correlation between generative AI exposure and percent of female, White, and Asian representation in occupations in US workforce. There is negative correlation between generative AI exposure and percent of male, Black, and Hispanic representation.

### Approach summary
- Estimate when technologies including generative AI will reach median and top quartile human performance against 18 different capabilities through expert assessments.
- Map these assessments to DWAs and occupations to develop scenarios of technical automation potential increasing over time.
- Model scenarios for automation adoption for DWAs, occupations and countries that include technical automation potential, solution integration timelines, economic feasibility versus wage rates, and technology diffusion rates.

### Data collection
- Occupation and detailed work activity data was sourced from O*NET.
- Employment and wage data was sourced from national statistical agencies (such as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics).

### Key relevant findings
- The capabilities of generative AI have increased the share of time spent on work activities that theoretically could be automated by adapting technologies available in 2023 from about half to two-thirds of all time.
- The pace of adoption is likely to accelerate, with estimates that half of today’s work activities could be automated in scenarios that range from 2030 to 2060, with a mid-point in 2045—or roughly a decade earlier than the mid-point estimate produced by our 2017 scenarios.
- Experts’ assessment shows much of this acceleration in the potential for technical automation is due to generative AI’s increased natural language capabilities.
- Unlike most automation in the past, the impact of generative AI will fall heavily on occupations requiring higher levels of education and commanding higher wages.
- Generative AI could increase labor productivity by D1 percent to 0.6 percent annually over the next 20 years. When combined with other technologies, automation overall could contribute 0.5 to 3.4 percent annually to productivity growth, assuming labor is redeployed at today’s productivity levels and not including general equilibrium effects.

# The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier

We assessed the technical potential for automation across the global economy through an analysis of the component activities of each occupation. Our analysis covers 47 countries representing more than 80 percent of the global economy. We used the US Bureau of Labor Statistics O*Net data set that maps about 850 occupations to approximately 2,100 detailed work activities.

Each detailed work activity was assessed against 18 capabilities that could potentially be automated based on the level of performance necessary to successfully perform that activity. These assessments were informed by academic research, McKinsey expertise, and industry experts. We defined four possible levels of requirement for each capability, ranging from not required to top-quartile human performance. Please refer to exhibits A1 to A4 of the technical appendix in the January 2017 McKinsey Global Institute report, *A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity* for more details on the capabilities and the four requirement levels.

## Assigning the required level of capabilities to activities

We used a machine learning algorithm to score the approximately 2,100 work activities in relation to the 18 performance capabilities. To train the algorithm, we devised a list of keywords with input from experts. The algorithm scores each activity by matching keywords from the capability to the activity title. These assessments were checked manually, and where we found anomalies, special requirements, or a need for nuance, we made adjustments—for example, in assessing the level of capabilities needed to navigate in extreme weather or on uneven surfaces and other unpredictable settings, or the different physical capabilities required by a kindergarten teacher compared with a middle school teacher.

### 1. Modeling of automation adoption timelines

Our adoption model assesses the automation development and adoption timeline at activity level for more than 850 occupations across 19 sectors and 47 countries that represent more than 80 percent of the global economy. We divide the adoption process into four phases: technical feasibility, solution development, economic feasibility, and end-user adoption.

#### Technical feasibility

For a detailed work activity to be automated, technology must exist that performs at the required level for each of the 18 capabilities. To update the progression scenarios for the performance capabilities over time, we surveyed experts in generative AI. We also conducted interviews with industry leaders and academic experts. Based on these assessments, we updated the expected time frames to reach each level of performance for each capability. In our analysis and interaction with experts, we focused on the following capabilities that could be affected by generative AI:

- Natural-language understanding
- Natural-language generation
- Social and emotional reasoning
- Emotional and social output
- Social and emotional sensing
- Coordination with multiple agents
- Generating novel patterns or categories
- Creativity

# Solution Development
- Logical reasoning and problem solving
- Output articulation or display
- Sensory perception

## Solution Development
We also updated our estimates for how long it would take to develop a solution that could integrate automation technologies once technical feasibility was established, based on a series of expert interviews. The original estimates were developed by examining the development time and technical capabilities for more than 100 previously developed automation solutions, including hardware and software solutions.

## Economic Feasibility
Once a solution is developed, we assume activities will start to be automated when the cost of the solution falls below the level of wages paid to a human to do that activity. For this calculation, we accounted for the evolution of solution costs as well as the evolution of wages.

## Solution Cost Evolution
Based on the capability requirements, solutions are classified into two categories: hardware and software. If a solution requires sensory perception, fine motor skills and dexterity, gross motor skills, or mobility, it is classified as a hardware solution. Otherwise, it is classified as a software solution. For a given solution, the initial cost is estimated as a percentage of the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity across all the countries we modeled. We estimated the initial cost by examining several examples of solutions developed using different mixes of hardware and software. Based on our research, most software solutions have relatively low initial costs as a percentage of the human labor cost. Some solutions that require a combination of both software and hardware components have a higher initial cost. To be conservative, we excluded certain solutions with advantages that could be derived only from very specific scenarios or that include noneconomic benefits such as increased quality and efficiency or decreased error rates. The range of initial solution costs we modeled is 20 to 70 percent of the highest hourly wage for the corresponding activity for hardware, and 0 to 20 percent for software.

In our model, solution costs decrease as technology advances. Hardware solution costs decline by 16.0 percent per year, and software solution costs decline by 5.3 percent per year. We triangulate the consumer price index and supplier surveys to estimate the reduction in hardware solution costs. For this, we use computer software and accessories indexes to estimate software solution cost reduction. For consumer price inflation, we used consumer price index data for personal computers and peripheral equipment. For computer software and accessories, we use data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. For software solution costs, we use a survey of prices from the International Federation of Robotics. Further work could be done to refine the estimation; however, given software's low starting cost, annual reductions have little impact on final automation results.

## Wage Evolution
We model the wage evolution for each country in two stages. From 2023 to 2030, we apply country-level growth estimates for all countries and convert them into 2010 constant US dollars by dividing nominal GDP by the corresponding country-level price deflator (2010 base) and multiply the exchange rate to the dollar (2010 base). We then calculate a CAGR for each country from 2022 to 2030. For 2030 onward, we grouped the 47 countries for which we have data into two cohorts using a cutoff country-level annual wage, based on the wage distribution from 2022 to 2030. Countries within the same cohort grow at the same rate. We reclassify countries each year. As a country advances into the next cohort, the appropriate growth rate is applied.

# Adoption and deployment
Adoption can start once automation solutions are economically feasible, but several factors can hinder or enable the timing and pace of adoption. Solutions requiring different technologies have varying levels of ease of integration. It takes time to integrate capabilities into current technical platforms and combine them into an organic entity. Barriers also exist on the organization side. Human talent and organization structures might act as bottlenecks to implementation. Policies and regulations could also slow down or accelerate technology innovation and adoption. Finally, depending on their preferences, consumers might have varied levels of acceptance for automated solutions that could affect the pace of adoption.

To incorporate all these factors, we used the mathematics of the Bass diffusion model, a well-known and widely used function in forecasting, especially for new product sales forecasting and technology forecasting.

\[
\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)} = (p + qF(t))
\]

Where \(F(t)\) is the installed base fraction (that is, adoption of given technology or product) and \(f(t)\) is the corresponding rate of change.

The function in our case also contains two key parameters: \(p\) parameter (the inherent tendency of consumers to adopt new technology), and \(q\) parameter (the tendency of consumers to adopt based on peer adoption). Parameters are estimated through ordinary least square regression. In the absence of data, \(p\) and \(q\) parameter values from meta analyses can be used if a saturation value is known or can be guessed.

We then simulated two scenarios for historic technology adoption curves. The technologies we used are stents, airbags, laparoscopic surgery, MRI, smartphones, TVs, antilock braking systems, online air booking, cellphones, color TVs, SX/EW leaching, personal computers, electronic stability control, instrument landing systems, dishwashers, and pacemakers. The fitted values of parameters \(p\) and \(q\) are consistent with other academic research. It takes about five years to reach 50 percent adoption in the earliest scenario and approximately 16 years in the latest scenario.

## 2. Work hours that could be automated
The impact of automation on work hours across different capability levels is estimated below for the technical automation potential and automation adoption:

### Impact by occupation by scenario:
| Description | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Number of FTEs × % automation estimate by scenario |  |

### Impact by activity:
| Description | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Number of FTEs × time spent on activity per year × % percent automation estimate by scenario |  |

### Impact by occupation group:
| Description | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| \(\sum_{occupation} (Number of FTEs × % percent automation estimate by scenario)\) |  |

## 3. Impact of automation on productivity
We used GDP per FTE as the measure of productivity. We calculated automation output under different scenarios by multiplying the projected number of FTEs by the estimated automation adoption rate. To maintain consistency with other data sources, we made several additional assumptions. We considered only job activities that are available and well defined as of the date of this report. Also, to be conservative, we assumed that automation has a labor

# Additional GDP Impact of Automation

Under the assumptions outlined above, we calculated the GDP impact of automation adoption by country as follows:

**Additional GDP impact of automation = FTE impact of automation X productivity**

The additional GDP impact of automation is then added to 2022 GDP to estimate the productivity impact of automation.
